The Effect of Smartphone App-Based Interventions for Patients With Hypertension: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Xu H, Long H.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Oct 19;8(10):e21759. doi: 10.2196/21759.,Xu H,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/10/19,PMC7605981,,10.2196/21759,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of premature death. People with hypertension who do not comply with recommended treatment strategies have a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, leading to hospitalization and consequently greater health care costs. The smartphone, which is now ubiquitous, offers a convenient tool to aid in the treatment of hypertension through the use of apps targeting lifestyle management, and such app-based interventions have shown promising results. In particular, recent evidence has shown the feasibility, acceptability, and success of digital interventions in changing the behavior of people with chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically compile available evidence to determine the overall effect of smartphone apps on blood pressure control, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes for people with hypertension. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials related to the influence of an app-based intervention in people with hypertension. Data extracted from the included studies were subjected to a meta-analysis to compare the effects of the smartphone app intervention to a control. RESULTS: Eight studies with a total of 1657 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis of 6 studies assessing systolic blood pressure showed a significant overall effect in favor of the smartphone intervention (weighted mean difference -2.28, 95% CI -3.90-0.66). Pooled analysis of studies assessing medication adherence demonstrated a significant effect (P<.001) in favor of the intervention group (standard mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.26-0.50) with low heterogeneity (I(2)=0%). No difference between groups was demonstrated with respect to physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: A smartphone intervention leads to a reduction in blood pressure and an increase in medication adherence for people with hypertension. Future research should focus on the effect of behavior coaching apps on medication adherence, lifestyle change, and blood pressure reduction."
Factors Influencing Adherence to mHealth Apps for Prevention or Management of Noncommunicable Diseases: Systematic Review,"Jakob R, Harperink S, Rudolf AM, Fleisch E, Haug S, Mair JL, Salamanca-Sanabria A, Kowatsch T.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 May 25;24(5):e35371. doi: 10.2196/35371.,Jakob R,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/05/25,PMC9178451,,10.2196/35371,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps show vast potential in supporting patients and health care systems with the increasing prevalence and economic costs of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. However, despite the availability of evidence-based mHealth apps, a substantial proportion of users do not adhere to them as intended and may consequently not receive treatment. Therefore, understanding the factors that act as barriers to or facilitators of adherence is a fundamental concern in preventing intervention dropouts and increasing the effectiveness of digital health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to help stakeholders develop more effective digital health interventions by identifying factors influencing the continued use of mHealth apps targeting NCDs. We further derived quantified adherence scores for various health domains to validate the qualitative findings and explore adherence benchmarks. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search (January 2007 to December 2020) was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library. Data on intended use, actual use, and factors influencing adherence were extracted. Intervention-related and patient-related factors with a positive or negative influence on adherence are presented separately for the health domains of NCD self-management, mental health, substance use, nutrition, physical activity, weight loss, multicomponent lifestyle interventions, mindfulness, and other NCDs. Quantified adherence measures, calculated as the ratio between the estimated intended use and actual use, were derived for each study and compared with the qualitative findings. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 2862 potentially relevant articles, of which 99 (3.46%) were included as part of the inclusion criteria. A total of 4 intervention-related factors indicated positive effects on adherence across all health domains: personalization or tailoring of the content of mHealth apps to the individual needs of the user, reminders in the form of individualized push notifications, user-friendly and technically stable app design, and personal support complementary to the digital intervention. Social and gamification features were also identified as drivers of app adherence across several health domains. A wide variety of patient-related factors such as user characteristics or recruitment channels further affects adherence. The derived adherence scores of the included mHealth apps averaged 56.0% (SD 24.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the scarce scientific evidence on factors that positively or negatively influence adherence to mHealth apps and is the first to quantitatively compare adherence relative to the intended use of various health domains. As underlying studies mostly have a pilot character with short study durations, research on factors influencing adherence to mHealth apps is still limited. To facilitate future research on mHealth app adherence, researchers should clearly outline and justify the app's intended use; report objective data on actual use relative to the intended use; and, ideally, provide long-term use and retention data."
"Effectiveness, reach, uptake, and feasibility of digital health interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials","Moschonis G, Siopis G, Jung J, Eweka E, Willems R, Kwasnicka D, Asare BY, Kodithuwakku V, Verhaeghe N, Vedanthan R, Annemans L, Oldenburg B, Manios Y; DigiCare4You Consortium.",Lancet Digit Health. 2023 Mar;5(3):e125-e143. doi: 10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00233-3.,Moschonis G,Lancet Digit Health,2023,2023/02/24,,,10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00233-3,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions have shown promising results for the management of type 2 diabetes, but a comparison of the effectiveness and implementation of the different modes is not currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA(1c) at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA(1c) reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. FINDINGS: Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA(1c)) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a -0.30 (95% CI -0.42 to -0.19) percentage point greater reduction in HbA(1c), compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA(1c) reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (-0.42% [-0.63 to -0.20]) and via SMS (-0.37% [-0.57 to -0.17]), but not when delivered via websites (-0.09% [-0.64 to 0.46]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. INTERPRETATION: Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

Mobile Technology-Based Interventions for Stroke Self-Management Support: Scoping Review,"Thompson AN, Dawson DR, Legasto-Mulvale JM, Chandran N, Tanchip C, Niemczyk V, Rashkovan J, Jeyakumar S, Wang RH, Cameron JI, Nalder E.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Dec 6;11:e46558. doi: 10.2196/46558.,Thompson AN,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/12/06,PMC10733834,,10.2196/46558,"BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in enhancing stroke self-management support using mobile health (mHealth) technology (eg, smartphones and apps). Despite this growing interest, ""self-management support"" is inconsistently defined and applied in the poststroke mHealth intervention literature, which limits efforts to synthesize and compare evidence. To address this gap in conceptual clarity, a scoping review was conducted. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to (1) identify and describe the types of poststroke mHealth interventions evaluated using a randomized controlled trial design, (2) determine whether (and how) such interventions align with well-accepted conceptualizations of self-management support (the theory by Lorig and Holman and the Practical Reviews in Self-Management Support [PRISMS] taxonomy by Pearce and colleagues), and (3) identify the mHealth functions that facilitate self-management. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted according to the methodology by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac et al. In total, 7 databases were searched. Article screening and data extraction were performed by 2 reviewers. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies (26 interventions) were included. The interventions addressed 7 focal areas (physical exercise, risk factor management, linguistic exercise, activities of daily living training, medication adherence, stroke education, and weight management), 5 types of mobile devices (mobile phones or smartphones, tablets, wearable sensors, wireless monitoring devices, and laptops), and 7 mHealth functions (educating, communicating, goal setting, monitoring, providing feedback, reminding, and motivating). Collectively, the interventions aligned well with the concept of self-management support. However, on an individual basis (per intervention), the alignment was less strong. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the results, it is recommended that future research on poststroke mHealth interventions be more theoretically driven, more multidisciplinary, and larger in scale."
Ecological momentary interventions for mental health: A scoping review,"Balaskas A, Schueller SM, Cox AL, Doherty G.",PLoS One. 2021 Mar 11;16(3):e0248152. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0248152. eCollection 2021.,Balaskas A,PLoS One,2021,2021/03/11,PMC7951936,,10.1371/journal.pone.0248152,"BACKGROUND: The development of mobile computing technology has enabled the delivery of psychological interventions while people go about their everyday lives. The original visions of the potential of these ""ecological momentary interventions"" were presented over a decade ago, and the widespread adoption of smartphones in the intervening years has led to a variety of research studies exploring the feasibility of these aspirations. However, there is a dearth of research describing the different dimensions, characteristics, and features of these interventions, as constructed. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the definitions given for ""ecological momentary interventions"" in the treatment of common mental health disorders, and describe the set of technological and interaction possibilities which have been used in the design of these interventions. METHODS: A systematic search identified relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 in the PubMed, PsycInfo, and ACM Guide to the Computing Literature databases. Following screening, data were extracted from eligible articles using a standardized extraction worksheet. Selected articles were then thematically categorized. RESULTS: The search identified 583 articles of which 64 met the inclusion criteria. The interventions target a range of mental health problems, with diverse aims, intervention designs and evaluation approaches. The studies employed a variety of features for intervention delivery, but recent research is overwhelmingly comprised of studies based on smartphone apps (30 of 42 papers that described an intervention). Twenty two studies employed sensors for the collection of data in order to provide just-in-time support or predict psychological states. CONCLUSIONS: With the shift towards smartphone apps, the vision for EMIs has begun to be realised. Recent years have seen increased exploration of the use of sensors and machine learning, but the role of humans in the delivery of EMI is also varied. The variety of capabilities exhibited by EMIs motivates development of a more precise vocabulary for capturing both automatic and human tailoring of these interventions."
The Effectiveness of Smartphone App-Based Interventions for Assisting Smoking Cessation: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Guo YQ, Chen Y, Dabbs AD, Wu Y.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Apr 20;25:e43242. doi: 10.2196/43242.,Guo YQ,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/04/20,PMC10160935,,10.2196/43242,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is a leading cause of premature death globally. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of all-cause mortality by 11%-34%. Smartphone app-based smoking cessation (SASC) interventions have been developed and are widely used. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of smartphone-based interventions for smoking cessation is currently equivocal. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of smartphone app-based interventions for smoking cessation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of smartphone interventions for smoking cessation based on the Cochrane methodology. An electronic literature search was performed using the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases to identify published papers in English or Chinese (there was no time limit regarding the publication date). The outcome was the smoking abstinence rate, which was either a 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate or a continuous abstinence rate. RESULTS: A total of 9 randomized controlled trials involving 12,967 adults were selected for the final analysis. The selected studies from 6 countries (the United States, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada, and Japan) were included in the meta-analysis between 2018 and 2022. Pooled effect sizes (across all follow-up time points) revealed no difference between the smartphone app group and the comparators (standard care, SMS text messaging intervention, web-based intervention, smoking cessation counseling, or apps as placebos without real function; odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.56, P=.06, I(2)=73.6%). Based on the subanalyses, 6 trials comparing smartphone app interventions to comparator interventions reported no significant differences in effectiveness (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85-1.26, P=.74, I(2)=57.1%). However, the 3 trials that evaluated the combination of smartphone interventions combined with pharmacotherapy compared to pharmacotherapy alone found higher smoking abstinence rates in the combined intervention (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.38-2.33, P=.74, I(2)=7.4%). All SASC interventions with higher levels of adherence were significantly more effective (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.84, P<.001, I(2)=24.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis did not support the effectiveness of delivering smartphone-based interventions alone to achieve higher smoking abstinence rates. However, the efficacy of smartphone-based interventions increased when combined with pharmacotherapy-based smoking cessation approaches.

T2DM Self-Management via Smartphone Applications: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Cui M, Wu X, Mao J, Wang X, Nie M.",PLoS One. 2016 Nov 18;11(11):e0166718. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0166718. eCollection 2016.,Cui M,PLoS One,2016,2016/11/19,PMC5115794,,10.1371/journal.pone.0166718,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions (mHealth) based on smartphone applications (apps) are promising tools to help improve diabetes care and self-management; however, more evidence on the efficacy of mHealth in diabetes care is needed. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of mHealth apps on changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood glucose, blood pressure, serum lipids, and body weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. METHODS: Two independent reviewers searched three online databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE) to identify relevant studies published between January 2005 and June 2016. Of the 2,596 articles retrieved, 13 RCTs were included. We used random effects model to estimate the pooled results. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected for the systematic review, six of which with data available containing 1,022 patients were included for the meta-analysis. There was a moderate effect on glycemic control after the mHealth app-based interventions. The overall effect on HbA1c shown as mean difference (MD) was -0.40% (-4.37 mmol/mol) (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.69 to -0.11% [-7.54 to -1.20 mmol/mol]; p = 0.007) and standardized mean differences (SMD) was -0.40% (-4.37 mmol/mol) (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.69 to -0.10% [-7.54 to -1.09 mmol/mol]; p = 0.008). A subgroup analysis showed a similar effect with -0.33% (-3.61 mmol/mol) (95% CI -0.59 to -0.06% [-6.45 to -0.66 mmol/mol]; p = 0.02) in MD and -0.38% (-4.15 mmol/mol) (95% CI -0.71 to -0.05% [-7.76 to -0.55 mmol/mol]; p = 0.02) in SMD in studies where patients' baseline HbA1c levels were less than 8.0%. No effects of mHealth app interventions were found on blood pressure, serum lipids, or weight. Assessment of overall study quality and publication bias demonstrated a low risk of bias among the six studies. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone apps offered moderate benefits for T2DM self-management. However, more research with valid study designs and longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the impact of mHealth apps for diabetes care and self-management."
Mobile Health Self-management Support for Spinal Cord Injury: Systematic Literature Review,"Bernard RM, Seijas V, Davis M, Volkova A, Diviani N, Lüscher J, Sabariego C.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Apr 26;11:e42679. doi: 10.2196/42679.,Bernard RM,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/04/26,PMC10173031,,10.2196/42679,"BACKGROUND: Self-management plays a critical role in maintaining and improving the health of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Despite their potential, existing mobile health (mHealth) self-management support (SMS) tools for SCI have not been comprehensively described in terms of their characteristics and approaches. It is important to have an overview of these tools to know how best to select, further develop, and improve them. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic literature review was to identify mHealth SMS tools for SCI and summarize their characteristics and approaches to offering SMS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature published between January 2010 and March 2022 was conducted across 8 bibliographic databases. The data synthesis was guided by the self-management task taxonomy by Corbin and Strauss, the self-management skill taxonomy by Lorig and Holman, and the Practical Reviews in Self-Management Support taxonomy. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standards guided the reporting. RESULTS: A total of 24 publications reporting on 19 mHealth SMS tools for SCI were included. These tools were introduced from 2015 onward and used various mHealth technologies and multimedia formats to provide SMS using 9 methods identified by the Practical Reviews in Self-Management Support taxonomy (eg, social support and lifestyle advice and support). The identified tools focused on common SCI self-management areas (eg, bowel, bladder, and pain management) and overlooked areas such as sexual dysfunction problems and environmental problems, including barriers in the built environment. Most tools (12/19, 63%) unexpectedly supported a single self-management task instead of all 3 tasks (ie, medical, role, and emotional management), and emotional management tasks had very little support. All self-management skills (eg, problem-solving, decision-making, and action planning) had coverage, but a single tool addressed resource use. The identified mHealth SMS tools were similar in terms of number, introduction period, geographical distribution, and technical sophistication compared with SMS tools for other chronic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review provides one of the first descriptions of mHealth SMS tools for SCI in terms of their characteristics and approaches to offering SMS. This study's findings highlight a need for increased coverage of key SMS for SCI components; adopting comparable usability, user experience, and accessibility evaluation methods; and related research to provide more detailed reporting. Future research should consider other data sources such as app stores and technology-centric bibliographic databases to complement this compilation by identifying other possibly overlooked mHealth SMS tools. A consideration of this study's findings is expected to support the selection, development, and improvement of mHealth SMS tools for SCI."
Mobile Apps and Quality of Life in Patients With Breast Cancer and Survivors: Systematic Literature Review,"Saevarsdottir SR, Gudmundsdottir SL.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Jul 26;25:e42852. doi: 10.2196/42852.,Saevarsdottir SR,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/07/26,PMC10416803,,10.2196/42852,"BACKGROUND: Side effects of breast cancer treatment may persist long into survivorship, reducing quality of life (QOL) in patients with breast cancer and survivors. There is growing evidence for the use of digital health technologies, such as mobile apps, to support self-management, decrease symptom burden, and improve QOL in patients with cancer. However, an updated overview of the effects of mobile apps on QOL and well-being in patients with breast cancer and survivors is needed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to provide an overview of breast cancer-specific, mobile app-driven lifestyle or behavioral interventions in patient care through to survivorship and their impact on QOL and mental well-being. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were limited to original studies involving a trial of a mobile app-driven lifestyle or behavioral intervention for patients with breast cancer or survivors and using QOL or well-being measures. The results of the studies that met the inclusion criterion were then synthesized in text and table format. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies with the number of participants ranging from 23 to 356 met the inclusion criterion. Of the 17 reviewed studies, 7 (41%) delivered an app-only intervention, and 10 (59%) combined an app with additional supporting materials, such as SMS text messaging, telecoaching, wearables, or printed materials. Among the 17 reviewed studies, 6 (35%) focused on aiding patients with breast cancer during the active treatment phase (excluding ongoing hormone therapy), whereas the remaining 11 (65%) focused on survivorship. The majority of the studies (14/17, 82%) observed some positive effects on QOL or well-being measures. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the review indicate that mobile apps are a promising avenue for improving QOL and well-being in breast cancer care. Positive effects were observed in patients undergoing active treatment in all reviewed studies, but effects were less clear after chemotherapy and in long-term survivors. Although lifestyle and behavioral digital interventions are still being developed, and further research should still be pursued, the available data suggest that current mobile health apps aid patients with breast cancer and survivors."
Mobile apps used for people living with multiple sclerosis: A scoping review,"Howard Z, Win KT, Guan V.",Mult Scler Relat Disord. 2023 May;73:104628. doi: 10.1016/j.msard.2023.104628. Epub 2023 Mar 21.,Howard Z,Mult Scler Relat Disord,2023,2023/04/01,,,10.1016/j.msard.2023.104628,"BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder. People living with MS (plwMS) require long-term, multidisciplinary care in both clinical and community settings. MS-specific mHealth interventions have advanced in the form of clinical treatments, rehabilitation, disease monitoring and self-management of disease. However, mHealth interventions for plwMS appear to have limited proof of clinical efficacy. As native mobile apps target specific mobile operating systems, they tend to have better interactive designs leveraging platform-specific guidelines. Thus, to improve such efficacy, it is pivotal to explore the design characteristics of native mobile apps used for plwMS. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the design characteristics of native mobile apps used for adults living with MS in academic settings. METHODS: A scoping review of studies was conducted. A literature search was performed through PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library. Per native mobile apps, characteristics, persuasive technology elements and evaluations were summarized. RESULTS: A total of 14 native mobile apps were identified and 43% of the identified apps were used for data collection (n=6). Approximately 70% of the included apps involved users (plwMS) whilst developing (n=10). A total of three apps utilized embedded sensors. Videos or photos were used for physical activity interventions (n=2) and gamification principles were applied for cognitive and/or motor rehabilitation interventions (n=3). Behavior change theories were integrated into the design of the apps for fatigue management and physical activity. Regarding persuasive technology, the design principles of primary support were applied across all identified apps. The elements of dialogue support and social support were the least applied. The methods for evaluating the identified apps were varied. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the identified apps were in the early stages of development and had a user-centered design. By applying the persuasive systems design model, interaction design qualities and features of the identified mobile apps in academic settings were systematically evaluated at a deeper level. Identifying the digital functionality and interface design of mobile apps for plwMS will help researchers to better understand interactive design and how to incorporate these concepts in mHealth interventions for improvement of clinical efficacy."
mHealth Apps Using Behavior Change Techniques to Self-report Data: Systematic Review,"Aguiar M, Trujillo M, Chaves D, Álvarez R, Epelde G.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 Sep 9;10(9):e33247. doi: 10.2196/33247.,Aguiar M,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/09/09,PMC9508675,,10.2196/33247,"BACKGROUND: The popularization of mobile health (mHealth) apps for public health or medical care purposes has transformed human life substantially, improving lifestyle behaviors and chronic condition management. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify behavior change techniques (BCTs) commonly used in mHealth, assess their effectiveness based on the evidence reported in interventions and reviews to highlight the most appropriate techniques to design an optimal strategy to improve adherence to data reporting, and provide recommendations for future interventions and research. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of studies published between 2010 and 2021 in relevant scientific databases to identify and analyze mHealth interventions using BCTs that evaluated their effectiveness in terms of user adherence. Search terms included a mix of general (eg, data, information, and adherence), computer science (eg, mHealth and BCTs), and medicine (eg, personalized medicine) terms. RESULTS: This systematic review included 24 studies and revealed that the most frequently used BCTs in the studies were feedback and monitoring (n=20), goals and planning (n=14), associations (n=14), shaping knowledge (n=12), and personalization (n=7). However, we found mixed effectiveness of the techniques in mHealth outcomes, having more effective than ineffective outcomes in the evaluation of apps implementing techniques from the feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, associations, and personalization categories, but we could not infer causality with the results and suggest that there is still a need to improve the use of these and many common BCTs for better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Personalization, associations, and goals and planning techniques were the most used BCTs in effective trials regarding adherence to mHealth apps. However, they are not necessarily the most effective since there are studies that use these techniques and do not report significant results in the proposed objectives; there is a notable overlap of BCTs within implemented app components, suggesting a need to better understand best practices for applying (a combination of) such techniques and to obtain details on the specific BCTs used in mHealth interventions. Future research should focus on studies with longer follow-up periods to determine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on behavior change to overcome the limited evidence in the current literature, which has mostly small-sized and single-arm experiments with a short follow-up period."
Context-Aware Systems for Chronic Disease Patients: Scoping Review,"Yin K, Laranjo L, Tong HL, Lau AY, Kocaballi AB, Martin P, Vagholkar S, Coiera E.",J Med Internet Res. 2019 Jun 17;21(6):e10896. doi: 10.2196/10896.,Yin K,J Med Internet Res,2019,2019/06/19,PMC6601254,,10.2196/10896,"BACKGROUND: Context-aware systems, also known as context-sensitive systems, are computing applications designed to capture, interpret, and use contextual information and provide adaptive services according to the current context of use. Context-aware systems have the potential to support patients with chronic conditions; however, little is known about how such systems have been utilized to facilitate patient work. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the different tasks and contexts in which context-aware systems for patient work were used as well as to assess any existing evidence about the impact of such systems on health-related process or outcome measures. METHODS: A total of 6 databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ACM Digital, Web of Science, and Scopus) were scanned using a predefined search strategy. Studies were included in the review if they focused on patients with chronic conditions, involved the use of a context-aware system to support patients' health-related activities, and reported the evaluation of the systems by the users. Studies were screened by independent reviewers, and a narrative synthesis of included studies was conducted. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 1478 citations; 6 papers were included, all published from 2009 onwards. The majority of the papers were quasi-experimental and involved pilot and usability testing with a small number of users; there were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of a context-aware system. In the included studies, context was captured using sensors or self-reports, sometimes involving both. Most studies used a combination of sensor technology and mobile apps to deliver personalized feedback. A total of 3 studies examined the impact of interventions on health-related measures, showing positive results. CONCLUSIONS: The use of context-aware systems to support patient work is an emerging area of research. RCTs are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of context-aware systems in improving patient work, self-management practices, and health outcomes in chronic disease patients."
Digital Health Technologies for Long-term Self-management of Osteoporosis: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Alhussein G, Hadjileontiadis L.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 Apr 21;10(4):e32557. doi: 10.2196/32557.,Alhussein G,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/04/22,PMC9073608,,10.2196/32557,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is the fourth most common chronic disease worldwide. The adoption of preventative measures and effective self-management interventions can help improve bone health. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies can play a key role in the care and self-management of patients with osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE: This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of the currently available mHealth apps targeting osteoporosis self-management, aiming to determine the current status, gaps, and challenges that future research could address, as well as propose appropriate recommendations. METHODS: A systematic review of all English articles was conducted, in addition to a survey of all apps available in iOS and Android app stores as of May 2021. A comprehensive literature search (2010 to May 2021) of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore was conducted. Articles were included if they described apps dedicated to or useful for osteoporosis (targeting self-management, nutrition, physical activity, and risk assessment) delivered on smartphone devices for adults aged >/=18 years. Of the 32 articles, a random effects meta-analysis was performed on 13 (41%) studies of randomized controlled trials, whereas the 19 (59%) remaining studies were only included in the narrative synthesis as they did not provide enough data. RESULTS: In total, 3906 unique articles were identified. Of these 3906 articles, 32 (0.81%) articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in depth. The 32 studies comprised 14,235 participants, of whom, on average, 69.5% (n=9893) were female, with a mean age of 49.8 (SD 17.8) years. The app search identified 23 relevant apps for osteoporosis self-management. The meta-analysis revealed that mHealth-supported interventions resulted in a significant reduction in pain (Hedges g -1.09, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.45) and disability (Hedges g -0.77, 95% CI -1.59 to 0.05). The posttreatment effect of the digital intervention was significant for physical function (Hedges g 2.54, 95% CI -4.08 to 4.08) but nonsignificant for well-being (Hedges g 0.17, 95% CI -1.84 to 2.17), physical activity (Hedges g 0.09, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.50), anxiety (Hedges g -0.29, 95% CI -6.11 to 5.53), fatigue (Hedges g -0.34, 95% CI -5.84 to 5.16), calcium (Hedges g -0.05, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.50), vitamin D intake (Hedges g 0.10, 95% CI -4.05 to 4.26), and trabecular score (Hedges g 0.06, 95% CI -1.00 to 1.12). CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis apps have the potential to support and improve the management of the disease and its symptoms; they also appear to be valuable tools for patients and health professionals. However, most of the apps that are currently available lack clinically validated evidence of their efficacy and focus on a limited number of symptoms. A more holistic and personalized approach within a cocreation design ecosystem is needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO 2021 CRD42021269399; https://tinyurl.com/2sw454a9."
Mobile-Based Interventions for Dietary Behavior Change and Health Outcomes: Scoping Review,"Kankanhalli A, Shin J, Oh H.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Jan 21;7(1):e11312. doi: 10.2196/11312.,Kankanhalli A,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/01/22,PMC6360385,,10.2196/11312,"BACKGROUND: Mobile apps are being widely used for delivering health interventions, with their ubiquitous access and sensing capabilities. One such use is the delivery of interventions for healthy eating behavior. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive view of the literature on the use of mobile interventions for eating behavior change. We synthesized the studies with such interventions and mapped out their input methods, interventions, and outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a scoping literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and PsycINFO databases to identify relevant papers published between January 2013 and April 2018. We also hand-searched relevant themes of journals in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and registered protocols. Studies were included if they provided and assessed mobile-based interventions for dietary behavior changes and/or health outcomes. RESULTS: The search resulted in 30 studies that we classified by 3 main aspects: input methods, mobile-based interventions, and dietary behavior changes and health outcomes. First, regarding input methods, 5 studies allowed photo/voice/video inputs of diet information, whereas text input methods were used in the remaining studies. Other than diet information, the content of the input data in the mobile apps included user's demographics, medication, health behaviors, and goals. Second, we identified 6 categories of intervention contents, that is, self-monitoring, feedback, gamification, goal reviews, social support, and educational information. Although all 30 studies included self-monitoring as a key component of their intervention, personalized feedback was a component in 18 studies, gamification was used in 10 studies, goal reviews in 5 studies, social support in 3 studies, and educational information in 2 studies. Finally, we found that 13 studies directly examined the effects of interventions on health outcomes and 12 studies examined the effects on dietary behavior changes, whereas only 5 studies observed the effects both on dietary behavior changes and health outcomes. Regarding the type of studies, although two-thirds of the included studies conducted diverse forms of randomized control trials, the other 10 studies used field studies, surveys, protocols, qualitative interviews, propensity score matching method, and test and reference method. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified and classified studies on mobile-based interventions for dietary behavior change as per the input methods, nature of intervention, and outcomes examined. Our findings indicated that dietary behavior changes, although playing a mediating role in improving health outcomes, have not been adequately examined in the literature. Dietary behavior change as a mechanism for the relationship between mobile-based intervention and health outcomes needs to be further investigated. Our review provides guidance for future research in this promising mobile health area."
Atrial fibrillation self-management: a mobile telephone app scoping review and content analysis,"Pearsons A, Hanson CL, Gallagher R, O'Carroll RE, Khonsari S, Hanley J, Strachan FE, Mills NL, Quinn TJ, McKinstry B, McHale S, Stewart S, Zhang M, O'Connor S, Neubeck L.",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2021 May 22;20(4):305-314. doi: 10.1093/eurjcn/zvaa014.,Pearsons A,Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,2021,2021/02/23,PMC8210674,,10.1093/eurjcn/zvaa014,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects over 1.4 million people in the UK, resulting in a five-fold increased stroke risk and a three to four times greater risk of severe, disabling stroke. Atrial fibrillation, a chronic disease, requires monitoring, medication, and lifestyle measures. A self-management approach supported by mobile health (mHealth) may empower AF self-care. To assess the need to develop new mHealth self-management interventions for those with AF this review aimed to identify commercially available AF self-management apps, analyse, and synthesize (i) characteristics, (ii) functions, (iii) privacy/security, (iv) incorporated behaviour change techniques (BCTs), and (v) quality and usability. We searched app stores for 'atrial fibrillation' and 'anticoagulation', and included apps focused on AF self-management in the review. We examined app functions, privacy statements against best practice recommendations, the inclusion of BCTs using the App Behaviour Change Scale, and app quality/usability using the Mobile App Rating Scale. From an initial search of 555 apps, five apps were included in the review. Common functions were educational content, medication trackers, and communication with healthcare professionals. Apps contained limited BCTs, lacked intuitive functions and were difficult to use. Privacy policies were difficult to read. App quality rated from poor to acceptable and no app had been evaluated in a clinical trial. The review reports a lack of commercially available AF self-management apps of sufficient standard for use in healthcare settings. This highlights the need for clinically validated mHealth interventions incorporating evidence-based BCTs to support AF self-management."
Effectiveness of mobile application interventions for stroke survivors: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Cao W, Kadir AA, Tang W, Wang J, Yuan J, Hassan II.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2024 Jan 2;24(1):6. doi: 10.1186/s12911-023-02391-1.,Cao W,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,2024,2024/01/03,PMC10763083,,10.1186/s12911-023-02391-1,"BACKGROUND: Although smartphone usage is ubiquitous, and a vast amount of mobile applications have been developed for chronic diseases, mobile applications amongst stroke survivors remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of mobile applications on medication adherence, functional outcomes, cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life and knowledge on stroke in stroke survivors. METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted using key search terms in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases until 16 March 2023 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trial (CCTs) of mobile application interventions among stroke survivors. Two reviewers independently screened the literature in accordance with the eligibility criteria and collected data from the articles included. Outcomes included medication adherence,functional outcomes,cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life,and knowledge of stroke. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies involving 2983 participants across nine countries were included in this review. Sixteen trials involved health care professionals in app use, and seven trials reported measures to ensure app-based intervention adherence. Mobile applications targeting stroke survivors primarily encompassed three areas: rehabilitation, education and self-care. The participants in the studies primarily included young and middle-aged stroke survivors. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that mobile application intervention significantly improved trunk control ability (mean differences [MD] 3.00, 95% CI [1.80 to 4.20]; P < 0.00001), Fugl-Meyer assessment of upper extremity (MD 9.81, 95% CI [8.72 to 10.90]; P < 0.00001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD - 0.33, 95% CI [- 0.54 to - 0.11]; P = 0.003) and glycosylated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c))<7 levels (MD 1.95, 95% CI [1.17 to 3.25]; P = 0.01). However, the mobile application intervention did not differ significantly in medication adherence, 10-min walk test (10 MWT), Barthel index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, smoking, health-related quality of life and knowledge of stroke. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that mobile application interventions may have a potential benefit to stroke survivors, but clinical effectiveness should be established. More studies using rigorous designs are warranted to understand their usefulness. Future research should also involve more older adult stroke survivors."
Effectiveness of mobile health interventions for pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Wei HX, Yang YL, Luo TY, Chen WQ.",J Obstet Gynaecol. 2023 Dec;43(2):2245906. doi: 10.1080/01443615.2023.2245906.,Wei HX,J Obstet Gynaecol,2023,2023/08/22,,,10.1080/01443615.2023.2245906,"Gestational diabetes mellitus is a growing global health problem. Inadequate management during pregnancy can lead to maternal and foetal complications. Currently, mobile health (mHealth) delivers healthcare services, playing an increasingly important role in the management of blood glucose in GDM. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth intervention in pregnant women with GDM. Based on randomised controlled trials of mHealth application in GDM patients searched from the database, literature screening, data extraction, and quality evaluation were conducted independently by two researchers. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 software. The review included 27 studies with a total of 3483 patients. The results showed a significant improvement in glycemic control. In addition, mHealth interventions could reduce the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve self-management ability. In a subgroup analysis, recording of delivery mode and WeChat combined phone call indicated significant differences with mHealth interventions. It was suggested that mHealth interventions imposed a positive effect on glycemic control and reduction of adverse pregnancy outcomes in GDM patients. Our results demonstrated that the application of mHealth interventions can act as an effective and feasible approach to self-management to promote the self-management level and awareness of GDM patients."
Efficacy of Mobile Health for Self-management of Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Theory-Guided Systematic Review,"Delva S, Waligora Mendez KJ, Cajita M, Koirala B, Shan R, Wongvibulsin S, Vilarino V, Gilmore DR, Han HR.",J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2021 Jan/Feb;36(1):34-55. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0000000000000659.,Delva S,J Cardiovasc Nurs,2021,2020/02/11,PMC7713761,,10.1097/JCN.0000000000000659,"BACKGROUND: Although mobile health (mHealth) technologies are burgeoning in the research arena, there is a lack of mHealth interventions focused on improving self-management of individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to critically and systematically review the efficacy of mHealth interventions for self-management of CMRF while evaluating quality, limitations, and issues with disparities using the technology acceptance model as a guiding framework. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Lilacs were searched to identify research articles published between January 2008 and November 2018. Articles were included if they were published in English, included adults, were conducted in the United States, and used mHealth to promote self-care or self-management of CMRFs. A total of 28 articles were included in this review. RESULTS: Studies incorporating mHealth have been linked to positive outcomes in self-management of diabetes, physical activity, diet, and weight loss. Most mHealth interventions included modalities such as text messaging, mobile applications, and wearable technologies. There was a lack of studies that are (1) in resource-poor settings, (2) theoretically driven, (3) community-engaged research, (4) measuring digital/health literacy, (5) measuring and evaluating engagement, (6) measuring outcomes related to disease self-management, and (7) focused on vulnerable populations, especially immigrants. CONCLUSION: There is still a lack of mHealth interventions created specifically for immigrant populations, especially within the Latino community-the largest growing minority group in the United States. In an effort to meet this challenge, more culturally tailored mHealth interventions are needed."
Telehealth Interventions for Improving Self-Management in Patients With Hemophilia: Scoping Review of Clinical Studies,"Qian W, Lam TT, Lam HHW, Li CK, Cheung YT.",J Med Internet Res. 2019 Jul 10;21(7):e12340. doi: 10.2196/12340.,Qian W,J Med Internet Res,2019,2019/07/12,PMC6652120,,10.2196/12340,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of home therapy for hemophilia has empowered patients and their families to manage the disease more independently. However, self-management of hemophilia is demanding and complex. The uses of innovative interventions delivered by telehealth routes such as social media and Web-based and mobile apps, may help monitor bleeding events and promote the appropriate use of clotting factors among patients with hemophilia. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to summarize the literature evaluating the effectiveness of telehealth interventions for improving health outcomes in patients with hemophilia and provides direction for future research. METHODS: A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for studies that (1) focused on patients with hemophilia A or B; (2) tested the use of remote telehealth interventions via the internet, wireless, satellite, telephone, and mobile phone media on patients and caregivers; and (3) reported on at least one of the following patient-/caregiver-focused outcomes related to empowering patients/caregivers to be active decision makers in the emotional, social, and medical management of the illness: quality of life, monitoring of bleeding episodes, joint damage or other measures of functional status, medication adherence, and patients' knowledge. Implementation outcomes (user metrics, cost saving, and accuracy of electronic records) were also evaluated. Reviews, commentaries, and case reports comprising </=10 cases were excluded. RESULTS: Sixteen articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The majority of the interventions (10/16, 62%) evaluated both implementation outcomes and patient-/caregiver-focused outcomes. User performance and accuracy and comprehensiveness of electronic records were also measured in most studies (4/16, 87%). The components of the interventions were rather homogenous and typically involved electronic logging and reminders for prophylactic infusions, reporting of spontaneous and traumatic bleeding events, monitoring of infusion product usage and home inventory, and real-time communication with health care professionals and hemophilia clinics. Telemedicine-supported education and information interventions seemed to be particularly effective among adolescent and young adult patients. Although the patients reported improvements in their health-related quality of life and perception of illness, telemonitoring devices did not appear to have a significant effect on quantifiable health outcomes such as joint health. Longitudinal studies seemed to suggest that the response and adherence rates to recording decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence from this review suggests that telehealth-delivered interventions could feasibly improve patients' adherence to medication use and promote independence in disease management. Given the complexity and resources involved in developing a mature and established system, support from a dedicated network of hemophilia specialists and data managers will be required to maintain the technology, improve adherence to prophylactic treatment and recording, and validate the electronic data locally."
The effectiveness of user-focused mobile health applications in paediatric chronic disease management: A systematic review,"Karataş N, Kaya A, İşler Dalgıç A.",J Pediatr Nurs. 2022 Mar-Apr;63:e149-e156. doi: 10.1016/j.pedn.2021.09.018. Epub 2021 Sep 28.,Karataş N,J Pediatr Nurs,2022,2021/10/02,,,10.1016/j.pedn.2021.09.018,"PROBLEM: This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of user-focused mobile health (mHealth) applications in paediatric chronic disease management. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Articles were included under the Population Intervention Comparator Outcome Study (PICOS) design framework for (P) children with a chronic disease, (I) mHealth user-focused apps, (C) usual care/control groups, (O) health outcomes related to chronic diseases, and (S) randomised controlled trials. This study followed the guidelines provided by Cochrane, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis, and Mobile Health Evidence Reporting and Assessment. SAMPLE: A comprehensive literature search screening was conducted via CINAHL, PubMed, CENTRAL, ELSEVIER, SAGE, Science Direct, Scopus, Taylor Francis, WoS, and IEEE XPLORE from inception to November 15, 2020. RESULTS: The review included seven articles, which combined provided data for a total of 755 children. The effects of the mHealth applications on the investigated 31 unique outcomes of five chronic paediatric diseases were mixed, ranging from effective to no effect. The risk of bias in the included studies was mostly either high or concerning according to Risk of Bias tool 2.0. The mobile apps that were evaluated were not standalone apps but were designed to interact with and provide data to healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: Some mHealth interventions in this systematic review produced clinically meaningful and statistically relevant reductions in health outcomes related to chronic disease management. However, based on the available data, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions concerning the preferred target population of the interventions. IMPLICATION: mHealth apps may be beneficial in improving selected patient outcomes in chronic disease management. Our results may assist the digital health services of hospitals, paediatric nurses who are interested in mHealth, and children who have a chronic disease."
Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention in the Treatment of Psychotic Disorders: A Systematic Review,"Bell IH, Lim MH, Rossell SL, Thomas N.",Psychiatr Serv. 2017 Nov 1;68(11):1172-1181. doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.201600523. Epub 2017 Jul 3.,Bell IH,Psychiatr Serv,2017,2017/07/04,,,10.1176/appi.ps.201600523,"OBJECTIVE: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) are technologies used to track fluctuations in experiences and prompt behavioral responses within the context of a person's daily life. Most commonly delivered via smartphone, EMA and EMI have potential to provide simple, cost-effective, and user-led treatment for psychotic disorders. This systematic review aimed to synthesize current research exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic disorders. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted identifying studies published between 1980 and July 7, 2016, by searching PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with combinations of search terms related to mobile devices, EMA and EMI, and psychotic disorders. RESULTS: Of 1,623 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for the review. These studies found satisfactory feasibility and acceptability and preliminary evidence of improved clinical outcomes. The interventions, which had a broad array of features, targeted remote monitoring of illness and symptoms, and they also targeted illness self-management by using momentary reminders or instructions for behaviors, including medication adherence, management of symptoms and psychosocial impairments, daily living skills, and goal achievement. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review provide preliminary support for the clinical utility of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Future research should explore further applications of these technologies with larger sample sizes and controlled designs."
eHealth interventions to support colorectal cancer patients' self-management after discharge from surgery-an integrative literature review,"Husebø ALM, Søreide JA, Kørner H, Storm M, Wathne HB, Richardson A, Morken IM, Urstad KH, Nordfonn OK, Karlsen B.",Support Care Cancer. 2023 Dec 6;32(1):11. doi: 10.1007/s00520-023-08191-7.,Husebø ALM,Support Care Cancer,2023,2023/12/06,PMC10700211,,10.1007/s00520-023-08191-7,"INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) creates elevated self-management demands and unmet support needs post-discharge. Follow-up care through eHealth post-primary surgery may be an effective means of supporting patients' needs. This integrative review describes the evidence regarding eHealth interventions post-hospital discharge focusing on delivery mode, user-interface and content, patient intervention adherence, impact on patient-reported outcomes and experiences of eHealth. METHODS: A university librarian performed literature searches in 2021 using four databases. After screening 1149 records, the authors read 30 full-text papers and included and extracted data from 26 papers. Two authors analysed the extracted data using the 'framework synthesis approach'. RESULTS: The 26 papers were published between 2012 and 2022. The eHealth interventions were mainly delivered by telephone with the assistance of healthcare professionals, combined with text messages or video conferencing. The user interfaces included websites, applications and physical activity (PA) trackers. The interventions comprised the monitoring of symptoms or health behaviours, patient information, education and counselling. Evidence showed a better psychological state and improved PA. Patients reported high satisfaction with eHealth. However, patient adherence was inadequately reported. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions may positively impact CRC patients' anxiety and PA regardless of the user interface. Patients prefer technology combined with a human element."
Standalone Smartphone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Ecological Momentary Interventions to Increase Mental Health: Narrative Review,"Marciniak MA, Shanahan L, Rohde J, Schulz A, Wackerhagen C, Kobylińska D, Tuescher O, Binder H, Walter H, Kalisch R, Kleim B.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Nov 12;8(11):e19836. doi: 10.2196/19836.,Marciniak MA,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/11/12,PMC7691088,,10.2196/19836,"BACKGROUND: A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphones with the aim of increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and providing scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, which are considered the gold standard for the treatment of most mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates standalone smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) built on principles derived from CBT that aim to improve mental health. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2020. We included studies focusing on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, for example, app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, that is, choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in the primary outcomes used in the studies. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (mean 70.8%, SD 15.3; n=4 studies) and satisfying for users (mean 72.6%, SD 17.2; n=7 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily lives. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable, and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics."
Nursing Intervention using smartphone technologies; a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Jeon E, Park HA.",Stud Health Technol Inform. 2015;210:321-5.,Jeon E,Stud Health Technol Inform,2015,2015/05/21,,,,"We reviewed mobile technology-based interventions in nursing and computed effect size of the interventions. We searched eight databases (KoreaMED, KMBASE, KISS, NDSL, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane central library and CINAHL) using three sets of terms: mobile application, mobile app, mobile phone or smartphone; health or healthcare; and nursing. The study design, mobile technology, sample size and clinical outcomes were extracted from each study. A total of 38 studies were selected for review. Seven and six studies were used in meta-analyses for weight and fasting plasma glucose changes respectively. We found that mobile interventions used in nursing have different characteristics compared to those in other disciplines. We also found that mobile interventions in nursing led to significant improvement in weight and glucose control."

The objectives of this literature review were to determine the extent to which research-validated iCBTs were available to the public, as well as to determine their therapeutic content. A literature review of RCTs for iCBTs was conducted on July 30, 2021. For each iCBT, interventions were rated by content and compared to commercially available smartphone apps. Our search yielded 80 studies using 41 unique iCBTs. Of these, only 6 (15%) were completely available to the public, more than half were not publicly available (46%), and the remaining 39% were available to the public with some restrictions (e.g., those based on the user's geographical location). When comparing iCBTs evaluated in RCTs to commercially available smartphone apps, we found that iCBTs were more likely to contain psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, problem solving, and interpersonal communication components. iCBTs from RCTs contain evidence-based content but few are available to the public. Extending beyond efficacy, attention should be paid to the dissemination of iCBTs."
Mobile Apps for Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review of Features and Content Quality,"Nicholas J, Larsen ME, Proudfoot J, Christensen H.",J Med Internet Res. 2015 Aug 17;17(8):e198. doi: 10.2196/jmir.4581.,Nicholas J,J Med Internet Res,2015,2015/08/19,PMC4642376,,10.2196/jmir.4581,"BACKGROUND: With continued increases in smartphone ownership, researchers and clinicians are investigating the use of this technology to enhance the management of chronic illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD). Smartphones can be used to deliver interventions and psychoeducation, supplement treatment, and enhance therapeutic reach in BD, as apps are cost-effective, accessible, anonymous, and convenient. While the evidence-based development of BD apps is in its infancy, there has been an explosion of publicly available apps. However, the opportunity for mHealth to assist in the self-management of BD is only feasible if apps are of appropriate quality. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify the types of apps currently available for BD in the Google Play and iOS stores and to assess their features and the quality of their content. METHODS: A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and assessment of apps. We searched the Australian Google Play and iOS stores for English-language apps developed for people with BD. The comprehensiveness and quality of information was assessed against core psychoeducation principles and current BD treatment guidelines. Management tools were evaluated with reference to the best-practice resources for the specific area. General app features, and privacy and security were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 571 apps identified, 82 were included in the review. Of these, 32 apps provided information and the remaining 50 were management tools including screening and assessment (n=10), symptom monitoring (n=35), community support (n=4), and treatment (n=1). Not even a quarter of apps (18/82, 22%) addressed privacy and security by providing a privacy policy. Overall, apps providing information covered a third (4/11, 36%) of the core psychoeducation principles and even fewer (2/13, 15%) best-practice guidelines. Only a third (10/32, 31%) cited their information source. Neither comprehensiveness of psychoeducation information (r=-.11, P=.80) nor adherence to best-practice guidelines (r=-.02, P=.96) were significantly correlated with average user ratings. Symptom monitoring apps generally failed to monitor critical information such as medication (20/35, 57%) and sleep (18/35, 51%), and the majority of self-assessment apps did not use validated screening measures (6/10, 60%). CONCLUSIONS: In general, the content of currently available apps for BD is not in line with practice guidelines or established self-management principles. Apps also fail to provide important information to help users assess their quality, with most lacking source citation and a privacy policy. Therefore, both consumers and clinicians should exercise caution with app selection. While mHealth offers great opportunities for the development of quality evidence-based mobile interventions, new frameworks for mobile mental health research are needed to ensure the timely availability of evidence-based apps to the public."
"mHealth Interventions for Self-management of Hypertension: Framework and Systematic Review on Engagement, Interactivity, and Tailoring","Cao W, Milks MW, Liu X, Gregory ME, Addison D, Zhang P, Li L.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 Mar 2;10(3):e29415. doi: 10.2196/29415.,Cao W,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/03/02,PMC8928043,,10.2196/29415,"BACKGROUND: Engagement is essential for the effectiveness of digital behavior change interventions. Existing systematic reviews examining hypertension self-management interventions via mobile apps have primarily focused on intervention efficacy and app usability. Engagement in the prevention or management of hypertension is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review explores the definition and role of engagement in hypertension-focused mobile health (mHealth) interventions, as well as how determinants of engagement (ie, tailoring and interactivity) have been implemented. METHODS: A systematic review of mobile app interventions for hypertension self-management targeting adults, published from 2013 to 2020, was conducted. A total of 21 studies were included in this systematic review. RESULTS: The engagement was defined or operationalized as a microlevel concept, operationalized as interaction with the interventions (ie, frequency of engagement, time or duration of engagement with the program, and intensity of engagement). For all 3 studies that tested the relationship, increased engagement was associated with better biomedical outcomes (eg, blood pressure change). Interactivity was limited in digital behavior change interventions, as only 7 studies provided 2-way communication between users and a health care professional, and 9 studies provided 1-way communication in possible critical conditions; that is, when abnormal blood pressure values were recorded, users or health care professionals were notified. The tailoring of interventions varied at different aspects, from the tailoring of intervention content (including goals, patient education, advice and feedback from health professionals, reminders, and motivational messages) to the tailoring of intervention dose and communication mode. Tailoring was carried out in a number of ways, considering patient characteristics such as goals, preferences, disease characteristics (eg, hypertension stage and medication list), disease self-management experience levels, medication adherence rate, and values and beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Available studies support the importance of engagement in intervention effectiveness as well as the essential roles of patient factors in tailoring, interactivity, and engagement. A patient-centered engagement framework for hypertension self-management using mHealth technology is proposed here, with the intent of facilitating intervention design and disease self-management using mHealth technology."
The effectiveness of mHealth interventions on postpartum depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Zhou C, Hu H, Wang C, Zhu Z, Feng G, Xue J, Yang Z.",J Telemed Telecare. 2022 Feb;28(2):83-95. doi: 10.1177/1357633X20917816. Epub 2020 Apr 19.,Zhou C,J Telemed Telecare,2022,2020/04/21,,,10.1177/1357633X20917816,"INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common psychiatric condition during the postnatal period that negatively impacts the well-being of both the mother and her infant. This study describes a systematic review and preliminary meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of mobile health (mHealth) interventions, which is defined as the use of portable electronic devices to support public health and medical practice, in addressing depressive symptoms among postpartum women. METHODS: Databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on PPD from database inception to December 2019. RESULTS: The initial search identified 754 studies, of which, 11 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated four types of distinct mHealth interventions and involved 2424 participants across six countries. Pooled results demonstrated that compared to the controls, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score decreased in the mHealth intervention group (mean difference: -1.09, 95% confidence interval: -1.39 to -0.79). DISCUSSION: Our study suggested that mHealth interventions may be a promising tool to complement routine clinical care in the prevention and treatment of PPD, but the clinical effectiveness of mHealth interventions needs to be better established. While most studies focused on telephone-based interventions, recent researches have also suggested the superiority and effectiveness of short messaging service (SMS) and smartphone applications, but the exact efficacy needs further evaluation. Therefore, more high-quality RCTs on app-based and SMS-based interventions are needed before the large-scale roll-out of these interventions in clinical practice."
On the efficacy of behavior change techniques in mHealth for self-management of diabetes: A meta-analysis,"El-Gayar O, Ofori M, Nawar N.",J Biomed Inform. 2021 Jul;119:103839. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103839. Epub 2021 Jun 15.,El-Gayar O,J Biomed Inform,2021,2021/06/17,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103839,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes prevalence has become a global crisis. Due to the substantial rise in smartphone use, a variety of mobile interventions have been developed to help improve the clinical outcomes of diabetes patients. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to examine specific behavior change theories and techniques used in the design of self-management mobile app-based interventions aimed at achieving glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized control trials published in PubMed/Medline and Web of Science between January 2010 and October 2020 was conducted using studies that included diabetes patients, reported on well-described mobile app-based interventions, compared mHealth to usual care, and evaluated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: We reported on 21 studies with a total of 1,920 diabetes patients. Our findings show that mHealth apps led to statistically significant clinical outcomes as compared to standard care for glycemic control (-0.38, 95% CI = -0.50 to -0.25, p < 0.0001) indicating that such interventions result in a reduction in HbA1c. Interventions that used behavior theory for developing mHealth apps were not statistically different from those that did not (p = 0.18). However, increased use of behavior change techniques (BCTs) may result in slightly higher HbA1c reduction. Among all BCTs, the most effective ones appear to be ""Action planning"" and ""Self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis provides evidence that mHealth is likely to be beneficial for diabetes patients when the right behavior change techniques are applied to realize the full advantage of the intervention. Further investigation of the role of theory in the design of mHealth app-based interventions is warranted."
Availability and use of web-based interventions for patients with head and neck cancer: a scoping review,"Kelly R, Gordon P, Thompson R, Semple C.",J Cancer Surviv. 2023 Oct;17(5):1309-1326. doi: 10.1007/s11764-022-01168-1. Epub 2022 Jan 28.,Kelly R,J Cancer Surviv,2023,2022/01/28,PMC8794623,,10.1007/s11764-022-01168-1,"PURPOSE: To identify and review the nature, scope and use of web-based interventions for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). METHOD: A scoping review guided by the methodological framework described by the Joanna Briggs Institute was performed to review empirical studies and websites. Seven electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed and PsycInfo) were searched from 2010 to 2020, data extracted and synthesised using thematic analysis. The Google search engine was employed, identifying the first 100 websites, using the search term head and neck cancer. Websites meeting eligibility criteria were assessed using the QUEST analysis tool, and descriptively summarised. RESULTS: Thirteen empirical studies and 32 websites were included. As identified by empirical studies, web-based interventions were developed to provide (1) patient information on HNC and related treatments, (2) advice and support during treatment and (3) management strategies promoting adjustment to life with and beyond HNC. The reviewed websites provided minimal information to aid shared decision-making and facilitate preparedness for treatment, with few utilising patient narratives. Web-based interventions for HNC patients were mainly text based and focused on survivorship. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of theory-based, co-designed web-based interventions using patient narratives. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: As patients increasingly look to the internet for advice and support, healthcare professionals are in a position to provide high-quality web-based interventions. There is an opportunity to rigorously develop a web-based intervention, containing narratives of peoples' lives before and after HNC treatment, aiding decision-making, preparedness for treatment and self-management."
Early Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Experience With the Use of Telehealth to Address Disparities: Scoping Review,"Bailey JE, Gurgol C, Pan E, Njie S, Emmett S, Gatwood J, Gauthier L, Rosas LG, Kearney SM, Robler SK, Lawrence RH, Margolis KL, Osunkwo I, Wilfley D, Shah VO.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Dec 7;23(12):e28503. doi: 10.2196/28503.,Bailey JE,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/12/08,PMC8693194,,10.2196/28503,"BACKGROUND: Health systems and providers across America are increasingly employing telehealth technologies to better serve medically underserved low-income, minority, and rural populations at the highest risk for health disparities. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has invested US $386 million in comparative effectiveness research in telehealth, yet little is known about the key early lessons garnered from this research regarding the best practices in using telehealth to address disparities. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes preliminary lessons from the body of research using study findings and case studies drawn from PCORI seminal patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) initiatives. The primary purpose was to identify common barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth technologies in populations at risk for disparities. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of telehealth studies addressing disparities was performed. It was guided by the Arksey and O'Malley Scoping Review Framework and focused on PCORI's active portfolio of telehealth studies and key PCOR identified by study investigators. We drew on this broad literature using illustrative examples from early PCOR experience and published literature to assess barriers and facilitators to implementing telehealth in populations at risk for disparities, using the active implementation framework to extract data. Major themes regarding how telehealth interventions can overcome barriers to telehealth adoption and implementation were identified through this review using an iterative Delphi process to achieve consensus among the PCORI investigators participating in the study. RESULTS: PCORI has funded 89 comparative effectiveness studies in telehealth, of which 41 assessed the use of telehealth to improve outcomes for populations at risk for health disparities. These 41 studies employed various overlapping modalities including mobile devices (29/41, 71%), web-based interventions (30/41, 73%), real-time videoconferencing (15/41, 37%), remote patient monitoring (8/41, 20%), and store-and-forward (ie, asynchronous electronic transmission) interventions (4/41, 10%). The studies targeted one or more of PCORI's priority populations, including racial and ethnic minorities (31/41, 41%), people living in rural areas, and those with low income/low socioeconomic status, low health literacy, or disabilities. Major themes identified across these studies included the importance of patient-centered design, cultural tailoring of telehealth solutions, delivering telehealth through trusted intermediaries, partnering with payers to expand telehealth reimbursement, and ensuring confidential sharing of private information. CONCLUSIONS: Early PCOR evidence suggests that the most effective health system- and provider-level telehealth implementation solutions to address disparities employ patient-centered and culturally tailored telehealth solutions whose development is actively guided by the patients themselves to meet the needs of specific communities and populations. Further, this evidence shows that the best practices in telehealth implementation include delivery of telehealth through trusted intermediaries, close partnership with payers to facilitate reimbursement and sustainability, and safeguards to ensure patient-guided confidential sharing of personal health information."

Epub 2021 Feb 1.,Pornak SC,Urologe A,2021,2021/02/01,,,10.1007/s00120-020-01440-1,"BACKGROUND: Side effects due to prostate cancer therapy and psychosocial strain are not always recognised during follow-up, which may result in the absence of appropriate therapy offers. Recent studies have shown a potential for improving care by integrating digital technologies like smartphone apps. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to explore the effects of apps for the assessment of side effects and distress, provision of individualised patient information and management of prostate cancer follow-up on patient outcome. Furthermore, findings on user acceptance and recommendations for implementation and evaluation were identified. METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, PSYNDEX, wiso and SpringerLink were searched for quantitative and qualitative primary studies from the period 2005 until August 2020. RESULTS: In all, 22 studies were included in the review. Apps and web-based interventions had a positive effect on physical symptoms, psychosocial distress and participation in treatment. User acceptance was predominantly good, but there were still substantial numbers of non-users. CONCLUSIONS: Apps and web-based interventions can be an effective supplement to follow-up care, especially if they are adapted to individual patient needs. Robust evidence is still lacking. There is a need for larger randomised controlled studies, particularly in the German healthcare setting."
Smartphone-Based Interventions for Physical Activity Promotion: Scoping Review of the Evidence Over the Last 10 Years,"Domin A, Spruijt-Metz D, Theisen D, Ouzzahra Y, Vögele C.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2021 Jul 21;9(7):e24308. doi: 10.2196/24308.,Domin A,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2021,2021/07/21,PMC8339983,,10.2196/24308,"BACKGROUND: Several reviews of mobile health (mHealth) physical activity (PA) interventions suggest their beneficial effects on behavior change in adolescents and adults. Owing to the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, their use in mHealth PA interventions seems obvious; nevertheless, there are gaps in the literature on the evaluation reporting processes and best practices of such interventions. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review is to analyze the development and evaluation trajectory of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions and to review systematic theory- and evidence-based practices and methods that are implemented along this trajectory. The secondary objective is to identify the range of evidence (both quantitative and qualitative) available on smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions to provide a comprehensive tabular and narrative review of the available literature in terms of its nature, features, and volume. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of qualitative and quantitative studies examining smartphone-based PA interventions published between 2008 and 2018. In line with scoping review guidelines, studies were not rejected based on their research design or quality. This review, therefore, includes experimental and descriptive studies, as well as reviews addressing smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA in all age groups (with a subanalysis conducted for adolescents). Two groups of studies were additionally included: reviews or content analyses of PA trackers and meta-analyses exploring behavior change techniques and their efficacy. RESULTS: Included articles (N=148) were categorized into 10 groups: commercial smartphone app content analyses, smartphone-based intervention review studies, activity tracker content analyses, activity tracker review studies, meta-analyses of PA intervention studies, smartphone-based intervention studies, qualitative formative studies, app development descriptive studies, qualitative follow-up studies, and other related articles. Only 24 articles targeted children or adolescents (age range: 5-19 years). There is no agreed evaluation framework or taxonomy to code or report smartphone-based PA interventions. Researchers did not state the coding method, used various evaluation frameworks, or used different versions of behavior change technique taxonomies. In addition, there is no consensus on the best behavior change theory or model that should be used in smartphone-based interventions for PA promotion. Commonly reported systematic practices and methods have been successfully identified. They include PA recommendations, trial designs (randomized controlled trials, experimental trials, and rapid design trials), mixed methods data collection (surveys, questionnaires, interviews, and focus group discussions), scales to assess app quality, and industry-recognized reporting guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based mHealth interventions aimed at promoting PA showed promising results for behavior change. Although there is a plethora of published studies on the adult target group, the number of studies and consequently the evidence base for adolescents is limited. Overall, the efficacy of smartphone-based mHealth PA interventions can be considerably improved through a more systematic approach of developing, reporting, and coding of the interventions."
Personalization Dimensions for MHealth to Improve Behavior Change: A Scoping Review,"Gosetto L, Ehrler F, Falquet G.",Stud Health Technol Inform. 2020 Nov 23;275:77-81. doi: 10.3233/SHTI200698.,Gosetto L,Stud Health Technol Inform,2020,2020/11/23,,,10.3233/SHTI200698,"Due to the large number of smartphone users, mHealth has become a popular support to foster users' health behavior change Personalization is an important factor to increase the effectiveness of mHealth interventions. Based on a literature review, we have listed and categorized personalization concepts associated with behavior change in mHealth into 4 dimensions, users, system functionalities, information, and app properties. The users dimension refers to user-related characteristics such as personality, player profile, need for cognition and perception of social norms. The system functionalities contain the functionalities that can be found in applications such as reminders as well as gamification functionalities such as collectibles. The information dimension concerns the way information is transmitted, such as the source of the message must be expert or the type of feedback to be provided. Finally, there are app properties such as the aesthetics of the application. For the next part, it would be interesting to discover the links we can make between the dimensions."
Effectiveness of Internet-Based Electronic Technology Interventions on Breastfeeding Outcomes: Systematic Review,"Almohanna AA, Win KT, Meedya S.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 May 29;22(5):e17361. doi: 10.2196/17361.,Almohanna AA,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/05/30,PMC7293063,,10.2196/17361,"BACKGROUND: Supporting women to initiate and continue breastfeeding is a global challenge. A range of breastfeeding interventions employing electronic technologies (e-technologies) are being developed, which offer different delivery modes and features over the internet; however, the impact of internet-based e-technologies on breastfeeding outcomes remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the characteristics of current internet-based breastfeeding interventions employing e-technologies and investigate the effects of internet-based e-technologies on breastfeeding outcomes. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in the following databases: Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, the Association for Computing Machinery, SpringerLink, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore. RESULTS: This systematic review included 16 studies published between 2007 and 2018, with 4018 women in 8 countries. The characteristics of the interventions were grouped based on (1) mode of delivery (web-based, mobile phone apps, and computer kiosk), (2) purpose of the interventions (education and support), and (3) key strategies (monitoring and breastfeeding tracking, personalization, online discussion forum, web-based consultation, and breastfeeding station locators). Combining educational activities with web-based personalized support through discussion forums appeared to be the most effective way to improve breastfeeding outcomes and long-term exclusive breastfeeding rates. Monitoring and breastfeeding trackers appeared to be the least effective ways. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a variety of internet-based e-technologies that professionals can use to promote, educate, and support breastfeeding women. Future internet-based breastfeeding interventions employing e-technologies might consider improving interaction with mothers and personalizing the content of the proposed interventions."
Digital Self-Management Interventions for People With Osteoarthritis: Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis,"Safari R, Jackson J, Sheffield D.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Jul 20;22(7):e15365. doi: 10.2196/15365.,Safari R,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/07/25,PMC7428148,,10.2196/15365,"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is not curable, but the symptoms can be managed through self-management programs (SMPs). Owing to the growing burden of OA on the health system and the need to ensure high-quality integrated services, delivering SMPs through digital technologies could be an economic and effective community-based approach. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of digital-based structured SMPs on patient outcomes in people with OA. METHODS: A total of 7 web-based and 3 gray literature databases were searched for randomized controlled trials assessing digital-based structured SMPs on self-reported outcomes including pain, physical function, disability, and health-related quality of life (QoL) in people with OA. Two reviewers independently screened the search results and reference lists of the identified papers and related reviews. Data on the intervention components and delivery and behavioral change techniques used were extracted. A meta-analysis, risk of bias sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis were performed where appropriate. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were included in this review involving 2687 patients with knee (n=2); knee, hip, or both (n=5); and unspecified joint (n=1) OA. SMPs were delivered via telephone plus audio and video, internet, or mobile apps. Studies reported that digital-based structured SMPs compared with the treatment as usual control group (n=7) resulted in a significant, homogeneous, medium reduction in pain and improvement in physical function (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.28, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.18 and SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.16, respectively) at posttreatment. The digital-based structured SMP effect on pain and function reduced slightly at the 12-month follow-up but remained to be medium and significant. The posttreatment effect of digital-based structured SMPs was small and significant for disability, but nonsignificant for QoL (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.03 and SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.14, respectively; each reported in 1 study only). The 12-month follow-up effect of the intervention was very small for disability and QoL. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for pain and physical function and low and very low for disability and QoL, respectively, using the GRADE approach. CONCLUSIONS: Digital-based structured SMPs may result in improvement in pain and physical function that is largely sustained at the 12-month follow-up in people with knee and hip OA. The effects on disability and QoL are smaller and less clear. The quality of evidence is moderate to low, and further research is required to confirm the findings of the review and assess the effects of digital-based structured SMPs on other health-related outcomes."
Investigating the Use of Mobile Health Interventions in Vulnerable Populations for Cardiovascular Disease Management: Scoping Review,"Wali S, Hussain-Shamsy N, Ross H, Cafazzo J.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Oct 7;7(10):e14275. doi: 10.2196/14275.,Wali S,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/10/09,PMC6803887,,10.2196/14275,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has grown to become one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The advancements of CVD-related treatments have led to a decline in CVD prevalence among individuals in high-income countries (HICs). However, these improvements do not reflect the state of individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and vulnerable subgroup populations in HICs, such as the Indigenous. To help minimize the health disparities in these populations, technology-based interventions have been offered as a potential solution, but there is concern regarding if they will be effective, or even needed, as these tools have been designed for use in HICs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore how mobile health (mHealth) interventions currently assist individuals in Indigenous communities and LMICs with CVD management. METHODS: A scoping review guided by the methods outlined by Arksey and O'Malley was conducted. A comprehensive search was completed by 2 reviewers in 5 electronic databases using keywords related to mobile health, cardiovascular disease, self-care, Indigenous communities, and LMICs. Studies were screened over 2 rounds and critically reviewed using a descriptive-analytical narrative method. Descriptive data were categorized into thematic groups reflecting the major findings related to the study objective. RESULTS: We identified a total of 11 original articles and 11 review papers that met the criteria for this scoping review. The majority of the studies included a telemonitoring- and text messaging (short message service, SMS)-related feature associated with the intervention. The use of SMS was the most common approach to effectively promote disease management among individuals in both LMICs and Indigenous communities. However, customizing for cultural considerations within the design of the intervention was highlighted as a pivotal component to encourage CVD management. Specifically, individuals emphasized that the inclusion of collaborative partnerships with community members would strengthen the effectiveness of the intervention by ensuring it was designed with the appropriate context. CONCLUSIONS: Technology-based interventions used within Indigenous communities and LMICs have shown their potential to assist individuals with managing their condition. Although the literature available regarding this topic is limited, this review outlines key components to promote the effective use of these tools in the context of these vulnerable populations."

Only studies with a control/comparison group that performed preintervention and postintervention assessments were included. RESULTS: Included studies showed a trend toward a beneficial effect of intervention on the severity of Internet addictions. The meta-analysis suggested significant effects of all included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and their educational programs. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological interventions may help to reduce addiction severity, but further RCTs are needed to identify the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy. This study provides a basis for developing future programs addressing addiction problems among adolescents."
The role of digital health interventions to improve health literacy in surgical patients: a narrative review in arthroplasty,"Davaris MT, Bunzli S, Trieu J, Dowsey MM, Choong PF.",ANZ J Surg. 2022 Oct;92(10):2474-2486. doi: 10.1111/ans.17931. Epub 2022 Aug 4.,Davaris MT,ANZ J Surg,2022,2022/08/04,,,10.1111/ans.17931,"BACKGROUND: Arthroplasty is a high-volume but costly treatment option for advanced osteoarthritis. Health literacy and patient education are modifiable factors that can improve patient outcomes in arthroplasty. Digital technologies show potential as an instrument for providing patients with reliable information. This narrative review aimed to identify the current evidence for how effective digital health interventions (DHIs) are in targeting health literacy and related constructs (including knowledge, decision-making and self-efficacy) in arthroplasty. METHODS: Six databases were searched for published studies comprising health literacy and related constructs, arthroplasty, and DHIs. The main outcome measure was health literacy. Two reviewer-authors independently screened studies according to predefined inclusion criteria and performed data extraction. Data was analysed and summarized in tabular and narrative form. RESULTS: Two thousand seven-hundred and sixty-four titles and abstracts were screened. One hundred and sixty-seven papers underwent full-text analysis. No studies used health literacy as an outcome measure; therefore, the outcome measure was broadened to include its constructs, and the full-text analysis was repeated. Thirteen studies were included. No study following a structured design for their DHI. Eleven studies demonstrated participant improvement in constructs of health literacy, including knowledge, decision-making and self-management. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests digital technology may provide new means of educating patients and improving aspects of their health literacy. More research digital technology with a structured approach, framework and standardized measures is required. Well-designed digital technology may become a useful adjunct to future patient care."

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease, and related dementias are a global health problem. Numerous mHealth interventions exist for this population, yet the effect of these interventions on health has not been systematically described. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to catalog the types of health outcomes used to measure effectiveness of mHealth interventions and assess which mHealth interventions have been shown to improve the health of persons with MCI, Alzheimer disease, and dementia. METHODS: We searched 13 databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the full Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Ei Compendex, IEEE Xplore, Applied Science & Technology Source, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar from inception through May 2017 for mHealth studies involving persons with cognitive impairment that were evaluated using at least one quantitative health outcome. Proceedings of the Annual ACM Conferences on Human Factors in Computing Systems, the ACM User Interface Software and Technology Symposium, and the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers were searched in the ACM Digital Library from 2012 to 2016. A hand search of JMIR Publications journals was also completed in July 2017. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates, our initial search returned 3955 records. Of these articles, 24 met final inclusion criteria as studies involving mHealth interventions that measured at least one quantitative health outcome for persons with MCI, Alzheimer disease, and dementia. Common quantitative health outcomes included cognition, function, mood, and quality of life. We found that 21.2% (101/476) of the fully reviewed articles were excluded because of a lack of health outcomes. The health outcomes selected were observed to be inconsistent between studies. For those studies with quantitative health outcomes, more than half (58%) reported postintervention improvements in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Results showed that many mHealth app interventions targeting those with cognitive impairment lack quantitative health outcomes as a part of their evaluation process and that there is a lack of consensus as to which outcomes to use. The majority of mHealth app interventions that incorporated health outcomes into their evaluation noted improvements in the health of persons with MCI, Alzheimer disease, and dementia. However, these studies were of low quality, leading to a grade C level of evidence. Clarification of the benefits of mHealth interventions for people with cognitive impairment requires more randomized controlled trials, larger numbers of participants, and trial designs that minimize bias.

"Considerations of diversity, equity, and inclusion in mental health apps: A scoping review of evaluation frameworks","Ramos G, Ponting C, Labao JP, Sobowale K.",Behav Res Ther. 2021 Dec;147:103990. doi: 10.1016/j.brat.2021.103990. Epub 2021 Oct 14.,Ramos G,Behav Res Ther,2021,2021/10/29,,,10.1016/j.brat.2021.103990,"Mental health applications or apps are a promising approach to reduce the pervasive unmet mental health need observed among marginalized groups. However, these groups face unique challenges to engage in and benefit from these interventions, and apps that consider issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) may be better positioned to reach them. App evaluation frameworks emerge as crucial tools for researchers, clinicians, and users to select evidence-based apps. Nevertheless, it is unclear the extent to which existing assessment tools capture DEI factors. The present scoping review identified 68 studies that employed one or more assessment tools to evaluate a mental health app, leading to 44 unique app evaluation frameworks. Results showed that most frameworks were developed after 2015, and only 58% of them considered at least one DEI criterion. Frameworks that performed exceptionally well were those that combined multiple standardized and validated measures. This lack of consideration for DEI variables may limit the ability of app-based interventions to serve marginalized communities, or even worse, create new disparities. Therefore, we provide recommendations to improve current app evaluation frameworks' cultural robustness and clinical utility, maximizing their effectiveness when working with individuals from marginalized communities."
Smartphone app-based interventions targeting physical activity for weight management: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Yen HY, Jin G, Chiu HL.",Int J Nurs Stud. 2023 Jan;137:104384. doi: 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2022.104384. Epub 2022 Oct 31.,Yen HY,Int J Nurs Stud,2023,2022/11/15,,,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2022.104384,"BACKGROUND: Being overweight and obese are major public health challenges worldwide. Smartphone apps are an innovative platform to deliver physical activity modifications for weight management. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of smartphone app-based interventions targeting physical activity for obesity-related outcomes and compare the efficacy among behavioral change techniques. METHODS: Five online databases were searched for randomized controlled trials in September 30, 2021. Hedges' g was used to compute effect sizes. The random effect models were conducted for all analyses. RESULTS: In total, 12 trials were selected for qualitative and quantitative syntheses. Smartphone app-based interventions exerted small-to-moderate effects on body weight, body mass index, and body fat percentage. The meta-regression found that the older age of participants and a longer duration of the intervention increased the effect. Subgroup analyses found that the interventions were more effective on body weight among participants with a disease or disability, and on body mass index in participants who were obese or overweight. Apps with features such as reminders, self-reporting, and a health coach used as behavioral change techniques were more effective. CONCLUSION: Smartphone apps are an effective and feasible strategy for physical activity modification using behavioral change techniques. Smartphone app-based interventions can promote physical activity for weight management."
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Intervention for Pediatric Obesity Using Mobile Technology,"Lee J, Piao M, Byun A, Kim J.",Stud Health Technol Inform. 2016;225:491-4.,Lee J,Stud Health Technol Inform,2016,2016/06/23,,,,"We reviewed the effect sizes of pediatric obesity intervention studies using mobile technology. Ten databases (Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, KoreaMED, KMBASE, KISS, NDSL, KSITI, and RISS) were reviewed, and four studies were included in a qualitative synthesis. To obtain significant change in obesity-related outcomes among elementary school students, including parents and utilizing text messages in interventions are recommended. Furthermore, devices such as accelerometers may aid obesity management. A meta-analysis of four studies indicated that the mobile intervention positively influenced dropout rates but was ineffective for outcomes of weight control, exercise, and sugar-sweetened beverage intake."
Mobile and Computer-Based Applications for Rehabilitation Monitoring and Self-Management After Knee Arthroplasty: Scoping Review,"Pritwani S, Shrivastava P, Pandey S, Kumar A, Malhotra R, Maddison R, Devasenapathy N.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2024 Jan 26;12:e47843. doi: 10.2196/47843.,Pritwani S,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2024,2024/01/26,PMC10858429,,10.2196/47843,"BACKGROUND: Successful post-knee replacement rehabilitation requires adequate access to health information, social support, and periodic monitoring by a health professional. Mobile health (mHealth) and computer-based technologies are used for rehabilitation and remote monitoring. The extent of technology use and its function in post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in low and middle-income settings are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To inform future mHealth intervention development, we conducted a scoping review to map the features and functionality of existing technologies and determine users' perspectives on telerehabilitation and technology for self-management. METHODS: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. We searched the Embase, Medline, PsycINFO via OVID, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for manuscripts published from 2001 onward. We included original research articles reporting the use of mobile or computer-based technologies by patients, health care providers, researchers, or family members. Studies were divided into the following 3 categories based on the purpose: validation studies, clinical evaluation, and end user feedback. We extracted general information on study design, technology features, proposed function, and perspectives of health care providers and patients. The protocol for this review is accessible in the Open Science Framework. RESULTS: Of the 5960 articles, 158 that reported from high-income settings contributed to the qualitative summary (64 studies on mHealth or telerehabilitation programs, 28 validation studies, 38 studies describing users' perceptions). The highest numbers of studies were from Europe or the United Kingdom and North America regarding the use of a mobile app with or without wearables and reported mainly in the last decade. No studies were from low and middle-income settings. The primary functions of technology for remote rehabilitation were education to aid recovery and enable regular, appropriate exercises; monitoring progress of pain (n=19), activity (n=20), and exercise adherence (n=30); 1 or 2-way communication with health care professionals to facilitate the continuum of care (n=51); and goal setting (n=23). Assessment of range of motion (n=16) and gait analysis (n=10) were the commonly validated technologies developed to incorporate into a future rehabilitation program. Few studies (n=14) reported end user involvement during the development stage. We summarized the reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction among users across various technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Several existing mobile and computer-based technologies facilitate post-knee replacement rehabilitation care for patients and health care providers. However, they are limited to high-income settings and may not be extrapolated to low-income settings. A systematic needs assessment of patients undergoing knee replacement and health care providers involved in rehabilitation, involving end users at all stages of development and evaluation, with clear reporting of the development and clinical evaluation can make post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in resource-poor settings accessible and cost-effective."
Ecological momentary intervention to enhance emotion regulation in healthcare workers via smartphone: a randomized controlled trial protocol,"Castilla D, Navarro-Haro MV, Suso-Ribera C, Díaz-García A, Zaragoza I, García-Palacios A.",BMC Psychiatry. 2022 Mar 5;22(1):164. doi: 10.1186/s12888-022-03800-x.,Castilla D,BMC Psychiatry,2022,2022/03/06,PMC8897724,,10.1186/s12888-022-03800-x,"BACKGROUND: CUIDA-TE is an APP that offers transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy focused on enhancing emotion regulation. As a novelty, it incorporates ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which can provide psychological support in real time, when suffering arises. The main goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CUIDA-TE to improve emotion regulation in healthcare workers, a population that has been particularly emotionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) the study sample will be composed of a minimum of 174 healthcare workers. They will be randomly assigned to a 2-month EMI group (CUIDA-TE APP, n >/= 58), a 2-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA) only group (MONITOR EMOCIONAL APP, n >/= 58), or a wait-list control group (no daily monitoring nor intervention, n >/= 58). CUIDA-TE will provide EMI if EMA reveals emotional problems, poor sleep quality/quantity, burnout, stress, or low perceived self-efficacy when regulating emotions. Depression will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include emotion regulation, quality of life, and resilience. Treatment acceptance and usability will also be measured. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at the 3-month follow-up for all groups. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that evaluates the efficacy of an APP-based EMI to improve emotion regulation skills in healthcare workers. This type of intervention might ultimately help disseminate treatments and reach a larger number of individuals than traditional face-to-face individual therapies.

Evaluation of Patient-Facing Mobile Apps to Support Physiotherapy Care: Systematic Review,"Merolli M, Francis JJ, Vallance P, Bennell KL, Malliaras P, Hinman RS.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2024 Mar 4;12:e55003. doi: 10.2196/55003.,Merolli M,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2024,2024/03/04,PMC10949126,,10.2196/55003,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions delivered through mobile apps are increasingly used in physiotherapy care. This may be because of the potential of apps to facilitate changes in behavior, which is central to the aims of care delivered by physiotherapists. A benefit of using apps is their ability to incorporate behavior change techniques (BCTs) that can optimize the effectiveness of physiotherapeutic interventions. Research continues to suggest that despite their importance, behavior change strategies are often missing in patient management. Evaluating mobile apps that physiotherapists can use to drive behavior change may inform clinical practice and potentially improve patient outcomes. Examining the quality of apps and exploring their key features that can support behavior change and physiotherapy care are important aspects of such an evaluation. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to describe the range of mobile apps in app stores that are intended for use by patients to support physiotherapy care. The secondary aims were to assess app quality, BCTs, and their behavior change potential. METHODS: A systematic review of mobile apps in app stores was undertaken. The Apple App Store and Google Play were searched using a 2-step search strategy, using terms relevant to the physiotherapy discipline. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied: apps had to be intended for use by patients and be self-contained (or stand-alone) without the requirement to be used in conjunction with a partner wearable device or another plugin. Included apps were coded for BCTs using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1. App quality was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale, and the App Behavior Change Scale was used to assess the app's potential to change behavior. RESULTS: In total, 1240 apps were screened, and 35 were included. Of these 35 apps, 22 (63%) were available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play platforms. In total, 24 (69%) were general in their focus (eg, not condition-specific), with the remaining 11 (31%) being more specific (eg, knee rehabilitation and pelvic floor training). The mean app quality score (Mobile App Rating Scale) was 3.7 (SD 0.4) of 5 (range 2.8-4.5). The mean number of BCTs identified per app was 8.5 (SD 3.6). BCTs most frequently included in the apps were instruction on how to perform a behavior (n=32), action planning (n=30), and self-monitoring of behavior (n=28). The mean behavior change potential score (App Behavior Change Scale) was 8.5 (SD 3.1) of 21 (range 3-15). CONCLUSIONS: Mobile apps available to support patient care received from a physiotherapist are of variable quality. Although they contain some BCTs, the potential for behavior change varied widely across apps. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/29047."

METHODS: Google Play and AppStore in the United States of America were queried and the quality of eligible mHealth apps was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from inception through June 2019. RESULTS: Of 324 mHealth apps found, 20 were eligible for inclusion; 10 focused on education, 7 offered tools to track patient-reported symptoms, 5 included interactive online communities, and 1 enabled emoji sharing. The reviewed apps scored poorly on the MARS quality scale with a mean score 2.3 (0.6) out of 5. Of 1147 studies identified in the literature review, 21 were eligible for inclusion; 11 studies (52.4%) focused on the development and use of mHealth for providing patient information, while only 2 (9.5%) were randomized trials of mHealth interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is growing interest in the development of mHealth technologies to support SLE patients, currently available tools are of poor quality and limited functionality, and the literature examining this area is sparse."
Exploring the Role of Web-Based Interventions in the Self-management of Dementia: Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis,"Lee AR, Gerritzen EV, McDermott O, Orrell M.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Jul 26;23(7):e26551. doi: 10.2196/26551.,Lee AR,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/07/26,PMC8367157,,10.2196/26551,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia has promoted a move toward equipping people with the skills required for greater self-management of the condition to enable a better quality of life. Self-management encompasses numerous skills, such as goal setting and decision making, which aim to improve an individual's physical and mental well-being when they live with long-term health conditions. Effective self-management may lead to increased well-being and quality of life. Reviews of web-based and app-based interventions have suggested that they have the potential to provide self-management support for people living with a range of conditions, including dementia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to explore the existing use of web-based or app-based interventions that facilitate or support self-management in dementia and discuss their effectiveness in promoting self-management and independence. METHODS: A total of 5 electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant articles published between January 2010 and March 2020. Included studies were appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program qualitative research checklist. A narrative synthesis framework was applied using tables and conceptual mapping to explore the relationships within and among studies. RESULTS: A total of 2561 articles were identified from the initial search, of which 11 (0.43%) met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis. These included 5 quantitative, 4 mixed methods, and 2 qualitative studies. All the included articles were of fair to high quality across the two appraisal measures. Interventions were delivered through a range of web-based and app-based technologies and targeted several self-management concepts. However, there was inconsistency regarding the domains, often affected by dementia, that were targeted by the interventions reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based and app-based interventions for dementia can be delivered through a range of means and can target different aspects of self-management. The small number of studies included in this review report positive outcomes that seem to support the use of these interventions for people living with dementia. However, there is a clear need for more high-quality research into this type of intervention delivery and for studies that use a much larger number of participants across the dementia spectrum. Future research should consider the barriers to and facilitators of intervention adoption highlighted in this review and whether interventions can encompass the physical, social, cognitive, and emotional domains affected by dementia."
Mobile health in the management of type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Wang X, Shu W, Du J, Du M, Wang P, Xue M, Zheng H, Jiang Y, Yin S, Liang D, Wang R, Hou L.",BMC Endocr Disord. 2019 Feb 13;19(1):21. doi: 10.1186/s12902-019-0347-6.,Wang X,BMC Endocr Disord,2019,2019/02/15,PMC6375163,,10.1186/s12902-019-0347-6,"BACKGROUND: As an insulin-dependent disease, type 1 diabetes requires paying close attention to the glycemic control. Studies have shown that mobile health (mHealth) can improve the management of chronic diseases. However, the effectiveness of mHealth in controlling the glycemic control remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis using the available literature reporting findings on mHealth interventions, which may improve the management of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of all studies in the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMbase databases that used mHealth (including mobile phones) in diabetes care and reported glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values as a measure of glycemic control. The fixed effects model was used for this meta-analysis. RESULTS: This study analyzed eight studies, which involved a total of 602 participants. In the meta-analysis, the fixed effects model showed a statistically significant decrease in the mean of HbA1c in the intervention group: - 0.25 (95% confidence interval: - 0.41, - 0.09; P = 0.003, I(2) = 12%). Subgroup analyses indicated that the patient's age, the type of intervention, and the duration of the intervention influenced blood glucose control. Funnel plots showed no publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile health interventions may be effective among patients with type 1 diabetes. A significant reduction in HbA1c levels was associated with adult age, the use of a mobile application, and the long-term duration of the intervention."
Evaluation of Mobile Health Technology Interventions for the Postdischarge Management of Patients With Head and Neck Cancer: Scoping Review,"Li Y, Chen W, Liang Y, Yang L, Hou L.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Oct 23;11:e49051. doi: 10.2196/49051.,Li Y,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/10/23,PMC10628684,,10.2196/49051,"BACKGROUND: Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) often experience various types and degrees of complications and functional impairment following surgery or radiotherapy. Consequently, these patients require extensive postdischarge rehabilitation, either at home or in the community. Numerous studies have shown the advantages of mobile Health (mHealth) technology in assisting patients with cancer with self-management and rehabilitation during the postdischarge period. However, few reviews have focused on the intervention, management, and evaluation of mHealth technology in postdischarge patients with HNC. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a scoping review of mHealth technology apps and interventions currently available to patients discharged from hospitals after receiving treatment for HNC. This study sought to identify and summarize the types and effectiveness of existing mHealth interventions as well as the differences in their outcome assessments. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases were used to identify studies with no publication time limits. The keywords ""mobile health technology"" and ""head and neck cancer"" were combined to address the main concepts of the research questions. RESULTS: Of the 1625 papers identified, 13 (0.8%) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies (n=8, 61.5%) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. These studies were conducted in 6 countries. The main aims of the mHealth interventions in these studies are as follows: (1) symptom monitoring and assessment, (2) rehabilitation training, (3) access to medical health information, (4) telehealth advisers, (5) peer communication and support, and (6) follow-up/review reminders. The outcome evaluations of the 13 included studies were grouped into 4 categories: (1) technology usability and patient satisfaction, (2) self-management of symptoms and patient-reported outcome-related indicators, (3) adherence, and (4) health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: A limited number of studies have investigated the use of mHealth technology in the postdischarge self-management of patients with HNC. The existing literature suggests that mHealth technology can effectively assist patients with HNC in self-management and postdischarge interventions. It plays an important role in addressing patients' health information needs, reducing both their somatic and psychological burdens, and improving their overall quality of life. Future research should prioritize conducting additional high-quality RCTs to evaluate the usability and analyze the cost-effectiveness of mHealth technology."
Assessing the Efficacy of Mobile Health Apps Using the Basic Principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Systematic Review,"Rathbone AL, Clarry L, Prescott J.",J Med Internet Res. 2017 Nov 28;19(11):e399. doi: 10.2196/jmir.8598.,Rathbone AL,J Med Internet Res,2017,2017/12/01,PMC5727354,,10.2196/jmir.8598,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in its basic principle has developed itself as a stand-alone, substantial method of therapy. With effective application in therapy for a range of mental health issues, the spread of CBT methods to Web-based therapy sources is evident. The development of mobile phone apps using CBT principles is increasing within the research area. Despite the move to Web-based methods of therapy, it is argued that these methods lack the same efficacy of face-to-face therapy sessions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess extent research findings with regard to the effectiveness of CBT-related mobile health (mHealth) apps. By assessing only studies employing a randomized controlled trial design, the review aimed to determine app efficacy within the highly regarded method of investigation. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several databases. Search results were filtered, and results were subject to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria because of the nature of the review. Where possible, analysis of effect size was calculated and results reported. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies investigating the effectiveness of mHealth CBT-related apps across a range of mental health issues were reviewed. Three studies used the app against a control group, and 5 studies used the app intervention against another form of treatment or intervention. A range of effect sizes were seen across all included studies (d=-0.13 to 1.83; 0.03-1.44), with the largest effects often being seen when comparing the data from pre- to posttest for the app engaged group. CONCLUSIONS: The studies reviewed support the use of mHealth apps containing CBT principles for a range of mental health issues. However, the effectiveness over longer time periods should be assessed. Researchers and professionals should seek to collaborate effectively when creating new apps to enhance their effectiveness as a treatment for the general public."
Technology-Supported Self-Guided Nutrition and Physical Activity Interventions for Adults With Cancer: Systematic Review,"Kiss N, Baguley BJ, Ball K, Daly RM, Fraser SF, Granger CL, Ugalde A.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Feb 12;7(2):e12281. doi: 10.2196/12281.,Kiss N,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/02/13,PMC6390188,,10.2196/12281,"BACKGROUND: Nutrition and physical activity interventions are important components of cancer care. With an increasing demand for services, there is a need to consider flexible, easily accessible, and tailored models of care while maintaining optimal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review describes and appraises the efficacy of technology-supported self-guided nutrition and physical activity interventions for people with cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of multiple databases from 1973 to July 2018 was conducted for randomized and nonrandomized trials investigating technology-supported self-guided nutrition and physical activity interventions. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Outcomes included behavioural, health-related, clinical, health service, or financial measures. RESULTS: Sixteen randomized controlled trials representing 2684 participants were included. Most studies were web-based interventions (n=9) and had a 12-week follow-up duration (n=8). Seven studies assessed dietary behaviour, of which two reported a significant benefit on diet quality or fruit and vegetable intake. Fifteen studies measured physical activity behaviour, of which eight studies reported a significant improvement in muscle strength and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Four of the nine studies assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) reported a significant improvement in global HRQoL or a domain subscale. A significant improvement in fatigue was found in four of six studies. Interpretation of findings was influenced by inadequate reporting of intervention description and compliance. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified short-term benefits of technology-supported self-guided interventions on the physical activity level and fatigue and some benefit on dietary behaviour and HRQoL in people with cancer. However, current literature demonstrates a lack of evidence for long-term benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42017080346; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=80346."
"Sustainability of Weight Loss Through Smartphone Apps: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis on Anthropometric, Metabolic, and Dietary Outcomes","Chew HSJ, Koh WL, Ng JSHY, Tan KK.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Sep 21;24(9):e40141. doi: 10.2196/40141.,Chew HSJ,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/09/21,PMC9536524,,10.2196/40141,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the long-term effects of weight management smartphone apps on various weight-related outcomes remains scarce. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aimed to examine the effects of smartphone apps on anthropometric, metabolic, and dietary outcomes at various time points. METHODS: Articles published from database inception to March 10, 2022 were searched, from 7 databases (Embase, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) using forward and backward citation tracking. All randomized controlled trials that reported weight change as an outcome in adults with overweight and obesity were included. We performed separate meta-analyses using random effects models for weight, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood glucose level, blood pressure, and total energy intake per day. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Based on our meta-analyses, weight loss was sustained between 3 and 12 months, with a peak of 2.18 kg at 3 months that tapered down to 1.63 kg at 12 months. We did not find significant benefits of weight loss on the secondary outcomes examined, except for a slight improvement in systolic blood pressure at 3 months. Most of the included studies covered app-based interventions that comprised of components beyond food logging, such as real-time diet and exercise self-monitoring, personalized and remote progress tracking, timely feedback provision, smart devices that synchronized activity and weight data to smartphones, and libraries of diet and physical activity ideas. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone weight loss apps are effective in initiating and sustaining weight loss between 3 and 12 months, but their effects are minimal in their current states. Future studies could consider the various aspects of the socioecological model. Conversational and dialectic components that simulate health coaches could be useful to enhance user engagement and outcome effectiveness.

Efficacy of an Internet-based intervention with self-applied exposure therapy in virtual reality for people with panic disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Schultz J, Baumeister A, Schmotz S, Moritz S, Jelinek L.",Trials. 2023 Aug 12;24(1):521. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07536-1.,Schultz J,Trials,2023,2023/08/12,PMC10422760,,10.1186/s13063-023-07536-1,"BACKGROUND: Due to several treatment barriers, many individuals with panic disorder do not receive evidence-based treatment. One promising option to narrow this treatment gap is Internet-based psychotherapy, which has been shown particularly effective in guided formats. Still, there remains room for improvement to make these digital therapies more accessible, cost-efficient, and aligned with best practices for in-person interventions (e.g., exposure). The smartphone app ""Invirto - Treatment for Anxiety"" offers digitally guided, evidence-based treatment of panic disorders including virtual reality (VR) for exposure therapy. The aim present study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and acceptance of Invirto in comparison to a care-as-usual (CAU) control group. METHODS: We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial with two conditions (intervention vs. CAU), three assessment times via online surveys (t0: baseline; t1: 3 months after baseline; t2: follow-up assessment 6 months after baseline), and a total of 128 participants with a clinical diagnosis of panic disorder (symptoms must be experienced >/= 1 year). Recruitment will take place via email, phone, and the study website. The primary outcome will be the change in anxiety symptoms as measured by Beck's Anxiety Inventory from t0 to t1. Secondary outcomes will be the change in anxiety symptoms (measured by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale, PAS; Questionnaire on panic-related Anxieties, Cognitions and Avoidance, ACA), depressive symptoms (measured by the Beck-Depression-Inventory, BDI-II), treatment satisfaction (measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, CSQ-8; Treatment Adherence Perception Questionnaire, TAPQ-adapt; Positive and Negative Effects of Psychotherapy Scale, PANEPS-I), psychological flexibility (measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II, AAQ-II), and dissociation during VR exposure (measured by an adapted version of the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire, PDEQ-adapt). Participants in the intervention group will receive access to the intervention (Invirto) right after t0, while the CAU group will receive access to Invirto after t1. We expect a larger change in both the primary and secondary outcomes from t0 to t1 in the intervention group in comparison to the CAU group. DISCUSSION: This study is one of the first to evaluate an Internet-based intervention for people with panic disorder that includes self-application of VR exposure therapy. The findings are expected to extend the body of knowledge about effective Internet-based treatment options for people with panic disorder. The empirical and clinical implications and the limitations of the study are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00027585 ( www.drks.de/drks_web/ ), date of registration: 13 January 2022."
Methods to Measure the Impact of mHealth Applications: Preliminary Results of a Scoping Review,"Holl F, Swoboda W.",Stud Health Technol Inform. 2018;251:285-288.,Holl F,Stud Health Technol Inform,2018,2018/07/04,,,,"Important requirements for mHealth, the availability of devices and network connectivity have dramatically improved in the past years globally. mHealth applications are being developed at a rapid pace. But a thorough impact assessment is not routinely performed. We performed a scoping review to compile an overview of evaluation methods used to assess mHealth applications. Preliminary results are reported here, and a full scoping review is in preparation. Qualitative measurement of user experience is common. A number of studies measured the impact of the mHealth intervention on clinical outcomes. Few measured usability and end-user experience. Assessment of the impact on treatment process was rare and evaluations of cost and cost-effectiveness analyses are rarely ever done. An evaluation framework for mHealth interventions that includes disease-appropriate clinical outcome measures, use experience measure but also an economic component in form of cost comparison of the intervention with the standard of care should be developed."
Smoking cessation with smartphone applications (SWAPP): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Lüscher J, Berli C, Schwaninger P, Scholz U.",BMC Public Health. 2019 Oct 29;19(1):1400. doi: 10.1186/s12889-019-7723-z.,Lüscher J,BMC Public Health,2019,2019/10/31,PMC6819348,,10.1186/s12889-019-7723-z,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking remains one of the biggest public health threats. Smartphone apps offer new promising opportunities for supporting smoking cessation in real-time. The social context of smokers has, however, been neglected in smartphone apps promoting smoking cessation. This randomized controlled trial investigates the effectiveness of a smartphone app in which smokers quit smoking with the help of a social network member. METHODS: This protocol describes the design of a single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, intensive longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Participants of this study are adult smokers who smoke at least one cigarette per day and intend to quit smoking at a self-set quit date. Blocking as means of group-balanced randomization is used to allocate participants to intervention or control conditions. Both intervention and control group use a smartphone-compatible device for measuring their daily smoking behavior objectively via exhaled carbon monoxide. In addition, the intervention group is instructed to use the SmokeFree Buddy app, a multicomponent app that also facilitates smoking-cessation specific social support from a buddy over a smartphone application. All participants fill out a baseline diary for three consecutive days and are invited to the lab for a background assessment. They subsequently participate in an end-of-day diary phase from 7 days before and until 20 days after a self-set quit date. Six months after the self-set quit date a follow-up diary for three consecutive days takes place. The primary outcome measures are daily self-reported and objectively-assessed smoking abstinence and secondary outcome measures are daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked. DISCUSSION: This is the first study examining the effectiveness of a smoking cessation mobile intervention using the SmokeFree Buddy app compared to a control group in a real-life setting around a self-set quit date using a portable objective measure to assess smoking abstinence. Opportunities and challenges with running studies with smoking participants and certain design-related decisions are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered on 04/04/2018 at ISRCTNregistry: ISRCTN11154315 ."
The Comparative Effectiveness of Mobile Phone Interventions in Improving Health Outcomes: Meta-Analytic Review,"Yang Q, Van Stee SK.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Apr 3;7(4):e11244. doi: 10.2196/11244.,Yang Q,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/04/04,PMC6468337,,10.2196/11244,"BACKGROUND: As mobile technology continues expanding, researchers have been using mobile phones to conduct health interventions (mobile health-mHealth-interventions). The multiple features of mobile phones offer great opportunities to disseminate large-scale, cost-efficient, and tailored messages to participants. However, the interventions to date have shown mixed results, with a large variance of effect sizes (Cohen d=-0.62 to 1.65). OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to generate cumulative knowledge that informs mHealth intervention research. The aims were twofold: (1) to calculate an overall effect magnitude for mHealth interventions compared with alternative interventions or conditions, and (2) to analyze potential moderators of mHealth interventions' comparative efficacy. METHODS: Comprehensive searches of the Communication & Mass Media Complete, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Academic Search Premier, PubMed and MEDLINE databases were conducted to identify potentially eligible studies in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and dissertations and theses. Search queries were formulated using a combination of search terms: ""intervention"" (Title or Abstract) AND ""health"" (Title or Abstract) AND ""*phone*"" OR ""black-berr*"" (OR mHealth OR ""application*"" OR app* OR mobile OR cellular OR ""short messag*"" OR palm* OR iPhone* OR MP3* OR MP4* OR iPod*) (Title or Abstract). Cohen d was computed as the basic unit of analysis, and the variance-weighted analysis was implemented to compute the overall effect size under a random-effects model. Analysis of variance-like and meta-regression models were conducted to analyze categorical and continuous moderators, respectively. RESULTS: The search resulted in 3424 potential studies, the abstracts (and full text, as necessary) of which were reviewed for relevance. Studies were screened in multiple stages using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, and citations were evaluated for inclusion of qualified studies. A total of 64 studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Results showed that mHealth interventions are relatively more effective than comparison interventions or conditions, with a small but significant overall weighted effect size (Cohen d=0.31). In addition, the effects of interventions are moderated by theoretical paradigm, 3 engagement types (ie, changing personal environment, reinforcement tracking, social presentation), mobile use type, intervention channel, and length of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date that examined the overall effectiveness of mHealth interventions across health topics and is the first study that statistically tested moderators. Our findings not only shed light on intervention design using mobile phones, but also provide new directions for research in health communication and promotion using new media. Future research scholarship is needed to examine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions across various health issues, especially those that have not yet been investigated (eg, substance use, sexual health), engaging participants using social features on mobile phones, and designing tailored mHealth interventions for diverse subpopulations to maximize effects."
Influences on the Uptake of and Engagement With Health and Well-Being Smartphone Apps: Systematic Review,"Szinay D, Jones A, Chadborn T, Brown J, Naughton F.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 May 29;22(5):e17572. doi: 10.2196/17572.,Szinay D,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/04/30,PMC7293059,,10.2196/17572,"BACKGROUND: The public health impact of health and well-being digital interventions is dependent upon sufficient real-world uptake and engagement. Uptake is currently largely dependent on popularity indicators (eg, ranking and user ratings on app stores), which may not correspond with effectiveness, and rapid disengagement is common. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify factors that influence uptake and engagement with health and well-being apps to inform new approaches that promote the effective use of such tools. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to understand what is known about influences on the uptake of and engagement with health and well-being smartphone apps among adults. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies. Studies conducted on adults were included if they focused on health and well-being smartphone apps reporting on uptake and engagement behavior. Studies identified through a systematic search in Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, or MEDLARS Online (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsychINFO, Scopus, Cochrane library databases, DataBase systems and Logic Programming (DBLP), and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital library were screened, with a proportion screened independently by 2 authors. Data synthesis and interpretation were undertaken using a deductive iterative process. External validity checking was undertaken by an independent researcher. A narrative synthesis of the findings was structured around the components of the capability, opportunity, motivation, behavior change model and the theoretical domains framework (TDF). RESULTS: Of the 7640 identified studies, 41 were included in the review. Factors related to uptake (U), engagement (E), or both (B) were identified. Under capability, the main factors identified were app literacy skills (B), app awareness (U), available user guidance (B), health information (E), statistical information on progress (E), well-designed reminders (E), features to reduce cognitive load (E), and self-monitoring features (E). Availability at low cost (U), positive tone, and personalization (E) were identified as physical opportunity factors, whereas recommendations for health and well-being apps (U), embedded health professional support (E), and social networking (E) possibilities were social opportunity factors. Finally, the motivation factors included positive feedback (E), available rewards (E), goal setting (E), and the perceived utility of the app (E). CONCLUSIONS: Across a wide range of populations and behaviors, 26 factors relating to capability, opportunity, and motivation appear to influence the uptake of and engagement with health and well-being smartphone apps. Our recommendations may help app developers, health app portal developers, and policy makers in the optimization of health and well-being apps."
A smartphone application for treating depressive symptoms: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Deady M, Johnston DA, Glozier N, Milne D, Choi I, Mackinnon A, Mykletun A, Calvo RA, Gayed A, Bryant R, Christensen H, Harvey SB.",BMC Psychiatry. 2018 Jun 1;18(1):166. doi: 10.1186/s12888-018-1752-5.,Deady M,BMC Psychiatry,2018,2018/06/03,PMC5984798,,10.1186/s12888-018-1752-5,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a commonly occurring disorder linked to diminished role functioning and quality of life. The development of treatments that overcome barriers to accessing treatment remains an important area of clinical research as most people delay or do not receive treatment at an appropriate time. The workplace is an ideal setting to roll-out an intervention, particularly given the substantial psychological benefits associated with remaining in the workforce. Mobile health (mhealth) interventions utilising smartphone applications (apps) offer novel solutions to disseminating evidence based programs, however few apps have undergone rigorous testing. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone app designed to treat depressive symptoms in workers. METHODS: The present study is a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT), comparing the effectiveness of the intervention to that of an attention control. The primary outcome measured will be reduced depressive symptoms at 3 months. Secondary outcomes such as wellbeing and work performance will also be measured. Employees from a range of industries will be recruited via a mixture of targeted social media advertising and Industry partners. Participants will be included if they present with likely current depression at baseline. Following baseline assessment (administered within the app), participants will be randomised to receive one of two versions of the Headgear application: 1) Intervention (a 30-day mental health intervention focusing on behavioural activation and mindfulness), or 2) attention control app (mood monitoring for 30 days). Participants will be blinded to their allocation. Analyses will be conducted within an intention to treat framework using mixed modelling. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide valuable information about the effectiveness of mhealth interventions in the treatment of depressive symptoms in a workplace context.

"Patient-Centered eHealth Interventions for Children, Adolescents, and Adults With Sickle Cell Disease: Systematic Review","Badawy SM, Cronin RM, Hankins J, Crosby L, DeBaun M, Thompson AA, Shah N.",J Med Internet Res. 2018 Jul 19;20(7):e10940. doi: 10.2196/10940.,Badawy SM,J Med Internet Res,2018,2018/07/21,PMC6072976,,10.2196/10940,"BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects over 100,000 Americans. Sickle cell disease-related complications lead to significant morbidity and early death. Evidence supporting the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of self-management electronic health (eHealth) interventions in chronic diseases is growing; however, the evidence is unclear in sickle cell disease. OBJECTIVE: We systematically evaluated the most recent evidence in the literature to (1) review the different types of technological tools used for self-management of sickle cell disease, (2) discover and describe what self-management activities these tools were used for, and (3) assess the efficacy of these technologies in self-management. METHODS: We reviewed literature published between 1995 and 2016 with no language limits. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and other sources. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, assessed full-text articles, and extracted data from articles that met inclusion criteria. Eligible studies were original research articles that included texting, mobile phone-based apps, or other eHealth interventions designed to improve self-management in pediatric and adult patients with sickle cell disease. RESULTS: Of 1680 citations, 16 articles met all predefined criteria with a total of 747 study participants. Interventions were text messaging (4/16, 25%), native mobile apps (3/16, 19%), Web-based apps (5/16, 31%), mobile directly observed therapy (2/16, 13%), internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (2/16, 13%), electronic pill bottle (1/16, 6%), or interactive gamification (2/16, 13%). Interventions targeted monitoring or improvement of medication adherence (5/16, 31%); self-management, pain reporting, and symptom reporting (7/16, 44%); stress, coping, sleep, and daily activities reporting (4/16, 25%); cognitive training for memory (1/16, 6%); sickle cell disease and reproductive health knowledge (5/16, 31%); cognitive behavioral therapy (2/16, 13%); and guided relaxation interventions (1/16, 6%). Most studies (11/16, 69%) included older children or adolescents (mean or median age 10-17 years; 11/16, 69%) and 5 included young adults (>/=18 years old) (5/16, 31%). Sample size ranged from 11 to 236, with a median of 21 per study: <20 in 6 (38%), >/=20 to <50 in 6 (38%), and >50 participants in 4 studies (25%). Most reported improvement in self-management-related outcomes (15/16, 94%), as well as high satisfaction and acceptability of different study interventions (10/16, 63%). CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review identified eHealth interventions measuring a variety of outcomes, which showed improvement in multiple components of self-management of sickle cell disease. Despite the promising feasibility and acceptability of eHealth interventions in improving self-management of sickle cell disease, the evidence overall is modest. Future eHealth intervention studies are needed to evaluate their efficacy, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness in promoting self-management in patients with sickle cell disease using rigorous methods and theoretical frameworks with clearly defined clinical outcomes."
Development of a digital biomarker and intervention for subclinical depression: study protocol for a longitudinal waitlist control study,"Teepe GW, Lukic YX, Kleim B, Jacobson NC, Schneider F, Santhanam P, Fleisch E, Kowatsch T.",BMC Psychol. 2023 Jun 22;11(1):186. doi: 10.1186/s40359-023-01215-1.,Teepe GW,BMC Psychol,2023,2023/06/22,PMC10288725,,10.1186/s40359-023-01215-1,"BACKGROUND: Depression remains a global health problem, with its prevalence rising worldwide. Digital biomarkers are increasingly investigated to initiate and tailor scalable interventions targeting depression. Due to the steady influx of new cases, focusing on treatment alone will not suffice; academics and practitioners need to focus on the prevention of depression (i.e., addressing subclinical depression). AIM: With our study, we aim to (i) develop digital biomarkers for subclinical symptoms of depression, (ii) develop digital biomarkers for severity of subclinical depression, and (iii) investigate the efficacy of a digital intervention in reducing symptoms and severity of subclinical depression. METHOD: Participants will interact with the digital intervention BEDDA consisting of a scripted conversational agent, the slow-paced breathing training Breeze, and actionable advice for different symptoms. The intervention comprises 30 daily interactions to be completed in less than 45 days. We will collect self-reports regarding mood, agitation, anhedonia (proximal outcomes; first objective), self-reports regarding depression severity (primary distal outcome; second and third objective), anxiety severity (secondary distal outcome; second and third objective), stress (secondary distal outcome; second and third objective), voice, and breathing. A subsample of 25% of the participants will use smartwatches to record physiological data (e.g., heart-rate, heart-rate variability), which will be used in the analyses for all three objectives. DISCUSSION: Digital voice- and breathing-based biomarkers may improve diagnosis, prevention, and care by enabling an unobtrusive and either complementary or alternative assessment to self-reports. Furthermore, our results may advance our understanding of underlying psychophysiological changes in subclinical depression. Our study also provides further evidence regarding the efficacy of standalone digital health interventions to prevent depression. Trial registration Ethics approval was provided by the Ethics Commission of ETH Zurich (EK-2022-N-31) and the study was registered in the ISRCTN registry (Reference number: ISRCTN38841716, Submission date: 20/08/2022)."
Effectiveness of mHealth interventions for patients with diabetes: An overview of systematic reviews,"Kitsiou S, Paré G, Jaana M, Gerber B.",PLoS One. 2017 Mar 1;12(3):e0173160. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173160. eCollection 2017.,Kitsiou S,PLoS One,2017,2017/03/02,PMC5332111,,10.1371/journal.pone.0173160,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a common chronic disease that places an unprecedented strain on health care systems worldwide. Mobile health technologies such as smartphones, mobile applications, and wearable devices, known as mHealth, offer significant and innovative opportunities for improving patient to provider communication and self-management of diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this overview is to critically appraise and consolidate evidence from multiple systematic reviews on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for patients with diabetes to inform policy makers, practitioners, and researchers. METHODS: A comprehensive search on multiple databases was performed to identify relevant systematic reviews published between January 1996 and December 2015. Two authors independently selected reviews, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of included reviews using AMSTAR. RESULTS: Fifteen systematic reviews published between 2008 and 2014 were eligible for inclusion. The quality of the reviews varied considerably and most of them had important methodological limitations. Focusing on systematic reviews that offered the most direct evidence, this overview demonstrates that on average, mHealth interventions improve glycemic control (HbA1c) compared to standard care or other non-mHealth approaches by as much as 0.8% for patients with type 2 diabetes and 0.3% for patients with type 1 diabetes, at least in the short-term (</=12 months). However, limitations in the overall quality of evidence suggest that further research will likely have an important impact in these estimates of effect. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with clinically relevant improvements, particularly with respect to patients with type 2 diabetes. Similar to home telemonitoring, mHealth interventions represent a promising approach for self-management of diabetes."
Smartphone-Delivered Ecological Momentary Interventions Based on Ecological Momentary Assessments to Promote Health Behaviors: Systematic Review and Adapted Checklist for Reporting Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention Studies,"Dao KP, De Cocker K, Tong HL, Kocaballi AB, Chow C, Laranjo L.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2021 Nov 19;9(11):e22890. doi: 10.2196/22890.,Dao KP,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2021,2021/11/22,PMC8663593,,10.2196/22890,"BACKGROUND: Healthy behaviors are crucial for maintaining a person's health and well-being. The effects of health behavior interventions are mediated by individual and contextual factors that vary over time. Recently emerging smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) can use real-time user reports (ecological momentary assessments [EMAs]) to trigger appropriate support when needed in daily life. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to assess the characteristics of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs in relation to their effects on health behaviors, user engagement, and user perspectives. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL in June 2019 and updated the search in March 2020. We included experimental studies that incorporated EMIs based on EMAs delivered through smartphone apps to promote health behaviors in any health domain. Studies were independently screened. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. We performed a narrative synthesis of intervention effects, user perspectives and engagement, and intervention design and characteristics. Quality appraisal was conducted for all included studies. RESULTS: We included 19 papers describing 17 unique studies and comprising 652 participants. Most studies were quasi-experimental (13/17, 76%), had small sample sizes, and great heterogeneity in intervention designs and measurements. EMIs were most popular in the mental health domain (8/17, 47%), followed by substance abuse (3/17, 18%), diet, weight loss, physical activity (4/17, 24%), and smoking (2/17, 12%). Of the 17 studies, the 4 (24%) included randomized controlled trials reported nonstatistically significant effects on health behaviors, and 4 (24%) quasi-experimental studies reported statistically significant pre-post improvements in self-reported primary outcomes, namely depressive (P<.001) and psychotic symptoms (P=.03), drinking frequency (P<.001), and eating patterns (P=.01). EMA was commonly used to capture subjective experiences as well as behaviors, whereas sensors were rarely used. Generally, users perceived EMIs to be helpful. Common suggestions for improvement included enhancing personalization, multimedia and interactive capabilities (eg, voice recording), and lowering the EMA reporting burden. EMI and EMA components were rarely reported and were not described in a standardized manner across studies, hampering progress in this field. A reporting checklist was developed to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of findings and enhance the transparency and replicability of future studies using EMAs and EMIs. CONCLUSIONS: The use of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs to promote behavior change is an emerging area of research, with few studies evaluating efficacy. Such interventions could present an opportunity to enhance health but need further assessment in larger participant cohorts and well-designed evaluations following reporting checklists. Future research should explore combining self-reported EMAs of subjective experiences with objective data passively collected via sensors to promote personalization while minimizing user burden, as well as explore different EMA data collection methods (eg, chatbots).

Methods and Evaluation Criteria for Apps and Digital Interventions for Diabetes Self-Management: Systematic Review,"Larbi D, Randine P, Årsand E, Antypas K, Bradway M, Gabarron E.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Jul 6;22(7):e18480. doi: 10.2196/18480.,Larbi D,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/07/07,PMC7381260,,10.2196/18480,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that apps and digital interventions have a positive impact on diabetes self-management. Standard self-management for patients with diabetes could therefore be supplemented by apps and digital interventions to increase patients' skills. Several initiatives, models, and frameworks suggest how health apps and digital interventions could be evaluated, but there are few standards for this. And although there are many methods for evaluating apps and digital interventions, a more specific approach might be needed for assessing digital diabetes self-management interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to identify which methods and criteria are used to evaluate apps and digital interventions for diabetes self-management, and to describe how patients were involved in these evaluations. METHODS: We searched CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for articles published from 2015 that referred to the evaluation of apps and digital interventions for diabetes self-management and involved patients in the evaluation. We then conducted a narrative qualitative synthesis of the findings, structured around the included studies' quality, methods of evaluation, and evaluation criteria. RESULTS: Of 1681 articles identified, 31 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 7 articles were considered of high confidence in the evidence. Apps were the most commonly used platform for diabetes self-management (18/31, 58%), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) was the targeted health condition most studies focused on (12/31, 38%). Questionnaires, interviews, and user-group meetings were the most common methods of evaluation. Furthermore, the most evaluated criteria for apps and digital diabetes self-management interventions were cognitive impact, clinical impact, and usability. Feasibility and security and privacy were not evaluated by studies considered of high confidence in the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: There were few studies with high confidence in the evidence that involved patients in the evaluation of apps and digital interventions for diabetes self-management. Additional evaluation criteria, such as sustainability and interoperability, should be focused on more in future studies to provide a better understanding of the effects and potential of apps and digital interventions for diabetes self-management."
Mobile Health Application-Based Interventions to Improve Self-management of Chemotherapy-Related Symptoms Among People with Breast Cancer Who Are Undergoing Chemotherapy: A Systematic Review,"Shi N, Wong AKC, Wong FKY, Sha L.",Oncologist. 2023 Apr 6;28(4):e175-e182. doi: 10.1093/oncolo/oyac267.,Shi N,Oncologist,2023,2023/02/21,PMC10078896,,10.1093/oncolo/oyac267,"BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been an increasing number of studies on using mobile health (mHealth) to support the symptom self-management of patients with breast cancer (BC). However, the components of such programs remain unexplored. This systematic review aimed to identify the components of existing mHealth app-based interventions for patients with BC who are undergoing chemotherapy and to uncover self-efficacy enhancement elements from among them. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted for randomized controlled trials published from 2010 to 2021. Two strategies were used to assess the mHealth apps: The Omaha System, a structured classification system for patient care, and Bandura's self-efficacy theory, which assesses sources of influence that determine an individual's confidence in being able to manage a problem. Intervention components identified in the studies were grouped under the 4 domains of the intervention scheme of the Omaha System. Four hierarchical sources of self-efficacy enhancement elements were extracted from the studies using Bandura's self-efficacy theory. RESULTS: The search uncovered 1,668 records. Full-text screening was conducted on 44 articles, and 5 randomized controlled trials (n = 537 participants) were included. Self-monitoring under the domain of ""Treatments and procedure"" was the most frequently used mHealth intervention for improving symptom self-management in patients with BC undergoing chemotherapy. Most mHealth apps used various ""mastery experience"" strategies including reminders, self-care advice, videos, and learning forums. CONCLUSION: Self-monitoring was commonly utilized in mHealth-based interventions for patients with BC undergoing chemotherapy. Our survey uncovered evident variation in strategies to support self-management of symptoms and standardized reporting is required. More evidence is required to make conclusive recommendations related to mHealth tools for BC chemotherapy self-management."
An internet-based intervention for people with psychosis (EviBaS): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Rüegg N, Moritz S, Berger T, Lüdtke T, Westermann S.",BMC Psychiatry. 2018 Apr 13;18(1):102. doi: 10.1186/s12888-018-1644-8.,Rüegg N,BMC Psychiatry,2018,2018/04/15,PMC5899332,,10.1186/s12888-018-1644-8,"BACKGROUND: Evidence shows that internet-based self-help interventions are effective in reducing symptoms for a wide range of mental disorders. To date, online interventions treating psychotic disorders have been scarce, even though psychosis is among the most burdensome disorders worldwide. Furthermore, the implementation of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for psychosis in routine health care is challenging. Internet-based interventions could narrow this treatment gap. Thus, a comprehensive CBT-based online self-help intervention for people with psychosis has been developed. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention compared with a waiting list control group. METHODS: The intervention includes modules on delusion, voice hearing, social competence, mindfulness, and seven other domains. Participants are guided through the program by a personal moderator. Usage can be amended by an optional smartphone app. In this randomized controlled trial, participants are allocated to a waiting list or an intervention of eight weeks. Change in positive psychotic symptoms of both groups will be compared (primary outcome) and predictors of treatment effects will be assessed. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this project is one of the first large-scale investigations of an internet-based intervention for people with psychosis. It may thus be a further step to broaden treatment options for people suffering from this disorder. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02974400 (clinicaltrials.gov), date of registration: November 28th 2016."

This research extends the scope of previous systematic reviews by including 2 subgroup analyses based on nonmobile interventions that accompanied smartphone use and human-based versus passive behavioral interventions. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of smartphone apps on weight loss in the context of other interventions combined with app use. The secondary objective is to measure the impact of different mobile app features on weight loss and mobile app adherence. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies after an extensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EBSCO databases from inception to January 31, 2022. Gray literature, such as abstracts and conference proceedings, was included. Working independently, 2 investigators extracted the data from the articles, resolving disagreements by consensus. All randomized controlled trials that used smartphone apps in at least 1 arm for weight loss were included. The weight loss outcome was the change in weight from baseline to the 3- and 6-month periods for each arm. Net change estimates were pooled across the studies using random-effects models to compare the intervention group with the control group. The risk of bias was assessed independently by 2 authors using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials. RESULTS: Overall, 34 studies were included that evaluated the use of a smartphone app in at least 1 arm. Compared with controls, the use of a smartphone app-based intervention showed a significant weight loss of -1.99 kg (95% CI -2.19 to -1.79 kg; I(2)=81%) at 3 months and -2.80 kg (95% CI -3.03 to -2.56 kg; I(2)=91%) at 6 months. In the subgroup analysis, based on the various intervention components that were added to the mobile app, the combination of the mobile app, tracker, and behavioral interventions showed a statistically significant weight loss of -2.09 kg (95% CI -2.32 to -1.86 kg; I(2)=91%) and -3.77 kg (95% CI -4.05 to -3.49 kg; I(2)=90%) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. When a behavioral intervention was present, only the combination of the mobile app with intensive behavior coaching or feedback by a human coach showed a statistically significant weight loss of -2.03 kg (95% CI -2.80 to -1.26 kg; I(2)=83%) and -2.63 kg (95% CI -2.97 to -2.29 kg; I(2)=91%) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Neither the type nor the number of mobile app features was associated with weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone apps have a role in weight loss management. Nevertheless, the human-based behavioral component remained key to higher weight loss results."
The Effectiveness of Smartphone Apps for Lifestyle Improvement in Noncommunicable Diseases: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses,"Lunde P, Nilsson BB, Bergland A, Kværner KJ, Bye A.",J Med Internet Res. 2018 May 4;20(5):e162. doi: 10.2196/jmir.9751.,Lunde P,J Med Internet Res,2018,2018/05/06,PMC5960039,,10.2196/jmir.9751,"BACKGROUND: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 70% of all deaths in a year globally. The four main NCDs are cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic pulmonary diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Fifty percent of persons with NCD do not adhere to prescribed treatment; in fact, adherence to lifestyle interventions is especially considered as a major challenge. Smartphone apps permit structured monitoring of health parameters, as well as the opportunity to receive feedback. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review and assess the effectiveness of app-based interventions, lasting at least 3 months, to promote lifestyle changes in patients with NCDs. METHODS: In February 2017, a literature search in five databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Academic Research Premier, and Cochrane Reviews and Trials) was conducted. Inclusion criteria was quantitative study designs including randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that included patients aged 18 years and older diagnosed with any of the four main NCDs. Lifestyle outcomes were physical activity, physical fitness, modification of dietary habits, and quality of life. All included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration;s risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were conducted for one of the outcomes (glycated hemoglobin, HbA(1c)) by using the estimate of effect of mean post treatment with SD or CI. Heterogeneity was tested using the I(2) test. All studies included in the meta-analyses were graded. RESULTS: Of the 1588 records examined, 9 met the predefined criteria. Seven studies included diabetes patients only, one study included heart patients only, and another study included both diabetes and heart patients. Statistical significant effect was shown in HbA(1c) in 5 of 8 studies, as well in body weight in one of 5 studies and in waist circumference in one of 3 studies evaluating these outcomes. Seven of the included studies were included in the meta-analyses and demonstrated significantly overall effect on HbA(1c) on a short term (3-6 months; P=.02) with low heterogeneity (I(2)=41%). In the long term (10-12 months), the overall effect on HbA(1c) was statistical significant (P=.009) and without heterogeneity (I(2)=0%). The quality of evidence according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation was low for short term and moderate for long term. CONCLUSIONS: Our review demonstrated limited research of the use of smartphone apps for NCDs other than diabetes with a follow-up of at least 3 months. For diabetes, the use of apps seems to improve lifestyle factors, especially to decrease HbA(1c). More research with long-term follow-up should be performed to assess the effect of smartphone apps for NCDs other than diabetes."
Just-in-Time Adaptive Mechanisms of Popular Mobile Apps for Individuals With Depression: Systematic App Search and Literature Review,"Teepe GW, Da Fonseca A, Kleim B, Jacobson NC, Salamanca Sanabria A, Tudor Car L, Fleisch E, Kowatsch T.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Sep 28;23(9):e29412. doi: 10.2196/29412.,Teepe GW,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/07/26,PMC8512178,,10.2196/29412,"BACKGROUND: The number of smartphone apps that focus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of depression is increasing. A promising approach to increase the effectiveness of the apps while reducing the individual's burden is the use of just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) mechanisms. JITAIs are designed to improve the effectiveness of the intervention and reduce the burden on the person using the intervention by providing the right type of support at the right time. The right type of support and the right time are determined by measuring the state of vulnerability and the state of receptivity, respectively. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to systematically assess the use of JITAI mechanisms in popular apps for individuals with depression. METHODS: We systematically searched for apps addressing depression in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, as well as in curated lists from the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, the United Kingdom National Health Service, and the American Psychological Association in August 2020. The relevant apps were ranked according to the number of reviews (Apple App Store) or downloads (Google Play Store). For each app, 2 authors separately reviewed all publications concerning the app found within scientific databases (PubMed, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM Portal, and Science Direct), publications cited on the app's website, information on the app's website, and the app itself. All types of measurements (eg, open questions, closed questions, and device analytics) found in the apps were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS: None of the 28 reviewed apps used JITAI mechanisms to tailor content to situations, states, or individuals. Of the 28 apps, 3 (11%) did not use any measurements, 20 (71%) exclusively used self-reports that were insufficient to leverage the full potential of the JITAIs, and the 5 (18%) apps using self-reports and passive measurements used them as progress or task indicators only. Although 34% (23/68) of the reviewed publications investigated the effectiveness of the apps and 21% (14/68) investigated their efficacy, no publication mentioned or evaluated JITAI mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Promising JITAI mechanisms have not yet been translated into mainstream depression apps. Although the wide range of passive measurements available from smartphones were rarely used, self-reported outcomes were used by 71% (20/28) of the apps. However, in both cases, the measured outcomes were not used to tailor content and timing along a state of vulnerability or receptivity. Owing to this lack of tailoring to individual, state, or situation, we argue that the apps cannot be considered JITAIs. The lack of publications investigating whether JITAI mechanisms lead to an increase in the effectiveness or efficacy of the apps highlights the need for further research, especially in real-world apps."
Behaviour change techniques in cardiovascular disease smartphone apps to improve physical activity and sedentary behaviour: Systematic review and meta-regression,"Patterson K, Davey R, Keegan R, Kunstler B, Woodward A, Freene N.",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2022 Jul 7;19(1):81. doi: 10.1186/s12966-022-01319-8.,Patterson K,Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,2022,2022/07/07,PMC9261070,,10.1186/s12966-022-01319-8,"BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps are increasingly used to deliver physical activity and sedentary behaviour interventions for people with cardiovascular disease. However, the active components of these interventions which aim to change behaviours are unclear. AIMS: To identify behaviour change techniques used in smartphone app interventions for improving physical activity and sedentary behaviour in people with cardiovascular disease. Secondly, to investigate the association of the identified techniques on improving these behaviours. METHODS: Six databases (Medline, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Sports Discus, EMBASE) were searched from 2007 to October 2020. Eligible studies used a smartphone app intervention for people with cardiovascular disease and reported a physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour outcome. The behaviour change techniques used within the apps for physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour were coded using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy (v1). The association of behaviour change techniques on physical activity outcomes were explored through meta-regression. RESULTS: Forty behaviour change techniques were identified across the 19 included app-based interventions. Only two studies reported the behaviour change techniques used to target sedentary behaviour change. The most frequently used techniques for sedentary behaviour and physical activity were habit reversal and self-monitoring of behaviour respectively. In univariable analyses, action planning (beta =0.42, 90%CrI 0.07-0.78) and graded tasks (beta =0.33, 90%CrI -0.04-0.67) each had medium positive associations with increasing physical activity. Participants in interventions that used either self-monitoring outcome(s) of behaviour (i.e. outcomes other than physical activity) (beta = - 0.47, 90%CrI -0.79--0.16), biofeedback (beta = - 0.47, 90%CrI -0.81--0.15) and information about health consequences (beta = - 0.42, 90%CrI -0.74--0.07) as behaviour change techniques, appeared to do less physical activity. In the multivariable model, these predictors were not clearly removed from zero. CONCLUSION: The behaviour change techniques action planning and graded tasks are good candidates for causal testing in future experimental smartphone app designs."
"Mobile Apps to Reduce Tobacco, Alcohol, and Illicit Drug Use: Systematic Review of the First Decade","Staiger PK, O'Donnell R, Liknaitzky P, Bush R, Milward J.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Nov 24;22(11):e17156. doi: 10.2196/17156.,Staiger PK,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/11/24,PMC7723745,,10.2196/17156,"BACKGROUND: Mobile apps for problematic substance use have the potential to bypass common barriers to treatment seeking. Ten years following the release of the first app targeting problematic tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, their effectiveness, use, and acceptability remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review of trials evaluating mobile app interventions for problematic tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use. METHODS: The review was conducted according to recommended guidelines. Relevant databases were searched, and articles were included if the mobile app study was a controlled intervention trial and reported alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug consumption as outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies met eligibility criteria across a range of substances: alcohol (n=11), tobacco (n=6), alcohol and tobacco (n=1), illicit drugs (n=1), and illicit drugs and alcohol (n=1). Samples included the general community, university students, and clinical patients. The analyzed intervention sample sizes ranged from 22 to 14,228, and content was considerably diverse, from simple stand-alone apps delivering self-monitoring or psychoeducation to multicomponent apps with interactive features and audio content, or used as adjuncts alongside face-to-face treatment. Intervention duration ranged from 1 to 35 weeks, with notifications ranging from none to multiple times per day. A total of 6 of the 20 app interventions reported significant reductions in substance use at post or follow-up compared with a comparison condition, with small to moderate effect sizes. Furthermore, two other app interventions reported significant reductions during the intervention but not at post treatment, and a third reported a significant interaction of two app intervention components. CONCLUSIONS: Although most app interventions were associated with reductions in problematic substance use, less than one-third were significantly better than the comparison conditions at post treatment. A total of 5 out of the 6 apps that reported intervention effects targeted alcohol (of those, one targeted alcohol and illicit drugs and another alcohol and tobacco) and 1 targeted tobacco. Moreover, 3 out of 6 apps included feedback (eg, personalized) and 2 had high risk of bias, 1 some risk, and 3 low risk. All 6 apps included interventions of 6 weeks or longer. Common study limitations were small sample sizes; risk of bias; lack of relevant details; and, in some cases, poorly balanced comparison conditions. Appropriately powered trials are required to understand which app interventions are most effective, length of engagement required, and subgroups most likely to benefit. In sum, evidence to date for the effectiveness of apps targeting problematic substance use is not compelling, although the heterogeneous comparison conditions and trial designs across studies limit the ability to compare efficacy between apps. We discuss potential approaches that can help ascertain whether the promise of mobile app interventions for problematic substance use can be fulfilled."
Applying the Electronic Health Literacy Lens: Systematic Review of Electronic Health Interventions Targeted at Socially Disadvantaged Groups,"Cheng C, Beauchamp A, Elsworth GR, Osborne RH.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Aug 13;22(8):e18476. doi: 10.2196/18476.,Cheng C,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/08/14,PMC7453328,,10.2196/18476,"BACKGROUND: Electronic health (eHealth) has the potential to improve health outcomes. However, eHealth systems need to match the eHealth literacy needs of users to be equitably adopted. Socially disadvantaged groups have lower access and skills to use technologies and are at risk of being digitally marginalized, leading to the potential widening of health disparities. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to explore the role of eHealth literacy and user involvement in developing eHealth interventions targeted at socially disadvantaged groups. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across 10 databases for eHealth interventions targeted at older adults, ethnic minority groups, low-income groups, low-literacy groups, and rural communities. The eHealth Literacy Framework was used to examine the eHealth literacy components of reviewed interventions. The results were analyzed using narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies reporting on the results of 48 interventions were evaluated. Most studies were targeted at older adults and ethnic minorities, with only 2 studies focusing on low-literacy groups. eHealth literacy was not considered in the development of any of the studies, and no eHealth literacy assessment was conducted. User involvement in designing interventions was limited, and eHealth intervention developmental frameworks were rarely used. Strategies to assist users in engaging with technical systems were seldom included in the interventions, and accessibility features were limited. The results of the included studies also provided inconclusive evidence on the effectiveness of eHealth interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight that eHealth literacy is generally overlooked in developing eHealth interventions targeted at socially disadvantaged groups, whereas evidence about the effectiveness of such interventions is limited. To ensure equal access and inclusiveness in the age of eHealth, eHealth literacy of disadvantaged groups needs to be addressed to help avoid a digital divide. This will assist the realization of recent technological advancements and, importantly, improve health equity."
Smartphone App Delivery of a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention for Adult Gamblers (Gambling Habit Hacker): Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial,"Rodda SN, Bagot KL, Merkouris SS, Youssef G, Lubman DI, Thomas AC, Dowling NA.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Jul 26;11(7):e38919. doi: 10.2196/38919.,Rodda SN,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/07/26,PMC9364163,,10.2196/38919,"BACKGROUND: People with gambling problems frequently report repeated unsuccessful attempts to change their behavior. Although many behavior change techniques are available to individuals to reduce gambling harm, they can be challenging to implement or maintain. The provision of implementation support tailored for immediate, real-time, individualized circumstances may improve attempts at behavior change. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and evaluate a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for individuals who require support to adhere to their gambling limits. JITAI development is based on the principles of the Health Action Process Approach with delivery, in alignment with the principles of self-determination theory. The primary objective was to determine the effect of action- and coping planning compared with no intervention on the goal of subsequently adhering to gambling expenditure limits. METHODS: Gambling Habit Hacker is delivered as a JITAI providing in-the-moment support for adhering to gambling expenditure limits (primary proximal outcome). Delivered via a smartphone app, this JITAI delivers tailored behavior change techniques related to goal setting, action planning, coping planning, and self-monitoring. The Gambling Habit Hacker app will be evaluated using a 28-day microrandomized trial. Up to 200 individuals seeking support for their own gambling from Australia and New Zealand will set a gambling expenditure limit (ie, goal). They will then be asked to complete 3 time-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) per day over a 28-day period. EMAs will assess real-time adherence to gambling limits, strength of intention to adhere to goals, goal self-efficacy, urge self-efficacy, and being in high-risk situations. On the basis of the responses to each EMA, participants will be randomized to the control (a set of 25 self-enactable strategies containing names only and no implementation information) or intervention (self-enactable strategy implementation information with facilitated action- and coping planning) conditions. This microrandomized trial will be supplemented with a 6-month within-group follow-up that explores the long-term impact of the app on gambling expenditure (primary distal outcome) and a range of secondary outcomes, as well as an evaluation of the acceptability of the JITAI via postintervention surveys, app use and engagement indices, and semistructured interviews. This trial has been approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2020-304). RESULTS: The intervention has been subject to expert user testing, with high acceptability scores. The results will inform a more nuanced version of the Gambling Habit Hacker app for wider use. CONCLUSIONS: Gambling Habit Hacker is part of a suite of interventions for addictive behaviors that deliver implementation support grounded in lived experience. This study may inform the usefulness of delivering implementation intentions in real time and in real-world settings. It potentially offers people with gambling problems new support to set their gambling intentions and adhere to their limits.

Effect of Mobile Phone App-Based Interventions on Quality of Life and Psychological Symptoms Among Adult Cancer Survivors: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Qin M, Chen B, Sun S, Liu X.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Dec 19;24(12):e39799. doi: 10.2196/39799.,Qin M,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/12/19,PMC9808609,,10.2196/39799,"BACKGROUND: Most patients with cancer experience psychological or physical distress, which can adversely affect their quality of life (QOL). Smartphone app interventions are increasingly being used to improve QOL and psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of this type of intervention, with conflicting results in the literature. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the effectiveness of mobile phone app interventions on QOL and psychological outcomes in adult patients with cancer, with a special focus on intervention duration, type of cancer, intervention theory, treatment strategy, and intervention delivery format. METHODS: We conducted a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang to identify studies involving apps that focused on cancer survivors and QOL or psychological symptoms published from inception to October 30, 2022. We selected only randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria and performed systematic review and meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI was pooled when needed. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: In total, 30 randomized controlled trials with a total of 5353 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with routine care, app interventions might improve QOL (SMD=0.39, 95% CI 0.27-0.51; P<.001); enhance self-efficacy (SMD=0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.29; P=.03); and alleviate anxiety (SMD=-0.64, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.56; P<.001), depression (SMD=-0.33, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.08; P=.009), and distress (SMD=-0.34, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.08; P=.01). Short-term (duration of </=3 months), physician-patient interaction (2-way communication using a smartphone app), and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions might be the most effective for improving QOL and alleviating adverse psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that interventions using mobile health apps might improve QOL and self-efficacy as well as alleviate anxiety, depression, and distress in adult cancer survivors. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and the study design. More rigorous trials are warranted to confirm the suitable duration and validate the different intervention theories as well as address methodological flaws in previous studies.

This study comprehensively examined published mHealth intervention studies for obesity and diabetes treatment and management to assess their effectiveness and provide recommendations for future research. We systematically searched PubMed for mHealth-related studies on diabetes and obesity treatment and management published during 2000-2016. Relevant information was extracted and analyzed. Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria and varied in terms of sample size, ethnicity, gender, and age of the participating patients and length of follow-up. The mHealth interventions were categorized into 3 types: mobile phone text messaging, wearable or portable monitoring devices, and applications running on smartphones. Primary outcomes included weight loss (an average loss ranging from -1.97 kg in 16 wk to -7.1 kg in 5 wk) or maintenance and blood glucose reduction (an average decrease of glycated hemoglobin ranging from -0.4% in 10 mo to -1.9% in 12 mo); main secondary outcomes included behavior changes and patient perceptions such as self-efficacy and acceptability of the intervention programs. More than 50% of studies reported positive effects of interventions based on primary outcomes. The duration or length of intervention ranged from 1 wk to 24 mo. However, most studies included small samples and short intervention periods and did not use rigorous data collection or analytic approaches. Although some studies suggest that mHealth interventions are effective and promising, most are pilot studies or have limitations in their study designs. There is an essential need for future studies that use larger study samples, longer intervention (>/= 6 mo) and follow-up periods (>/= 6 mo), and integrative and personalized innovative mobile technologies to provide comprehensive and sustainable support for patients and health service providers."
Rates of Attrition and Dropout in App-Based Interventions for Chronic Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Meyerowitz-Katz G, Ravi S, Arnolda L, Feng X, Maberly G, Astell-Burt T.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Sep 29;22(9):e20283. doi: 10.2196/20283.,Meyerowitz-Katz G,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/09/29,PMC7556375,,10.2196/20283,"BACKGROUND: Chronic disease represents a large and growing burden to the health care system worldwide. One method of managing this burden is the use of app-based interventions; however attrition, defined as lack of patient use of the intervention, is an issue for these interventions. While many apps have been developed, there is some evidence that they have significant issues with sustained use, with up to 98% of people only using the app for a short time before dropping out and/or dropping use down to the point where the app is no longer effective at helping to manage disease. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives are to systematically appraise and perform a meta-analysis on dropout rates in apps for chronic disease and to qualitatively synthesize possible reasons for these dropout rates that could be addressed in future interventions. METHODS: MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL (Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Embase were searched from 2003 to the present to look at mobile health (mHealth) and attrition or dropout. Studies, either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational trials, looking at chronic disease with measures of dropout were included. Meta-analysis of attrition rates was conducted in Stata, version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC). Included studies were also qualitatively synthesized to examine reasons for dropout and avenues for future research. RESULTS: Of 833 studies identified in the literature search, 17 were included in the review and meta-analysis. Out of 17 studies, 9 (53%) were RCTs and 8 (47%) were observational trials, with both types covering a range of chronic diseases. The pooled dropout rate was 43% (95% CI 29-57), with observational studies having a higher dropout rate (49%, 95% CI 27-70) than RCTs in more controlled scenarios, which only had a 40% dropout rate (95% CI 16-63). The studies were extremely varied, which is represented statistically in the high degree of heterogeneity (I(2)>99%). Qualitative synthesis revealed a range of reasons relating to attrition from app-based interventions, including social, demographic, and behavioral factors that could be addressed. CONCLUSIONS: Dropout rates in mHealth interventions are high, but possible areas to minimize attrition exist. Reducing dropout rates will make these apps more effective for disease management in the long term.

A self-guided Internet-based intervention for individuals with chronic pain and depressive symptoms: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Borsutzky S, Moritz S, Hottenrott B, Gehlenborg J.",Trials. 2023 Jul 11;24(1):453. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07440-8.,Borsutzky S,Trials,2023,2023/07/11,PMC10334640,,10.1186/s13063-023-07440-8,"BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of evidence-based therapy options for the treatment of chronic pain and comorbid depressive symptoms (e.g., CBT), many individuals remain untreated. Treatment gaps result from a lack of specialists, patient fear of stigmatization, or patient immobility. Internet-based self-help interventions could serve as an anonymous and flexible alternative treatment option. In a pilot study, chronic pain patients with comorbid depressive symptoms who used a generic Internet-based depression program showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (but not pain symptoms) compared to a waitlist control group. Based on these findings, we developed the low-threshold, anonymous, and cost-free Internet-based self-help intervention Lenio that is tailored to the specific needs of chronic pain patients with comorbid depressive symptoms. Lenio is accompanied by the smartphone application (app) COGITO designed to increase therapeutic success. With Lenio and COGITO addressing both chronic pain and depressive symptoms, the trial aims to increase treatment effects of online interventions for chronic pain patients by reducing both depressive symptoms and pain. METHODS: The effectiveness of the Internet-based self-help intervention and accompanying smartphone app will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 300 participants will be randomized into an intervention group (Lenio/COGITO), an active control group (depression-focused smartphone app), or a waitlist control group. Assessments will be done at baseline, after an 8-week intervention period (post), and after 16 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome is the post-assessment reduction in ""pain impairment"" (mean value of impairment in daily life, free time, and work) as assessed by the DSF (German pain questionnaire). Secondary outcomes will include the reduction in depressive symptoms as well as in the severity of pain. DISCUSSION: Lenio is one of the first Internet-based interventions to reduce chronic pain and depression that will be empirically evaluated. Internet-based interventions could offer a promising alternative to conventional face-to-face psychotherapy in the treatment of chronic pain patients. The primary objective of the current study is to add essential insight into the feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptance of Internet-based interventions for people with chronic pain and depressive symptoms.

Effectiveness of online and mobile telephone applications ('apps') for the self-management of suicidal ideation and self-harm: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Witt K, Spittal MJ, Carter G, Pirkis J, Hetrick S, Currier D, Robinson J, Milner A.",BMC Psychiatry. 2017 Aug 15;17(1):297. doi: 10.1186/s12888-017-1458-0.,Witt K,BMC Psychiatry,2017,2017/08/17,PMC5558658,,10.1186/s12888-017-1458-0,"BACKGROUND: Online and mobile telephone applications ('apps') have the potential to improve the scalability of effective interventions for suicidal ideation and self-harm. The aim of this review was therefore to investigate the effectiveness of digital interventions for the self-management of suicidal ideation or self-harm. METHODS: Seven databases (Applied Science & Technology; CENTRAL; CRESP; Embase; Global Health; PsycARTICLES; PsycINFO; Medline) were searched to 31 March, 2017. Studies that examined the effectiveness of digital interventions for suicidal ideation and/or self-harm, or which reported outcome data for suicidal ideation and/or self-harm, within a randomised controlled trial (RCT), pseudo-RCT, or observational pre-test/post-test design were included in the review. RESULTS: Fourteen non-overlapping studies were included, reporting data from a total of 3,356 participants. Overall, digital interventions were associated with reductions for suicidal ideation scores at post-intervention. There was no evidence of a treatment effect for self-harm or attempted suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies were biased in relation to at least one aspect of study design, and particularly the domains of participant, clinical personnel, and outcome assessor blinding. Performance and detection bias therefore cannot be ruled out. Digital interventions for suicidal ideation and self-harm may be more effective than waitlist control. It is unclear whether these reductions would be clinically meaningful at present. Further evidence, particularly with regards to the potential mechanisms of action of these interventions, as well as safety, is required before these interventions could recommended."
"The impact of smartphone applications on bowel preparation, compliance with appointments, cost-effectiveness, and patients' quality of life for the colonoscopy process: A scoping review","Aksan F, Tanriverdi LH, Figueredo CJ, Barrera LC, Hasham A, Jariwala SP.",Saudi J Gastroenterol. 2023 Mar-Apr;29(2):71-87. doi: 10.4103/sjg.sjg_207_22.,Aksan F,Saudi J Gastroenterol,2023,2022/09/08,PMC10270477,,10.4103/sjg.sjg_207_22,"The aim of this scoping review is to evaluate the impact of smartphone application (SPA) technology in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy to measure compliance with appointments, cost-effectiveness, bowel preparation, and quality of life. The scoping review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Ovid Medline, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and PubMed were screened up to Oct 14, 2020, and bibliographies of the retrieved articles were included. Based on pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, 8 primary studies were included in the final analysis from a total of 3,979 non-duplicate articles. Seven out of eight studies measured the bowel preparation quality. In six of these studies, patients in the smartphone group had a successful bowel preparation when compared with the control arm; on the other hand, one study did not find any differences between groups. Adherence to colonoscopy screening was assessed by one study. Patients in the digital intervention arm were significantly more likely to complete a screening test. Patient satisfaction during the periprocedural period of colonoscopy was assessed by five studies which reported significantly higher patient satisfaction in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. None of the studies measured cost-effectiveness. We came to the conclusion that a well-designed, user-friendly SPA can help and guide patients undergoing colonoscopy through the process of following up on their appointments, adhering to bowel preparation, and better understanding their disease condition. Future trials investigating SPAs should include cost-effectiveness and adherence to appointments as an endpoint."

Tobacco cessation mobile app intervention (Just Kwit! study): protocol for a pilot randomized controlled pragmatic trial,"Chu KH, Escobar-Viera CG, Matheny SJ, Davis EM, Primack BA.",Trials. 2019 Feb 26;20(1):147. doi: 10.1186/s13063-019-3246-2.,Chu KH,Trials,2019,2019/02/28,PMC6390617,,10.1186/s13063-019-3246-2,"BACKGROUND: Adolescence and young adulthood are critical times of initiation and progression to daily use of tobacco. However, it is difficult to recruit young adults to traditional smoking cessation and retention rates are typically low. Smartphone cessation applications (apps) can provide real-time responses to smoking urges and related cues, which are known to be important factors in lapse and relapse. Given the popularity of smartphones among young adults and the considerably higher download rates of commercially developed apps compared to research-based apps, there is a need to design pragmatic studies that evaluate commercial tobacco cessation apps. The aims of this pilot study are to assess the impact on tobacco cessation of using a smartphone app compared with usual care and to generate feasibility data to inform a future fully powered clinical trial. METHODS: We will conduct an open randomized controlled trial with parallel groups. Participants will be selected from hospitalized patients and must be aged 18-30 years, interested in cessation, smoked > 5 cigarettes/day over the past 30 days, and own an Apple or Android smartphone. Participants who are eligible will be randomized to either a smartphone experimental group or patient-initiated follow up (usual care). As this study seeks to assess feasibility, the primary data will include (1) recruitment rates, (2) retention rates, and (3) adherence, measured through user engagement with the app. DISCUSSION: This pilot trial will be the first to evaluate a commercially available smartphone app for tobacco cessation in a hospitalized setting. Data generated by this study can be used for larger fully powered trials such as comparative effectiveness studies against apps developed by academics or health scientists based on behavioral theories, or cost-effectiveness analyses of mobile interventions.

Integration of a smartwatch within an internet-delivered intervention for depression: Protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial on acceptance,"Nadal C, Earley C, Enrique A, Vigano N, Sas C, Richards D, Doherty G.",Contemp Clin Trials. 2021 Apr;103:106323. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2021.106323. Epub 2021 Feb 20.,Nadal C,Contemp Clin Trials,2021,2021/02/23,,,10.1016/j.cct.2021.106323,"BACKGROUND: Mood tracking is commonly employed within a range of mental health interventions. Physical activity and sleep are also important for contextualizing mood data but can be difficult to track manually and rely on retrospective recall. Smartwatches could enhance self-monitoring by addressing difficulties in recall of sleep and physical activity and reducing the burden on patients in terms of remembering to track and the effort of tracking. This feasibility study will explore the acceptance of a smartwatch app for self-monitoring of mood, sleep, and physical activity, in an internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression offered in a routine care setting. METHODS: Seventy participants will be randomly allocated to (i) iCBT intervention plus smartwatch app or (ii) iCBT intervention alone. Patient acceptance will be measured longitudinally using a theory-based acceptance questionnaire to understand and compare the evolution of acceptance of the technology-delivered self-report in the two groups. A post-treatment interview will explore participants subjective experience of using the smartwatch. Engagement with the intervention, including self-report, and clinical outcomes, will be measured across both groups to assess for any differences. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study investigating the evolution of patient acceptance of smartwatch self-report in an iCBT delivered intervention in a clinical sample. Through an engaging and convenient means of capturing ecologically valid mood data, the study has the potential to show that smartwatches are an acceptable means for patient self-monitoring within iCBT interventions for depression and support potential use-cases for smartwatches in the context of mental health interventions in general.

Effective behavioral intervention strategies using mobile health applications for chronic disease management: a systematic review,"Lee JA, Choi M, Lee SA, Jiang N.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2018 Feb 20;18(1):12. doi: 10.1186/s12911-018-0591-0.,Lee JA,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,2018,2018/02/21,PMC5819153,,10.1186/s12911-018-0591-0,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) has continuously been used as a method in behavioral research to improve self-management in patients with chronic diseases. However, the evidence of its effectiveness in chronic disease management in the adult population is still lacking. We conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on process measures as well as health outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve chronic disease management. METHODS: Relevant randomized controlled studies that were published between January 2005 and March 2016 were searched in six databases: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria were RCTs that conducted an intervention using mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets for adult patients with chronic diseases to examine disease management or health promotion. RESULTS: Of the 12 RCTs reviewed, 10 of the mHealth interventions demonstrated statistically significant improvement in some health outcomes. The most common features of mHealth systems used in the reviewed RCTs were real-time or regular basis symptom assessments, pre-programed reminders, or feedbacks tailored specifically to the data provided by participants via mHealth devices. Most studies developed their own mHealth systems including mobile apps. Training of mHealth systems was provided to participants in person or through paper-based instructions. None of the studies reported the relationship between health outcomes and patient engagement levels on the mHealth system. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from mHealth intervention studies for chronic disease management have shown promising aspects, particularly in improving self-management and some health outcomes."

Mobile health can help us to combat suicide through monitoring and treatment. The SmartCrisis V.2.0 randomised clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Intervention to prevent suicidal thoughts and behaviour. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The SmartCrisis V.2.0 study is a randomised clinical trial with two parallel groups, conducted among patients with a history of suicidal behaviour treated at five sites in France and Spain. The intervention group will be monitored using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and will receive an Ecological Momentary Intervention called 'SmartSafe' in addition to their treatment as usual (TAU). TAU will consist of mental health follow-up of the patient (scheduled appointments with a psychiatrist) in an outpatient Suicide Prevention programme, with predetermined clinical appointments according to the Brief Intervention Contact recommendations (1, 2, 4, 7 and 11 weeks and 4, 6, 9 and 12 months). The control group would receive TAU and be monitored using EMA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz. It is expected that, in the near future, our mobile health intervention and monitoring system can be implemented in routine clinical practice. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and psychiatric congresses. Reference number EC005-21_FJD.

Asynchronous mHealth Interventions in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Systematic Scoping Review,"Seppen BF, den Boer P, Wiegel J, Ter Wee MM, van der Leeden M, de Vries R, van der Esch M, Bos WH.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Nov 5;8(11):e19260. doi: 10.2196/19260.,Seppen BF,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/11/05,PMC7677027,,10.2196/19260,"BACKGROUND: Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have surged in popularity in recent years, generating numerous possibilities for their use in health care as mobile health (mHealth) tools. One advantage of mHealth is that it can be provided asynchronously, signifying that health care providers and patients are not communicating in real time. The integration of asynchronous mHealth into daily clinical practice might therefore help to make health care more efficient for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The benefits have been reviewed in various medical conditions, such as diabetes and asthma, with promising results. However, to date, it is unclear what evidence exists for the use of asynchronous mHealth in the field of RA. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to map the different asynchronous mHealth interventions tested in clinical trials in patients with RA and to summarize the effects of the interventions. METHODS: A systematic search of Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, and PsycINFO was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were initially screened and later assessed by two independent researchers. Disagreements on inclusion or exclusion of studies were resolved by discussion. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 1752 abstracts. After deduplication and screening, 10 controlled intervention studies were included. All studies were assessed to be at risk for bias in at least one domain of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. In the 10 selected studies, 4 different types of mHealth interventions were used: SMS reminders (to increase medication adherence or physical activity; n=3), web apps (for disease monitoring and/or to provide medical information; n=5), smartphone apps (for disease monitoring; n=1), and pedometers (to increase and track steps; n=1). Measured outcomes varied widely between studies; improvements were seen in terms of medication compliance (SMS reminders), reaching rapid remission (web app), various domains of physical activity (pedometer, SMS reminders, and web apps), patient-physician interaction (web apps), and self-efficacy (smartphone app). CONCLUSIONS: SMS reminders, web apps, smartphone apps, and pedometers have been evaluated in intervention studies in patients with RA. These interventions have been used to monitor patients or to support them in their health behavior. The use of asynchronous mHealth led to desirable outcomes in nearly all studies. However, since all studies were at risk of bias and methods used were very heterogeneous, high-quality research is warranted to corroborate these promising results."
A systematic review of mobile health technologies to support self-management of concurrent diabetes and hypertension,"Choi W, Wang S, Lee Y, Oh H, Zheng Z.",J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2020 Jun 1;27(6):939-945. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocaa029.,Choi W,J Am Med Inform Assoc,2020,2020/05/02,PMC7647310,,10.1093/jamia/ocaa029,"OBJECTIVE: This article reports results from a systematic literature review of the current state of mobile health (mHealth) technologies that have the potential to support self-management for people with diabetes and hypertension. The review aims to (a) characterize mHealth technologies used or described in the mHealth literature and (b) summarize their effects on self-management for people with diabetes and hypertension from the clinical and technical standpoints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Online databases were searched in September 2018 to identify eligible studies for review that had been published since 2007, the start of the smartphone era. Data were extracted from included studies based on the PICOS framework. RESULTS: Of the 11 studies included for in-depth review, 5 were clinical research examining patient health outcomes and 6 were technology-focused studies examining users' experiences with mHealth technologies under development. The most frequently used mHealth technology features involved self-management support (n = 11) followed by decision support (n = 6) and shared decision-making (n = 6). Most clinical studies reported benefits associated with mHealth interventions. These included reported improvements in objectively measured patient health outcomes (n = 3) and perceptual or behavioral outcomes (n = 4). DISCUSSION: Although most studies reported promising results in terms of the effects of mHealth interventions on patient health outcomes and experience, the strength of evidence was limited by the study designs. CONCLUSION: More randomized clinical trials are needed to examine the promise and limitations of mHealth technologies as assistive tools to facilitate the self-management of highly prevalent comorbidity of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension."
Systematic Review of Smartphone Apps as a mHealth Intervention to Address Substance Abuse in Adolescents and Adults,"Kazemi DM, Li S, Levine MJ, Auten B, Granson M.",J Addict Nurs. 2021 Jul-Sep 01;32(3):180-187. doi: 10.1097/JAN.0000000000000416.,Kazemi DM,J Addict Nurs,2021,2021/09/02,,,10.1097/JAN.0000000000000416,"BACKGROUND: Substance abuse represents a foremost national concern for adolescents and adults; investigators have implemented a variety of interventions, delivered with both in-person and mobile-based apps' modalities. The electronic techniques could be more effective because they avoid the cost, privacy, and accessibility issues associated with in-person intervention. To address this issue, a systematic review of the scientific evidence relative to the efficacy of app-based interventions delivered by mobile devices (smartphones) to reduce substance abuse in adolescents and adults was carried out. METHODS: To identify relevant studies published from 2005 to 2019, a comprehensive search was conducted. Databases that were searched include CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Keywords and relevant controlled vocabulary terms related to substance abuse and technology were included. Studies were included if they had examined reductions in substance abuse and problem behaviors as a primary outcome with app-based interventions delivered to adolescents and adults. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 21,641 articles, duplicates were removed, and 14,797 citations remained; title/abstract screening yielded 190 full-text articles. One hundred seventy-three were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 17 final articles to be analyzed in this review. Use of app-based interventions showed some evidence of effectiveness in reducing substance abuse in the adolescent adult population. CONCLUSION: Most intervention studies analyzed focused on alcohol reduction. Further research is needed on diverse substance abuse utilizing larger sample sizes, longitudinal studies, and theoretical foundations on the practice of delivering interventions using mobile-based apps."
Smartphone-assisted guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy for young people with distressing voices (SmartVoices): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Cavelti M, Kaeser JM, Lerch S, Bauer S, Moessner M, Berger T, Hayward M, Kaess M.",Trials. 2022 Oct 23;23(1):902. doi: 10.1186/s13063-022-06846-0.,Cavelti M,Trials,2022,2022/10/24,PMC9590132,,10.1186/s13063-022-06846-0,"BACKGROUND: The long-standing view that auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) or hearing voices is a sign of schizophrenia has been challenged by research demonstrating that they lie on a continuum ranging from normal to pathological experience related to distress and need for care. Hearing voices is more prevalent in adolescence than in later life, and hearing voices during adolescence indicates a risk for severe psychopathology, functional impairments, and suicide later in life. While there is increasing evidence for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for voices (CBTv) in adults with schizophrenia, research on psychological treatments for youth with distressing voices has been scarce. The aim of the current study is to examine the efficacy of CBTv, delivered using smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessment Intervention (EMI) in a transdiagnostic sample of youth. METHODS: This is a superiority randomized controlled trial comparing 8 weeks of CBTv-based EMI in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU only. TAU covers both no treatment and any form of psychiatric/psychological treatment. In the EMI condition, participants will be prompted twice a day to complete an EMA survey, and receive one intervention proposal per assessment. One-hundred fifty-four youth aged 14-25 years with distressing voices will be recruited from psychiatric clinics, local private practices, internet forums, and advertisements in print and social media. Before and after the intervention phase, participants will undergo a 9-day EMA. Single-blinded assessments will be conducted at baseline (T0) and at 3-month (T1) and 6-month (T2) follow-up. The primary outcome is the distress dimension of the Auditory Hallucinations subscale of the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales at T1. Secondary outcomes include perceived hostile intention, power, and dominance of voices, passive, aggressive, and assertive relating to voices, and negative core beliefs about the self. DISCUSSION: Adolescence provides a crucial window of opportunity for early intervention for hearing voices. However, youth are notoriously reluctant help-seekers. This study offers a low-intensity psychological intervention for youth with distressing voices beyond diagnostic boundaries that, using a mobile technology approach, may match the treatment preferences of the generation of ""digital natives.""

PA interventions focused on AA women living in resource-limited communities with scarce PA infrastructure are needed. Mobile health (mHealth) technology can increase access to PA interventions. We describe the development of a clinical protocol for a multilevel, community-based, mHealth PA intervention for AA women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An mHealth intervention targeting AA women living in resource-limited Washington, DC communities was developed based on the socioecological framework for PA. Over 6 months, we will use a Sequential Multi-Assignment, Randomized Trial approach to compare the effects on PA of location-based remote messaging (named 'tailored-to-place') to standard remote messaging in an mHealth intervention. Participants will be randomised to a remote messaging intervention for 3 months, at which point the intervention strategy will adapt based on individuals' PA levels. Those who do not meet the PA goal will be rerandomised to more intensive treatment. Participants will be followed for another 3 months to determine the contribution of each mHealth intervention to PA level. This protocol will use novel statistical approaches to account for the adaptive strategy. Finally, effects of PA changes on CVD risk biomarkers will be characterised. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been developed in partnership with a Washington, DC-area community advisory board to ensure feasibility and acceptability to community members. The National Institutes of Health Intramural IRB approved this research and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute provided funding. Once published, results of this work will be disseminated to community members through presentations at community advisory board meetings and our quarterly newsletter.

Self-management is a key element in the care of persistent LBP and NP. Artificial intelligence can be used to support and tailor self-management interventions, but their effectiveness needs to be ascertained. The aims of this trial are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of an individually tailored app-based self-management intervention (selfBACK) adjunct to usual care in people with LBP and/or NP in secondary care compared with usual care only, and (2) to compare the effectiveness of selfBACK with a web-based self-management intervention without individual tailoring (e-Help). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised, assessor-blind clinical trial with three parallel arms: (1) selfBACK app adjunct to usual care; (2) e-Help website adjunct to usual care and (3) usual care only. Patients referred to St Olavs Hospital, Trondheim (Norway) with LBP and/or NP and accepted for assessment/treatment at the multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for back or neck rehabilitation are invited to the study. Eligible and consenting participants are randomised to one of the three arms with equal allocation ratio. We aim to include 279 participants (93 in each arm). Outcome variables are assessed at baseline (before randomisation) and at 6-week, 3-month and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome is musculoskeletal health measured by the Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire at 3 months. A mixed-methods process evaluation will document patients' and clinicians' experiences with the interventions. A health economic evaluation will estimate the cost-effectiveness of both interventions' adjunct to usual care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Central Norway (Ref. 2019/64084). The results of the trial will be published in peer-review journals and presentations at national and international conferences relevant to this topic. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04463043."
An mHealth intervention programme to promote healthy behaviours and prevent adolescent obesity (TeenPower): A study protocol,"Sousa P, Duarte E, Ferreira R, Esperança A, Frontini R, Santos-Rocha R, Luís L, Dias SS, Marques N.",J Adv Nurs. 2019 Mar;75(3):683-691. doi: 10.1111/jan.13905. Epub 2019 Jan 10.,Sousa P,J Adv Nurs,2019,2018/11/07,,,10.1111/jan.13905,"AIM: This paper describes the design and rationale of multicenter practice-based research that aims to develop and evaluate an innovative mobile health (mHealth) intervention programme directed to promote healthy behaviours and prevent adolescent obesity. DESIGN: This study is designed as a non-randomized controlled trial with a three-arm structure. METHODS: Twelve to 16 years old participants will be recruited from schools, with access to the Internet and smartphone/tablet devices. The intervention group will be invited to engage in the TeenPower mHealth programme and divided into two subgroups: Group A (additionally engaged in a structured school-based intervention programme) and Group B (only engaged in the mHealth programme). The mHealth app includes educational resources, self-monitoring, social support, interactive training modules and motivational tools. The control group will only follow the structured school-based intervention programme. The intervention length will be 3 months, including the direct support of an interdisciplinary team (nursing, nutrition, sports, psychology, among others). This research was approved and funded in August 2017. DISCUSSION: The positive evaluation of the intervention programme will stimulate the inclusion of technologies in the promotion of salutogenic behaviours and obesity prevention. IMPACT: Adolescent obesity reached epidemic proportions. It is urgent to find effective prevention strategies to induce change at the individual, family and community level. If effective, this protocol can be used by health and exercise professionals in improving community interventions tailored to teenagers."
Smartphone app-based interventions on physical activity behaviors and psychological correlates in healthy young adults: A systematic review,"He Z, Hassan MA, Saiz-González P, Ryu S, Wang R, Gao Z.",PLoS One. 2024 Apr 5;19(4):e0301088. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0301088. eCollection 2024.,He Z,PLoS One,2024,2024/04/05,PMC10997080,,10.1371/journal.pone.0301088,"BACKGROUND: The issue of low physical activity (PA) levels among the youth is a longstanding concern. Smartphone applications offer a promising avenue for delivering interventions that are both accessible and engaging. Up to now, there appears to be a gap in the literature, with no systematic reviews assessing the efficacy of smartphone apps in encouraging increased physical activity among healthy young adults. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the effects of a smartphone app-based intervention on PA and PA-related psychological correlates in healthy young adults (18-35 years old). METHODS: A search was conducted on eighteen databases: PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Academic Search Premier, Communication and Mass Media Complete, Article First, Biomed Central, BioOne, EBSCOHost, JSTOR, ProQuest, SAGE Reference Online, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Taylor&Francis, and Wiley Online. The search covered the period up until December 2023. This research included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of smartphone app-based interventions on PA and PA related psychological outcomes in healthy young adults. The overall impact was determined by vote counting based on the direction of effect and aggregating p values. The quality of the evidence was evaluated using an 8-item scale. This study has been registered in the PROSPERO database with the identification number CRD42023390033. RESULTS: A total of 8403 articles were retrieved, and based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven articles were selected for inclusion. Among these articles, four high-quality RCTs were identified, and the results of vote counting and combining p values methods suggested that smartphone-based app interventions did not demonstrate significant effectiveness in improving PA and PA-related psychological outcomes. However, some improvements were observed. The analysis results, which were categorized into fitness apps and health apps based on the characteristics of the interventions, also failed to demonstrate significant intervention effects. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that, currently, there are no significant effects of smartphone app interventions on improving PA and PA-related psychological outcomes in healthy young adults aged 18-35 years. It is important to note that these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of included studies. Future research should focus on employing high-quality study designs to determine the true effects of interventions and analyze various smartphone app interventions. These analyses should encompass different app characteristics (e.g., fitness app and health app), various combinations (e.g., fitness app alone and fitness app in combination with other interventions), diverse intervention goals (e.g., PA and PA along with other outcomes), and multiple intervention characteristics (e.g., frequency and duration)."
Evaluation of smartphone APP-based case-management services among antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-positive men who have sex with men: a randomized controlled trial protocol,"Fan X, She R, Liu C, Zhong H, Lau JTF, Hao C, Li J, Hao Y, Li L, Gu J.",BMC Public Health. 2020 Jan 20;20(1):85. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-8171-5.,Fan X,BMC Public Health,2020,2020/01/22,PMC6971898,,10.1186/s12889-020-8171-5,"BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionally affected by HIV in China. 'Treatment as Prevention' is a promising strategy for HIV prevention but requires adequate adherence. Mobile health (mHealth) may be an acceptable and feasible approach for service delivery, but there is little evidence supporting mHealth intervention for improving antiretroviral treatment adherence among HIV-infected MSM in low- and middle-income countries, including China. This study will aim to develop a smartphone application-based case-management service and compare its efficacy to standard care with regards to adherence, CD4, HIV viral load and psychosocial outcomes among MSM patients in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: A non-blinded 1:1 parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, with 300 MSM enrolled in each arm. Eligible MSM who are newly initiating ART will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (standard-of-care case management plus mHealth intervention) or a control group (standard-of-care case management). The development of the mHealth intervention will be based on the information-motivation-behavioural skills theory of ART adherence, and comprise four components: educational articles, one-to-one online communication with case managers, support-service information and hospital-visit reminders. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12. The primary outcomes will be ART adherence and CD4 count at month 6. Secondary outcomes include HIV RNA, sexual behaviours, mental health status, illness perceptions, and quality of life. chi(2) test and t-test will be used for between-group comparisons. Intervention effects will be evaluated using General estimating equation performed by SAS 9.0, on the principle of intention-to-treat. Structural equation modelling will be used to test potential mechanisms of intervention effect. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to explore the efficacy of mHealth intervention in the case management services targeted at HIV-infected MSM in low-and middle-income countries. Once proven effective, the innovative mHealth service could be integrated into the routine case management of PLWH. as well as be tailored to the patient management service for other chronic conditions.

Efficacy of digital cognitive behavioural therapy for symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder: a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Gu J, Miller CB, Henry AL, Espie CA, Davis ML, Stott R, Emsley R, Smits JAJ, Craske M, Saunders KEA, Goodwin G, Carl JR.",Trials. 2020 Apr 23;21(1):357. doi: 10.1186/s13063-020-4230-6.,Gu J,Trials,2020,2020/04/25,PMC7181570,,10.1186/s13063-020-4230-6,"BACKGROUND: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and disabling condition with considerable personal and economic impact. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a recommended psychological therapy for GAD; however, there are substantial barriers to accessing treatment. Digital CBT, in particular smartphone-delivered CBT, has the potential to improve accessibility and increase dissemination of CBT. Despite the emerging evidence of smartphone-based psychological interventions for reducing anxiety, effect size scores are typically smaller than in-person interventions, and there is a lack of research assessing the efficacy of smartphone-delivered digital interventions specifically for GAD. METHODS: In the DeLTA trial (DigitaL Therapy for Anxiety), we plan to conduct a parallel-group superiority randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of a novel smartphone-based digital CBT intervention for GAD compared to a waitlist control. We aim to recruit 242 adults (aged 18 years or above) with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. This trial will be conducted entirely online and will involve assessments at baseline (week 0; immediately preceding randomisation), mid-intervention (week 3), post-intervention (week 6; primary end point) and follow-up (week 10). The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention on GAD symptom severity compared to a waitlist control at post-intervention. Secondary objectives are to examine between-group effects on GAD at follow-up, and to examine the following secondary outcomes at both post-intervention and follow-up: 1) worry; 2) depressive symptoms; 3) wellbeing; 4) quality of life; and 5) sleep difficulty. DISCUSSION: This trial will report findings on the initial efficacy of a novel digital CBT intervention for GAD. Results have the potential to contribute towards the evidence base for digital CBT for GAD and increase the dissemination of CBT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12765810.

Manaaki - a cognitive behavioral therapy mobile health app to support people experiencing gambling problems: a randomized control trial protocol,"Humphrey G, Chu J, Dowling N, Rodda S, Merkouris S, Parag V, Newcombe D, Ho E, Nosa V, Ruwhui-Collins R, Whittaker R, Bullen C.",BMC Public Health. 2020 Feb 6;20(1):191. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-8304-x.,Humphrey G,BMC Public Health,2020,2020/02/08,PMC7006157,,10.1186/s12889-020-8304-x,"BACKGROUND: The low utilisation of current treatment services by people with gambling problems highlights the need to explore new modalities of delivering treatment interventions. This protocol presents the design of a pragmatic randomized control trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness and acceptability of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via a mobile app for people with self-reported gambling problems. METHODS: An innovative CBT mobile app, based on Deakin University's GAMBLINGLESS online program, has been adapted with end-users (Manaaki). Six intervention modules have been created. These are interwoven with visual themes to represent a journey of recovery and include attributes such as avatars, videos, and animations to support end-user engagement. An audio facility is used throughout the app to cater for different learning styles. Personalizing the app has been accomplished by using greetings in the participant's language and their name (e.g. Kia ora Tane) and by creating personalized feedback. A pragmatic, randomized control two-arm single-blind trial, will be conducted in New Zealand. We aim to recruit 284 individuals. Eligible participants are >/=18 years old, seeking help for their gambling, have access to a smartphone capable of downloading an app, able to understand the English language and are willing to provide follow-up information at scheduled time points. Allocation is 1:1, stratified by ethnicity, gender, and gambling symptom severity based on the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS). The intervention group will receive the full mobile cognitive behavioural programme and the waitlist group will receive a simple app that counts down the time left before they have access to the full app and the links to the data collection tools. Data collection for both groups are: baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks post-randomisation. The primary outcome is a change in G-SAS scores. Secondary measures include changes in gambling urges, frequency, expenditure, and readiness to change. Indices of app engagement, utilisation and acceptability will be collected throughout the delivery of the intervention. DISCUSSION: If effective, this study will contribute to the improvement of health outcomes for people experiencing gambling problems and have great potential to reach population groups who do not readily engage with current treatment services.

Brief internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: a randomised controlled trial protocol,"Casella CB, Zuccolo PF, Sugaya L, de Souza AS, Otoch L, Alarcão F, Gurgel W, Fatori D, Polanczyk GV.",Trials. 2022 Oct 22;23(1):899. doi: 10.1186/s13063-022-06836-2.,Casella CB,Trials,2022,2022/10/23,PMC9588201,,10.1186/s13063-022-06836-2,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts in many different spheres, including mental health. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable because their central nervous system is still in development and they have fewer coping resources than do adults. Increases in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptomatology have been reported worldwide. However, access to mental health care is limited, especially for the paediatric population and in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we developed a brief internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural intervention for children and adolescents with symptoms of anxiety and depression. The aim of this proposed study is to test the efficacy of the intervention. METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial involving children and adolescents (8-11 and 12-17 years of age, respectively) with symptoms of anxiety, depression or both, according to the 25-item Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (t-score > 70). A total of 280 participants will be randomised to the intervention group or the active control group, in a 1:1 ratio. Those in the intervention group will receive five weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy via teleconference. The sessions will focus on stress responses, family communication, diaphragmatic breathing, emotions, anger management, behavioural activation and cognitive restructuring. Participants in both groups will have access to 15 videos covering the same topics. Participant-guardian pairs will be expected to attend the sessions (intervention group), watch the videos (control group) or both (intervention group only). A blinded assessor will collect data on symptoms of anxiety, depression and irritability, at baseline, at the end of the intervention and 30 days thereafter. Adolescents with access to a smartphone will also be invited to participate in an ecological momentary assessment of emotional problems in the week before and the week after the intervention, as well as in passive data collection from existing smartphone sensors throughout the study. DISCUSSION: Internet-delivered interventions play a major role in increasing access to mental health care. A brief, manualised, internet-delivered intervention might help children and adolescents with anxiety or depressive symptomatology, even outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Personalised app-based relapse prevention of depressive and anxiety disorders in remitted adolescents and young adults: a protocol of the StayFine RCT,"Robberegt SJ, Kooiman BEAM, Albers CJ, Nauta MH, Bockting C, Stikkelbroek Y.",BMJ Open. 2022 Dec 15;12(12):e058560. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058560.,Robberegt SJ,BMJ Open,2022,2022/12/15,PMC9756181,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058560,"INTRODUCTION: Youth in remission of depression or anxiety have high risks of relapse. Relapse prevention interventions may prevent chronicity. Aim of the study is therefore to (1) examine efficacy of the personalised StayFine app for remitted youth and (2) identify high-risk groups for relapse and resilience. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: In this Dutch single-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trial, efficacy of app-based monitoring combined with guided app-based personalised StayFine intervention modules is assessed compared with monitoring only. In both conditions, care as usual is allowed. StayFine modules plus monitoring is hypothesised to be superior to monitoring only in preventing relapse over 36 months. Participants (N=254) are 13-21 years and in remission of depression or anxiety for >2 months. Randomisation (1:1) is stratified by previous treatment (no treatment vs treatment) and previous episodes (1, 2 or >3 episodes). Assessments include diagnostic interviews, online questionnaires and monitoring (ecological momentary assessment with optional wearable) after 0, 4, 12, 24 and 36 months. The StayFine modules are guided by certified experts by experience and based on preventive cognitive therapy and ingredients of cognitive behavioural therapy. Personalisation is based on shared decision-making informed by baseline assessments and individual symptom networks. Time to relapse (primary outcome) is assessed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-lifetime version diagnostic interview. Intention-to-treat survival analyses will be used to examine the data. Secondary outcomes are symptoms of depression and anxiety, number and duration of relapses, global functioning, and quality of life. Mediators and moderators will be explored. Exploratory endpoints are monitoring and wearable outcomes. ETHICS, FUNDING AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by METC Utrecht and is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (636310007). Results will be submitted to peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at (inter)national conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05551468; NL8237."

Although evidence supports pain-self management as effective for reducing pain and disability, most youth do not have access to psychological intervention. Our prior studies demonstrate that an existing internet-delivered pain self-management program (WebMAP) can reduce barriers to care, is feasible, acceptable, and is effective in reducing pain-related disability in youth with chronic pain. The current trial seeks to: 1) determine the effectiveness of a mobile app version of WebMAP for improving patient pain-related outcomes, and 2) evaluate a novel implementation strategy to maximize the public health impact of the intervention including the determination of adoption, reach, and sustainability of WebMAP in specialty clinics serving children with chronic pain in the United States. METHODS: This hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized controlled trial employs a stepped wedge design in which the WebMAP mobile intervention is sequentially implemented in 8 specialty pain clinics following a usual care period. This trial aims to enroll a minimum of 120 youth (ages 10-17) who have chronic pain. Outcome analyses will determine effectiveness of treatment on adolescent pain-related outcomes as well as public health impact via reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: This trial examines an innovative approach to evaluate a technology-delivered pain self-management program for youth with chronic pain. Findings are expected to yield a strategic approach for delivering a digital pain management program for youth with chronic pain that can be sustained in clinical settings.

Internet-based behavioural activation to improve depressive symptoms and prevent child abuse in postnatal women (SmartMama): a protocol for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Obikane E, Baba T, Shinozaki T, Obata S, Nakanishi S, Murata C, Ushio E, Suzuki Y, Shirakawa N, Honda M, Sasaki N, Nishi D, O'Mahen H, Kawakami N.",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2021 Apr 20;21(1):314. doi: 10.1186/s12884-021-03767-9.,Obikane E,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,2021,2021/04/21,PMC8057289,,10.1186/s12884-021-03767-9,"BACKGROUND: Child abuse and postnatal depression are two public health problems that often co-occur, with rates of childhood maltreatment highest during the first year of life. Internet-based behavioural activation (iBA) therapy has demonstrated its efficacy for improving postnatal depression. No study has examined whether the iBA program is also effective at preventing child abuse. This study aims to investigate whether iBA improves depressive symptoms among mothers and prevents abusive behaviours towards children in postpartum mothers in a randomized controlled trial, stratifying on depressive mood status. The study also evaluates the implementation aspects of the program, including how users, medical providers, and managers perceive the program in terms of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and harm done. METHODS: The study is a non-blinded, stratified randomized controlled trial. Based on cut-off scores validated on Japanese mothers, participants will be stratified to either a low Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) group, (EPDS 0-8 points) or a high EPDS group (EPDS >/=9 points). A total of 390 postnatal women, 20 years or older, who have given birth within 10 weeks and have regular internet-access will be recruited at two hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment, with treatment as usual (TAU) or through intervention groups. The TAU group receives 12 weekly iBA sessions with online assignments and feedback from trained therapists. Co-primary outcomes are maternal depressive symptoms (EPDS) and psychological aggression toward children (Conflict Tactic Scale 1) at the 24-week follow-up survey. Secondary outcomes include maternal depressive symptoms, parental stress, bonding relationship, quality of life, maternal health care use, and paediatric outcomes such as physical development, preventive care attendance, and health care use. The study will also investigate the implementation outcomes of the program. DISCUSSION: The study investigates the effectiveness of the iBA program for maternal depressive symptoms and psychological aggression toward children, as well as implementation outcomes, in a randomized-controlled trial. The iBA may be a potential strategy for improving maternal postnatal depression and preventing child abuse.

Efficacy of a transdiagnostic ecological momentary intervention for improving self-esteem (SELFIE) in youth exposed to childhood adversity: study protocol for a multi-center randomized controlled trial,"Daemen M, Postma MR, Lindauer R, Hoes-van der Meulen I, Nieman D, Delespaul P, Breedvelt JJF, van der Gaag M, Viechtbauer W, Schruers K, van den Berg D, Bockting C, van Amelsvoort T, Reininghaus U.",Trials. 2021 Sep 19;22(1):641. doi: 10.1186/s13063-021-05585-y.,Daemen M,Trials,2021,2021/09/20,PMC8449997,,10.1186/s13063-021-05585-y,"BACKGROUND: Targeting low self-esteem in youth exposed to childhood adversity is a promising strategy for preventing adult mental disorder, but psychological help remains difficult to access and accept for youth, calling for novel, youth-friendly approaches. Mobile Health (mHealth) and, most prominently, ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) provide a unique opportunity to deliver youth-friendly, personalized, real-time, guided self-help interventions. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a novel, accessible, transdiagnostic ecological momentary intervention for improving self-esteem ('SELFIE') in youth with prior exposure to childhood adversity. METHODS/DESIGN: In a parallel-group, assessor-blind, multi-center randomized controlled trial, individuals aged 12-26 years with prior exposure to childhood adversity and low self-esteem will be randomly allocated to SELFIE in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) as the experimental condition or the control condition of TAU only, which will include access to all standard health care. SELFIE is a digital guided self-help intervention administered through a smartphone-based app to allow for interactive, personalized, real-time and real-world transfer of intervention components in individuals' daily lives, blended with three training sessions delivered by trained mental health professionals over a 6-week period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up by blinded assessors. The primary outcome will be the level of self-esteem as measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). DISCUSSION: The current study is the first to establish the efficacy of an EMI focusing on improving self-esteem transdiagnostically in youth exposed to childhood adversity. If this trial provides evidence on the efficacy of SELFIE, it has significant potential to contribute to minimizing the deleterious impact of childhood adversity and, thereby, preventing the development of mental disorder later in life.

This economic evaluation seeks to quantify the cost-effectiveness of this mHealth intervention from a healthcare provider and societal perspective. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The V-SMART trial will recruit 902 patients treated for MDR-TB across seven participating provinces in Vietnam. Participants in both intervention and control groups will receive standard community-based therapy for MDR-TB. Participants in the intervention group will also have a purpose-designed App installed on their smartphones to report AEs to health workers and to facilitate timely management of AEs. This economic evaluation will compare the costs and health outcomes between the intervention group (mHealth) and the control group (standard of care). Costs associated with delivering the intervention and health service utilisation will be recorded, as well as patient out-of-pocket costs. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of study participants will be captured using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be based on the primary outcome (proportion of patients with treatment success after 24 months) and QALYs gained. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to test the robustness of the ICERs. A budget impact analysis will be conducted from a payer perspective to provide an estimate of the total budget required to scale-up delivery of the intervention.

Use of Technology-Based Tools to Support Adolescents and Young Adults With Chronic Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Low JK, Manias E.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Jul 18;7(7):e12042. doi: 10.2196/12042.,Low JK,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/07/20,PMC6670279,,10.2196/12042,"BACKGROUND: With the large amount of material that is readily available on the internet, there are endless opportunities for electronic health-literate patients to obtain and learn new information. Although novel, a Web- or mobile-based program can be a powerful way to engage adolescents and young adults (AYAs). The ongoing engagement of AYAs with chronic disease is vital not only to empower them but also to ensure a smooth transition from pediatric to adult health care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the current evidence on Web- or mobile-based interventions designed for AYAs. METHODS: This review was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42018096487. A systematic search of MEDLINE Complete, EMBASE, and CINAHL Complete was conducted on April 10, 2019, for studies that examined the perspectives of transition-age patients about technology-based interventions, the process involved in intervention development, or the evaluation of intervention efficacy. For each study, the comprehensiveness of reporting was appraised. The Downs and Black checklist was used for intervention efficacy trials, the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist was used for qualitative work, and a 16-item tool developed by Tong et al was used for questionnaire research. RESULTS: The search uncovered 29 relevant studies, which included qualitative studies (n=14), intervention efficacy studies (n=7), questionnaire studies (n=4), mixed qualitative and questionnaire studies (n=2), and a mixed qualitative and pilot randomized controlled trial study (n=1). The reporting comprehensiveness score of questionnaires was rated considerably lower (n=6, 13%-57% [2/16-8/14]) than the scores of intervention efficacy trials (n=8, 48%-85% [13/27-23/27]) and qualitative research (n=17, 40%-93% [8.5/21-19.5/21]). AYAs were receptive to obtaining information via a website or mobile app. An intervention was more likely to be perceived as useful by AYAs when there was a concerted effort to involve AYAs and subject matter experts in the process of intervention design, as opposed to relying solely on the AYAs or the experts alone. The preferred medium of intervention delivery varied greatly for AYAs, ranging from static text to audiovisual materials. However, AYAs considered being concise was the most important aspect. Across different conditions, AYAs were interested in receiving information on diverse topics, such as anxiety and stress management, dealing with insurance, and having social relationships. Patients also requested for disease-specific information, such as weather forecasts and pollen levels for patients with asthma and information related to the pretransplant period for organ transplant recipients. Meta-analyses showed no significant group differences across time on quality of life, self-efficacy, and self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the lack of intervention efficacy trials, no conclusion can be drawn if an intervention delivered via a mobile app is better than that delivered via a website. However, through this systematic review, it is confirmed that AYAs were receptive to receiving medical information electronically."
"The effectiveness of mHealth for self-management in improving pain, psychological distress, fatigue, and sleep in cancer survivors: a systematic review","Hernandez Silva E, Lawler S, Langbecker D.",J Cancer Surviv. 2019 Feb;13(1):97-107. doi: 10.1007/s11764-018-0730-8. Epub 2019 Jan 11.,Hernandez Silva E,J Cancer Surviv,2019,2019/01/13,,,10.1007/s11764-018-0730-8,"PURPOSE: Integrating mHealth into the cancer care continuum may be an effective strategy to improve cancer survivorship care by supporting self-management. We aim to assess the effectiveness of mHealth applications (apps) for self-management in improving pain, psychological distress, fatigue, or sleep outcomes in adult cancer survivors. METHODS: Experimental quantitative studies evaluating apps aiming to support self-management for adult cancer survivors and reporting pain, psychological distress, fatigue, or sleep outcomes were included. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception through December 2017. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (PROSPERO registration number CRD42017081182). RESULTS: Seven studies of six mHealth interventions (n = 949 participants) were included. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one quasi-RCT, one non-RCT, and three single-arm studies involved survivors with a mix of cancer types. The most common app features were symptom questionnaires (n = 5) and progress tracking (n = 5). Four studies reported outcomes for pain, with three showing improvements. Two studies reported psychological distress outcomes, showing mixed results. Four studies reported improvements in fatigue post-intervention or in the intervention compared with control group, but the changes were not all statistically significant. Two studies reported improvements in sleep outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence that mHealth interventions that support self-management can improve pain and fatigue outcomes in cancer survivors, and some promise for psychological distress and sleep outcomes. Further development and investigation of mHealth is needed, incorporating targeted, evidence-based models of care into app design. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: mHealth interventions can improve outcomes for cancer survivors and have significant potential to benefit this growing population due to their reach."

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions that incorporate wearables may be able to improve diabetes self-management. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of personalized educational and behavioral interventions delivered through an EMPOWER mobile application (app) among patients with T2DM. METHODS: This is a parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with T2DM recruited from primary care will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive personalized educational and behavioral interventions through the EMPOWER app in addition to their usual clinical care. The control group will receive the usual clinical care for their T2DM but will not have access to the EMPOWER app. Our primary outcome is patient activation score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include HbA1c, physical activity level and diet throughout 12 months; quality of life (QoL), medication adherence, direct healthcare cost and indirect healthcare cost at 6 and 12 months. DISCUSSION: This RCT will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and implementation of personalized educational and behavioral interventions delivered through mobile application in T2DM management. Findings from this study can help to achieve sustainable and cost-effective behavioral change in patients with T2DM, and this can be potentially scaled to other chronic diseases such as hypertension and dyslipidemia."

A substantial proportion of lapses are due to urges to smoke triggered by situational cues. Currently, no available interventions proactively respond to such cues in real time. Quit Sense is a theory-guided just-in-time adaptive intervention smartphone app that uses a learning tool and smartphone sensing to provide in-the-moment tailored support to help smokers manage cue-induced urges to smoke. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of delivering a definitive online efficacy trial of Quit Sense. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A two-arm parallel-group RCT allocating smokers willing to make a quit attempt, recruited via online adverts, to usual care (referral to the NHS SmokeFree website) or usual care plus Quit Sense. Randomisation will be stratified by smoking rate (<16 vs >/=16 cigarettes/day) and socioeconomic status (low vs high). Recruitment, enrolment, baseline data collection, allocation and intervention delivery will be automated through the study website. Outcomes will be collected at 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up via the study website or telephone, and during app usage. The study aims to recruit 200 smokers to estimate key feasibility outcomes, the preliminary impact of Quit Sense and potential cost-effectiveness, in addition to gaining insights on user views of the app through qualitative interviews. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by the Wales NHS Research Ethics Committee 7 (19/WA/0361). The findings will be disseminated to the public, the funders, relevant practice and policy representatives and other researchers. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN12326962."

Cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) for post-traumatic stress disorder: study protocol of an app-based randomised controlled trial,"Kroener J, Greiner A, Sosic-Vasic Z.",BMJ Open. 2023 Feb 16;13(2):e069228. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-069228.,Kroener J,BMJ Open,2023,2023/02/16,PMC9936272,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-069228,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies indicate that computerised trainings implementing cognitive bias modification (CBM) for interpretation bias might be promising treatments for trauma-related cognitive distortions and symptoms. However, results are mixed, which might be related to the implemented task (sentence completion task), setting, or training duration. Within the present study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an app-based intervention for interpretation bias using standardised imagery audio scripts, which is designed as a standalone treatment. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a randomised controlled trial, implementing two parallel arms. 130 patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be allocated to either the intervention group or the waiting-list control group receiving treatment as usual. The intervention consists of 3 weeks of an app-based CBM training for interpretation bias using mental imagery, with three training sessions (20 min) per week. Two months after the last training session, 1 week of booster CBM treatment will be implemented, consisting of three additional training sessions. Outcome assessments will be conducted pretraining, 1 week post-training, 2 months post-training, as well as 1 week after the booster session (approximately 2.5 months after initial training termination). The primary outcome is interpretation bias. Secondary outcomes include PTSD-related cognitive distortions and symptom severity, as well as negative affectivity. Outcome assessment will be conducted by intention-to-treat analysis, as well as per-protocol analysis using linear mixed models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the State Chamber of Physicians in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany (number of approval: F-2022-080). Scientific findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals informing future clinical studies, which focus on the reduction of PTSD-related symptoms using CBM.

Use of Short Message Service and Smartphone Applications in the Management of Surgical Patients: A Systematic Review,"Lu K, Marino NE, Russell D, Singareddy A, Zhang D, Hardi A, Kaar S, Puri V.",Telemed J E Health. 2018 Jun;24(6):406-414. doi: 10.1089/tmj.2017.0123. Epub 2017 Nov 7.,Lu K,Telemed J E Health,2018,2017/11/08,,,10.1089/tmj.2017.0123,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health and telemedicine are rapidly evolving fields used to provide healthcare remotely to patients. For surgical patients, telemedicine can improve patient education and remote monitoring of postoperative symptoms. We performed a systematic review of studies involving the use of short message service (SMS) and mobile application-based interventions in surgical patients to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each system, as well as of mobile interventions as a whole. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Major electronic databases were searched using relevant keywords from inception until November 2016. Studies involving SMS or mobile application-based communication protocols involving at least 25 preoperative or postoperative patients were included. Studies of systems involving communication exclusively between healthcare professionals were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 2,492 unique studies were identified through keyword search. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 studies were included in this review. Intervention modalities were SMS (8 studies), mobile application (4), combined SMS and application (1), automated phone call (1), and electronic transmission of pictures to the physician (1). Intervention methods were symptom monitoring (7), patient education (2), protocol adherence reminders (4), and combined symptom monitoring and protocol adherence reminders (2). Both mobile applications and SMS-based interventions increased adherence to medications and protocols and improved clinic attendance. Lower readmission rates and emergency room visits were reported. Satisfaction with automated communication systems was high for both patients and physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile interventions provide a sophisticated yet simple tool to improve perioperative healthcare. Future considerations to address include usage fatigue and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance concerns."
"Testing the efficacy of a couple-focused, tailored eHealth intervention for symptom self-management among men with prostate cancer and their partners: the study protocol","Song L, Nielsen ME, Chen RC, Rini C, Keyserling TC, Idiagbonya E, Fuller GP, Northouse L, Palmer MH, Tan X.",Trials. 2022 Jan 4;23(1):12. doi: 10.1186/s13063-021-05948-5.,Song L,Trials,2022,2022/01/05,PMC8725423,,10.1186/s13063-021-05948-5,"BACKGROUND: Men with localized prostate cancer often experience urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal symptoms; general distress; pain; fatigue; and sleep disturbance. For men in an intimate relationship, these symptoms disrupt couples' relationships and intimacy. The symptoms also reduce quality of life for both men and their partners, who are often their primary caregivers. Management of the negative effects of cancer and its treatment is a significantly under-addressed supportive care need for these men and their intimate partners. To address these unmet supportive care needs, our interdisciplinary team developed and pilot tested the usability and feasibility of an evidence-based, couple-focused, tailored eHealth intervention, ""Prostate Cancer Education & Resources for Couples"" (PERC). Based on the adapted stress and coping theoretical framework and developed with stakeholder involvement, PERC aims to improve quality of life for both men and their partners by enhancing their positive appraisals, self-efficacy, social support, and healthy behaviors for symptom management. METHODS: We will test the efficacy of PERC using a population-based, geographically and demographically diverse cohort in a randomized controlled trial. Primary aim: Assess if patients and partners receiving PERC will report greater improvement in their cancer-related quality of life scores than those in the control group (usual care plus the National Cancer Institute prostate cancer website) at 4, 8, and 12 months post-baseline. Secondary aim: Test if patients and partners in PERC will report significantly more positive appraisals and higher levels of coping resources at follow-ups than those in the control group. Exploratory aim: Determine if patient race and ethnicity, education, type of treatment, or couples' relationship quality moderate the effects of PERC on patient and partner QOL at follow-ups. DISCUSSION: This study will provide a novel model for self-managing chronic illness symptoms that impact couples' relationships, intimacy, and quality of life. It addresses the National Institute of Nursing Research's goal to develop and test new strategies for symptom self-management to help patients and caregivers better manage their illness and improve quality of life. It also responds to calls for programs from the Institute of Medicine and American Cancer Society to address treatment-related effects and improve survivors' QOL.

Epub 2020 Nov 26.,Garnett C,Addiction,2021,2020/10/17,PMC8436762,,10.1111/add.15287,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Digital interventions are effective for reducing alcohol consumption but evidence is limited regarding smartphone apps. Drink Less is a theory- and evidence-informed app to help people reduce their alcohol consumption that has been refined in terms of its content and design for usability across the sociodemographic spectrum. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of recommending Drink Less at reducing alcohol consumption compared with usual digital care. DESIGN: Two-arm individually randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Online trial in the United Kingdom (UK). PARTICIPANTS: Hazardous or harmful drinkers (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT] score >/=8) aged 18+ who want to drink less alcohol (n = 5562). Participants will be recruited from July 2020 to May 2022 using multiple strategies with a focus on remote digital methods. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomised to receive either an email recommending that they use Drink Less (intervention) or view the National Health Service (NHS) webpage on alcohol advice (comparator). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome is change in self-reported weekly alcohol consumption, assessed using the extended AUDIT-Consumption, between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include change in self-reported weekly alcohol consumption assessed at 1- and 3-month follow-ups, and the proportion of hazardous drinkers; alcohol-related problems and injury; health-related quality of life; and use of health services assessed at 6-month follow-up. Effectiveness will be examined with adjusted regression models, adjusting for baseline alcohol consumption and using an intention-to-treat approach. A mixed-methods process evaluation will assess engagement, acceptability and mechanism of action. Economic evaluations will be conducted using both a short- and longer-term time horizon. COMMENTS: This study will establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Drink Less app at reducing alcohol consumption among hazardous and harmful adult drinkers and will be the first randomised controlled trial of an alcohol reduction app for the general population in the United Kingdom. This study will inform the decision on whether it is worth investing resources in large-scale implementation."
The Stop-Tabac smartphone application for smoking cessation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial in the general population,"Etter JF, Khazaal Y.",Trials. 2020 Jun 1;21(1):449. doi: 10.1186/s13063-020-04377-0.,Etter JF,Trials,2020,2020/06/04,PMC7268412,,10.1186/s13063-020-04377-0,"BACKGROUND: Smartphone-based support can reach thousands of smokers and help those who would otherwise try to quit smoking by themselves with little chance of success. Nicotine medications double the chances of quitting smoking, but few smokers use them, and they often use them for too short a time and at an insufficient dose. It is therefore important to increase access to support for smoking cessation and compliance with nicotine therapy. The objectives of this study are to assess whether the Stop-Tabac application (app) is effective for smoking cessation and to examine whether the outcome is influenced by the personal characteristics of participants. METHODS: Trial design: this is a two-arm, parallel-group, superiority, individually randomized, ""placebo"" controlled trial in 5200 smokers, with follow up after 1 week, 1 month and 6 months. The participants are adult daily smokers (N = 5200) enrolled on the Internet, living in France or Switzerland. The intervention is the Stop-tabac fully-automated app for smartphones, which was launched in 2012 and continuously improved thereafter. It includes fact sheets; calculators of cigarettes not smoked, money saved, and years of life gained; an interactive ""coach"" that provides automated, individually tailored counseling messages based on the user's personal profile, sent regularly for 6 months; immediate feedback during episodes of craving and tobacco withdrawal symptoms; a discussion forum (""The Tribe"") where participants provide and receive social support; a quiz that informs users in a playful way; and a module on nicotine therapy that includes personalized feedback and follow up. The outcome is self-reported smoking cessation after 6 months (no puff of tobacco in the past 4 weeks), and after 1 week and 1 month (no puff in the past 7 days). Participants will be randomized automatically based on a list of random numbers. Participants, assistants in charge of collecting follow-up data and data analysts will be blinded to allocation.

Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment and intervention in a coping-focused intervention for hearing voices (SAVVy): study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Bell IH, Fielding-Smith SF, Hayward M, Rossell SL, Lim MH, Farhall J, Thomas N.",Trials. 2018 May 2;19(1):262. doi: 10.1186/s13063-018-2607-6.,Bell IH,Trials,2018,2018/05/04,PMC5930938,,10.1186/s13063-018-2607-6,"BACKGROUND: Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I) show promise for enhancing psychological treatments for psychosis. EMA has the potential to improve assessment and formulation of experiences which fluctuate day-to-day, and EMI may be used to prompt use of therapeutic strategies in daily life. The current study is an examination of these capabilities in the context of a brief, coping-focused intervention for distressing voice hearing experiences. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a rater-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial comparing a four-session intervention in conjunction with use of smartphone EMA/I between sessions, versus treatment-as-usual. The recruitment target is 34 participants with persisting and distressing voice hearing experiences, recruited through a Voices Clinic based in Melbourne, Australia, and via wider advertising. Allocation will be made using minimisation procedure, balancing of the frequency of voices between groups. Assessments are completed at baseline and 8 weeks post-baseline. The primary outcomes of this trial will focus on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methodology, with secondary outcomes examining preliminary clinical effects related to overall voice severity, the emotional and functional impact of the voices, and emotional distress. DISCUSSION: This study offers a highly novel examination of specific smartphone capabilities and their integration with traditional psychological treatment for distressing voices. Such technology has potential to enhance psychological interventions and promote adaptation to distressing experiences.

Approach-avoidance interventions (AAIs) have been proposed as a way to modify food evaluations and help people to eat in accordance with their dietary goals. Mobile implementations of AAI might be easily accessible, low threshold interventions, but their effectiveness has not been established yet. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants who aim to change their eating behaviour are randomised to intervention or control groups. They complete six sessions of a smartphone-based AAI, in which they push (ie, avoid) or pull (ie, approach) personalised food images. Intervention group participants always avoid foods that they personally want to eat less often and approach foods that they personally want to eat more often. In the control group, images are paired equally often with both response directions. To evaluate contextual and dynamic intervention effects, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is measured throughout, with questions about food intake, hunger, stress, emotions, eating intentions, food craving and impulsivity twice a day. Additional EMA preintervention and postintervention measures are administered before and after the intervention phase (4 days each) with a 1-day follow-up EMA 4 weeks after the intervention. Multilevel models will examine the temporal covariance between approach bias and self-reported variables as well as short-term and long-term intervention effects on approach bias, food intake and craving. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Salzburg. Results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at scientific conferences.

Personalized exposure and experience sampling method feedback versus exposure as usual for obsessive-compulsive disorder: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Hoogerwerf E, Greeven A, Goekoop R, Spinhoven P.",Trials. 2024 Jan 12;25(1):43. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07780-5.,Hoogerwerf E,Trials,2024,2024/01/12,PMC10785525,,10.1186/s13063-023-07780-5,"BACKGROUND: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer from repetitive fearful intrusions which they try to neutralize by performing compulsions. OCD is considered to be the most resistant anxiety disorder with a remission rate of only 53% after a year of an evidence-based treatment. Therefore, it remains an obligation to develop and investigate more effective treatment interventions. This study aims to compare personalized exposure with response prevention (ERP) using experience sampling methodology-based feedback to ERP as usual in patients with OCD. Personalized exposure will be provided screen-to-screen in an ecologically valid (real time and real place) context by means of a smartphone application. This app will also be used to collect both objective and subjective data by means of experience sampling methodology (ESM). This ESM data will be used to identify triggers and protective factors for symptom severity, provide personalized feedback and optimize the effect of ERP. The primary goal of this RCT is to compare the effectiveness of personalized ERP to ERP as usual in the traditional context of a therapist's room in patients with OCD in OCD symptom severity, as well as differences in quality of life, depressive symptoms and anxiety states. Since both self-efficacy and experiential avoidance are known to influence symptom severity in OCS, a secondary goal is to examine if a possible treatment effect is mediated by self-efficacy or experiential avoidance. METHODS: This study involves a randomized controlled trial with 20 weekly sessions by 2 groups (ERP as usual versus personalized ERP), repeated measurements at baseline (T0), 5 weeks of treatment (T1), 10 weeks of treatment (T2), 15 weeks of treatment (T3), posttest at 20 weeks (T4), 6 weeks follow-up (T5), 3 months follow-up (T6), 6 months follow-up (T7) and a year follow-up (T8). A hundred and sixty patients with an OCD diagnosis according to DSM-5 criteria will participate. Half of the group will receive exposure with response prevention as usual, the other half will receive personalized exposure with response prevention with a smartphone application and personalized feedback sessions based on experience sampling data. Multilevel mixed modelling analysis will be used to investigate differences in treatment effect, as well as differences in quality of life, depressive symptoms and anxiety states. We will use the macro of Preacher and Hayes and apply bootstrapping methods to assess the possible mediating effect of changes in self-efficacy and experiential avoidance on subsequent treatment effects. DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial is the first to assess the influence of delivering ERP through video-calling and the use of an ESM intervention on the symptom severity of OCD. Since the global pandemic COVID-19, the use of video-calling to deliver psychological treatments has become more common, increasing the relevance of this study.

DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with meta-analysis. SETTING: Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase and Web of Science were searched from 1990 to November 2018 for RCTs conducted in any healthcare setting. PARTICIPANTS: Studies of participants of any age taking prescribed medication for any health condition and for any duration. INTERVENTION: An app-based intervention delivered through a smartphone, tablet computer or personal digital assistant to help, support or advise about medication adherence. COMPARATOR: One of (1) usual care, (2) a control app which did not use any BCTs to improve medication adherence or (3) a non-app-based comparator. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pooled effect size of changes in medication adherence. The secondary outcome was the association between BCTs used by the apps and the effect size. RESULTS: The initial search identified 13 259 citations. After title and abstract screening, full-text articles of 83 studies were screened for eligibility. Nine RCTs with 1159 recruited participants were included. The mean age of participants was >50 years in all but one study. Health conditions of target populations included cardiovascular disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, psoriasis and multimorbidity. The meta-analysis indicated that patients who use mobile apps to support them in taking medications are more likely to self-report adherence to medications (OR 2.120, 95% CI 1.635 to 2.747, n=988) than those in the comparator groups. Meta-regression of the BCTs did not reveal any significant associations with effect size. CONCLUSIONS: App-based medication adherence interventions may have a positive effect on patient adherence. Larger scale studies are required to further evaluate this effect, including long-term sustainability, and intervention and participant characteristics that are associated with efficacy and app usage.

These women may benefit from easily accessible, nonpharmacologic, and inexpensive self-management approaches, such as via internet and mobile-based interventions, to prevent development of symptoms and/or intervene with current symptoms. This paper summarizes the research protocol of a nationally-funded large-scale randomized controlled study to evaluate ""Mamma Mia,"" a self-guided program with 44 modules that women use throughout pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The program contains a novel combination of components designed to enable women to enhance self-efficacy, emotional self-regulation, and perceived social support. The overall goal of this three-arm longitudinal randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of this self-management approach in diverse women in the U.S. (n = 1950). Enrolled pregnant women will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) ""Mamma Mia"" alone, which is self-guided; (2) ""Mamma Mia Plus"" in which participants engage in the ""Mamma Mia"" modules plus receive brief guided support from a registered nurse; or (3) usual prenatal/postpartum care. The first specific aim is to evaluate effects by group on the primary outcome of interest, depressive symptoms, over time. The second aim is to evaluate effects by group on subjective well-being, anxiety, and stress. Using a conceptual framework based upon Individual and Family Self-Management Theory, the third aim is to evaluate possible mediators (self-efficacy, emotion self-regulation, perceived support) and possible moderators (e.g., race/ethnicity, type of healthcare clinician) of this self-management approach."

A subclinical variant, loss of control eating (LOC) is prevalent in youth. LOC is associated with similar mental distress as full-blown BED, increases the risk to develop a BED and promotes continuous weight gain. The etiology of LOC is not yet fully understood and specialized treatment for youth is scarce. METHODS: The i-BEAT study includes a cross-sectional and longitudinal online questionnaire study (N = 600), an App based daily-life approach and a laboratory virtual reality study in N = 60 youths (14-24 years) with and without LOC as well as a controlled randomized online treatment trial to investigate the feasibility, acceptance and efficacy of a CBT and an interpersonal emotion regulation module for youth (N = 120). The primary outcomes include self-reported as well as measured (heart rate variability, gaze behavior, reaction times in stop signal task) associations between emotion regulation problems (such as dealing with RS), psychological impairment and binge eating in a healthy control group and youth with LOC. Secondary outcomes encompass general eating disorder pathology, social anxiety, body mass index, hyperscanning behavior and therapists' rating of patients' condition pre and post treatment. Epigenetic correlates of RS are assessed in healthy controls and youth with LOC and explored before and after treatment. DISCUSSION: The expected findings will specify the role of interpersonal emotion regulation problems such as coping with the experience of social exclusion and rejection sensitivity (RS) in LOC and clarify, whether including a training to cope with RS adds to the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT).

Whether web-based support in addition to prompts (email and SMS) could be used to promote self-management strategies to facilitate behaviour change in people with COPD is not clear. This clinical trial aims to generate evidence on the effect of a web-based solution, the COPD Web, in a cohort of people with COPD in a primary healthcare context. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The overall design is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with preassessments and postassessments (3 and 12 months) and an implementation and user experience evaluation. People with a diagnosis of COPD, treated in primary healthcare will be eligible for the study. A total of 144 participants will be enrolled through advertisment or by healthcare professionals at included primary healthcare units and, after fulfilled baseline assessment, randomised to either control or intervention group. All participants will receive usual care, a pedometer and a leaflet about the importance of PA. Participants in the intervention will, in addition, get access to the COPD Web, an interactive self-managed website that aims to support people with COPD in self-management strategies. They will also continuously get support from prompts with a focus on behaviour change.The effect on participants' PA, dyspnoea, COPD-related symptoms, HRQoL and health economics will be assessed using accelerometer and questionnaires.

mHealth app using machine learning to increase physical activity in diabetes and depression: clinical trial protocol for the DIAMANTE Study,"Aguilera A, Figueroa CA, Hernandez-Ramos R, Sarkar U, Cemballi A, Gomez-Pathak L, Miramontes J, Yom-Tov E, Chakraborty B, Yan X, Xu J, Modiri A, Aggarwal J, Jay Williams J, Lyles CR.",BMJ Open. 2020 Aug 20;10(8):e034723. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034723.,Aguilera A,BMJ Open,2020,2020/08/22,PMC7443305,,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-034723,"INTRODUCTION: Depression and diabetes are highly disabling diseases with a high prevalence and high rate of comorbidity, particularly in low-income ethnic minority patients. Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual's behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18-75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) >5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB: 17-22608). We plan to submit manuscripts describing our user-designed methods and testing of the adaptive learning algorithm and will submit the results of the trial for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at (inter)-national scientific meetings.

Using smartphones to decrease substance use via self-monitoring and recovery support: study protocol for a randomized control trial,"Scott CK, Dennis ML, Gustafson DH.",Trials. 2017 Aug 10;18(1):374. doi: 10.1186/s13063-017-2096-z.,Scott CK,Trials,2017,2017/08/12,PMC5553728,,10.1186/s13063-017-2096-z,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol abuse, other substance use disorders, and risk behaviors associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent three of the top 10 modifiable causes of mortality in the US. Despite evidence that continuing care is effective in sustaining recovery from substance use disorders and associated behaviors, patients rarely receive it. Smartphone applications (apps) have been effective in delivering continuing care to patients almost anywhere and anytime. This study tests the effectiveness of two components of such apps: ongoing self-monitoring through Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and immediate recovery support through Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs). METHODS/DESIGN: The target population, adults enrolled in substance use disorder treatment (n = 400), are being recruited from treatment centers in Chicago and randomly assigned to one of four conditions upon discharge in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Participants receive (1) EMAs only, (2) EMIs only, (3) combined EMAs + EMIs, or (4) a control condition without EMA or EMI for 6 months. People in the experimental conditions receive smartphones with the apps (EMA and/or EMI) specific to their condition. Phones alert participants in the EMA and EMA + EMI conditions at five random times per day and present participants with questions about people, places, activities, and feelings that they experienced in the past 30 min and whether these factors make them want to use substances, support their recovery, or have no impact. Those in the EMI and EMA + EMI conditions have continual access to a suite of support services. In the EMA + EMI condition, participants are prompted to use the EMI(s) when responses to the EMA(s) indicate risk. All groups have access to recovery support as usual. The primary outcome is days of abstinence from alcohol and other drugs. Secondary outcomes are number of HIV risk behaviors and whether abstinence mediates the effects of EMA, EMI, or EMA + EMI on HIV risk behaviors. DISCUSSION: This project will enable the field to learn more about the effects of EMAs and EMIs on substance use disorders and HIV risk behaviors, an understanding that could potentially make treatment and recovery more effective and more widely accessible.

The overall goal of this programme of research is to develop an integrated smartphone and web-based intervention (HEARTPAfemale symbolN) to help women recognise and self-manage cardiac pain. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol outlines the mixed methods strategy used for the development of the HEARTPAfemale symbolN content/core feature set (phase 2A), usability testing (phase 2B) and evaluation with a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) (phase 3). We are using the individual and family self-management theory, mobile device functionality and pervasive information architecture of mHealth interventions, and following a sequential phased approach recommended by the Medical Research Council to develop HEARTPAfemale symbolN. The phase 3 pilot RCT will enable us to refine the prototype, inform the methodology and calculate the sample size for a larger multisite RCT (phase 4, future work). Patient partners have been actively involved in setting the HEARTPAfemale symbolN research agenda, including defining patient-reported outcome measures for the pilot RCT: pain and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). As such, the guidelines for Inclusion of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Clinical Trial Protocols (SPIRIT-PRO) are used to report the protocol for the pilot RCT (phase 3). Quantitative data (eg, demographic and clinical information) will be summarised using descriptive statistics (phases 2AB and 3) and a content analysis will be used to identify themes (phase 2AB). A process evaluation will be used to assess the feasibility of the implementation of the intervention and a preliminary efficacy evaluation will be undertaken focusing on the outcomes of pain and HRQoL (phase 3). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Toronto (36415; 26 November 2018). We will disseminate knowledge of HEARTPAfemale symbolN through publication, conference presentation and national public forums (Cafe Scientifique), and through fact sheets, tweets and webinars.

A Narrative Review of Methods for Applying User Experience in the Design and Assessment of Mental Health Smartphone Interventions,"Lemon C, Huckvale K, Carswell K, Torous J.",Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2020;36(1):64-70. doi: 10.1017/S0266462319003507. Epub 2020 Jan 24.,Lemon C,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,2020,2020/01/25,,,10.1017/S0266462319003507,"OBJECTIVES: User experience (UX) plays a key role in uptake and usage of mental health smartphone interventions, yet remains underinvestigated. This review aimed to characterize and compare UX evaluation approaches that have been applied in this specific context, and to identify implications for research and practice. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted of UX-themed studies published in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus up to February 2019. Eligible studies reported on data reflecting users' interactions with a smartphone intervention for any mental health condition. Studies were categorized into ""situated"" versus ""construct-based"" methods according to whether or not an established UX construct was used to acquire and analyze data. RESULTS: Situated approaches used bespoke UX metrics, including quantitative measures of usage and performance, as well as grounded interview data. Construct-based approaches such as assessments of usability and acceptability were based on conceptual frameworks, with methodologically stronger versions featuring construct definitions, validated measurement tools, and an ability to compare data across studies. Constructs and measures were sometimes combined to form bespoke construct-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Both situated and construct-based UX data may provide benefits during design and implementation of a mental health smartphone intervention by helping to clarify the needs of users and the impact of new features. Notable however was the omission of UX methods, such as split testing. Future research should consider these unaddressed methods, aim to improve the rigor of UX assessment, integrate their use alongside clinical outcomes, and explore UX assessment of more complex, adaptive interventions."
Current state and future directions of technology-based ecological momentary assessments and interventions for major depressive disorder: protocol for a systematic review,"Colombo D, Palacios AG, Alvarez JF, Patané A, Semonella M, Cipresso P, Kwiatkowska M, Riva G, Botella C.",Syst Rev. 2018 Dec 13;7(1):233. doi: 10.1186/s13643-018-0899-y.,Colombo D,Syst Rev,2018,2018/12/15,PMC6293509,,10.1186/s13643-018-0899-y,"BACKGROUND: Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) represent a novel approach for the assessment and delivery of psychological support to depressed patients in daily life. Beyond the classical paper-and-pencil daily diaries, the more recent progresses in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) enabled researchers to bring all the needed processes together in only one device, i.e., response signaling, repeated symptom collection, information storage, secure data transfer, and psychological support delivery. Despite evidence showing the feasibility and acceptability of these techniques, EMAs are only beginning to be applied in real clinical practice, whether the development of EMIs for clinically depressed patients is still very limited. The objective of this systematic review is to provide the state of the art of technology-based EMAs and EMIs for major depressive disorder (MDD), with the aim of leading the way to possible future directions for the clinical practice. METHODS: We will conduct a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Data sources will include two bibliographic databases, PubMed and Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), supplemented by searches for unpublished or ongoing studies. Eligible studies will report data for adult (>/= 18 years old) with a primary (both current and past) diagnosis of MDD, defined by a valid criterion standard. We will consider studies adopting technology-based EMAs and EMIs for the investigation and/or assessment of depression and for the delivery of a psychological intervention. We will exclude studies adopting paper-and-pencil tools. DISCUSSION: The proposed systematic review will provide new insights on the advantages and benefits of adopting technology-based EMAs and EMIs for MDD in the traditional clinical practice, taking into consideration both clinical and technological issues. The potential of using sensors and biosensors along with machine learning for affective modeling will also be discussed."

This study aims to determine whether an e-health intervention that incorporates symptom/disease activity monitoring and physical activity counselling can improve self-management ability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The 'Empowering active self-management of arthritis: Raising the bar with OPERAS (an On-demand Program to EmpoweR Active Self-management)' project is a randomized controlled trial that uses a delayed control design. One hundred thirty-four participants with RA will be randomly assigned to start the intervention either immediately (immediate group) or 6 months later (delayed group). The intervention involves (1) use of a Fitbit-compatible web app to record and monitor their RA disease activity, symptoms, and time spent on physical activity and a Fitbit; (2) group education and individual counselling by a physiotherapist (PT); and (3) six phone calls with a PT. The primary outcome measure is self-management ability measured by the Patient Activation Measure. Secondary outcome measures include disease status, fatigue, pain, depressive symptoms, and characteristics of habitual behavior and also time spent in physical activity and sedentary activity with a wearable multi-sensor device (SenseWear Mini). After the 6-month intervention, we will interview a sample of participants to examine their experiences with the intervention. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will help to determine whether this technology-enhanced self-management intervention improves self-management ability and health outcomes for people living with RA. A limitation of this study is that participants will need to self-report their symptoms, disease status, and treatment use through questionnaires on the OPERAS web app. The user-friendly interface, reminder emails from the research staff, and tailored guidance from PTs will encourage participants to actively engage with the app. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Date of last update in ClinicalTrials.gov: January 2, 2019.

Detecting and Understanding Social Influence During Drinking Situations: Protocol for a Bluetooth-Based Sensor Feasibility and Acceptability Study,"Jackson K, Meisel M, Sokolovsky A, Chen K, Barnett N.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2024 Jun 6;13:e50650. doi: 10.2196/50650.,Jackson K,JMIR Res Protoc,2024,2024/06/06,,,10.2196/50650,"BACKGROUND: High-risk alcohol consumption among young adults frequently occurs in the presence of peers who are also drinking. A high-risk drinking situation may consist of particular social network members who have a primary association with drinking. Fine-grained approaches such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) are growing in popularity for studying real-time social influence, but studies using these approaches exclusively rely on participant self-report. Passive indicators of peer presence using Bluetooth-based technology to detect real-time interactions have the potential to assist in the development of just-in-time interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using a Bluetooth-based sensor and smartphone app to measure social contact in real-world drinking situations. METHODS: Young adults (N=20) who drink heavily and report social drinking will be recruited from the community to participate in a 3-week EMA study. Using a social network interview, index participants will identify and recruit 3 of their friends to carry a Bluetooth beacon. Participants will complete a series of EMA reports on their own personal Android devices including random reports; morning reports; first-drink reports; and signal-contingent reports, which are triggered following the detection of a beacon carried by a peer participant. EMA will assess alcohol use and characteristics of the social environment, including who is nearby and who is drinking. For items about peer proximity and peer drinking, a customized peer list will be presented to participants. Feedback about the study protocol will be ascertained through weekly contact with both index and peer participants, followed by a qualitative interview at the end of the study. We will examine the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, enrollment of participants and peers, and retention. Feasibility will be determined using indexes of eligibility, enrollment, and recruitment. Acceptability will be determined through participant enrollment and retention, protocol compliance, and participant-reported measures of acceptability. Feasibility and acceptability for peer participants will be informed by enrollment rates, latency to enrollment, compliance with carrying the beacon, and self-reported reasons for compliance or noncompliance with beacon procedures. Finally, EMA data about peer proximity and peer drinking will support the validity of the peer selection process. RESULTS: Participant recruitment began in February 2023, and enrollment was completed in December 2023. Results will be reported in 2025. CONCLUSIONS: The protocol allows us to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a Bluetooth-based sensor for the detection of social contact between index participants and their friends, including social interactions during real-world drinking situations. Data from this study will inform just-in-time adaptive interventions seeking to address drinking in the natural environment by providing personalized feedback about a high-risk social context and alerting an individual that they are in a potentially unsafe situation.

Despite the significant need for palliative cancer care in SSA, coverage remains inadequate. The exploration of digital health approaches could support increases in the quality and reach of palliative cancer care services in SSA. However, there is currently a lack of any theoretical underpinning or data to understand stakeholder drivers for digital health components in this context. This project addresses this gap through engaging with key stakeholders to determine data and information needs that could be supported through digital health interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicountry, cross-sectional, qualitative study conducted in Nigeria, Uganda and Zimbabwe. In-depth interviews will be conducted in patients with advanced cancer (n=20), caregivers (n=15), health professionals (n=20) and policy-makers (n=10) in each of the three participating countries. Data from a total of 195 interviews will transcribed verbatim and translated into English before being imported into NVivo software for deductive framework analysis. The analysis will seek to understand the acceptability and define mechanisms of patient-level data capture and usage via digital technologies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approvals have been obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of University of Leeds (Ref: MREC 18-032), Research Council of Zimbabwe (Ref: 03507), Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe (Ref: MRCZ/A/2421), Uganda Cancer Institute (Ref: 19-2018), Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (Ref: HS325ES) and College of Medicine University of Lagos (Ref: HREC/15/04/2015). The project seeks to determine optimal mechanisms for the design and development of subsequent digital health interventions to support development, access to, and delivery of palliative cancer care in SSA.

Effectiveness of obesity interventions could be increased by providing extended treatment, and by focusing on person-environment interactions. Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) can account for these two factors by allowing an indefinite extension of a treatment protocol in everyday life. EMI relies on observations in daily life to intervene by providing appropriate in-the-moment treatment. The Think Slim intervention is an EMI based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and its effectiveness will be investigated in the current study. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. At least 134 overweight adults (body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m(2)) will be randomly assigned to an 8-week immediate intervention group (Diet + Think Slim intervention, n = 67) or to an 8-week diet-only control group (followed by the Think Slim intervention, n = 67). The Think Slim intervention consists of (1) an app-based EMI that estimates and intervenes when people are likely to overeat, based on Ecological Momentary Assessment data, and (2) ten online computerised CBT sessions which work in conjunction with an EMI module in the app. The primary outcome is BMI. Secondary outcomes include (1) scores on self-report questionnaires for dysfunctional thinking, eating styles, eating disorder pathology, general psychological symptomatology, and self-esteem, and (2) eating patterns, investigated via network analysis. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at 3- and 12-month follow-up measurements. DISCUSSION: This is the first EMI aimed at treating obesity via a cognitive approach, provided via a smartphone app and the Internet, in the context of an RCT.

"Trial protocol: a parallel group, individually randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a mobile phone application to improve sexual health among youth in Stockholm County","Nielsen A, De Costa A, Bågenholm A, Danielsson KG, Marrone G, Boman J, Salazar M, Diwan V.",BMC Public Health. 2018 Feb 5;18(1):216. doi: 10.1186/s12889-018-5110-9.,Nielsen A,BMC Public Health,2018,2018/02/07,PMC5799911,,10.1186/s12889-018-5110-9,"BACKGROUND: Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection is a major public health problem worldwide affecting mostly youth. Sweden introduced an opportunistic screening approach in 1982 accompanied by treatment, partner notification and case reporting. After an initial decline in infection rate till the mid-90s, the number of reported cases has increased over the last two decades and has now stabilized at a high level of 37,000 reported cases in Sweden per year (85% of cases in youth). Sexual risk-taking among youth is also reported to have significantly increased over the last 20 years. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be particularly suitable for youth and sexual health promotion as the intervention is delivered in a familiar and discrete way to a tech savvy at-risk population. This paper presents a protocol for a randomized trial to study the effect of an interactive mHealth application (app) on condom use among the youth of Stockholm. METHODS: 446 youth resident in Stockholm, will be recruited in this two arm parallel group individually randomized trial. Recruitment will be from Youth Health Clinics or via the trial website. Participants will be randomized to receive either the intervention (which comprises an interactive app on safe sexual health that will be installed on their smart phones) or a control group (standard of care). Youth will be followed up for 6 months, with questionnaire responses submitted periodically via the app. Self-reported condom use over 6 months will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include presence of an infection, Chlamydia tests during the study period and proxy markers of safe sex. Analysis is by intention to treat. DISCUSSION: This trial exploits the high mobile phone usage among youth to provide a phone app intervention in the area of sexual health. If successful, the results will have implications for health service delivery and health promotion among the youth. From a methodological perspective, this trial is expected to provide information on the strength and challenges of implementing a partially app (internet) based trial in this context.

Effectiveness of a comprehensive interactive eHealth intervention on patient-reported and clinical outcomes in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ACQUIRE-ICD trial]: study protocol of a national Danish randomised controlled trial,"Pedersen SS, Skovbakke SJ, Wiil UK, Schmidt T, dePont Christensen R, Brandt CJ, Sørensen J, Vinther M, Larroudé CE, Melchior TM, Riahi S, Smolderen KGE, Spertus JA, Johansen JB, Nielsen JC.",BMC Cardiovasc Disord. 2018 Jul 3;18(1):136. doi: 10.1186/s12872-018-0872-7.,Pedersen SS,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,2018,2018/07/05,PMC6029360,,10.1186/s12872-018-0872-7,"BACKGROUND: In Denmark and other countries, there has been a shift in the management of patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with remote device monitoring largely replacing in-hospital visits. Less patient-nurse and patient-physician interaction may lead to gaps in patients' quality of care and impede patients' adaptation to living successfully with the ICD. A comprehensive eHealth intervention that include goal-setting, monitoring of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and quality of life, psychological treatment, information provision, supportive tools, online dialogues with nursing staff and access to an online community network, may help fill these gaps and be particularly beneficial to patients who suffer from anxiety and depression. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the ACQUIRE-ICD care innovation, a comprehensive and interactive eHealth intervention, on patient-reported and clinical outcomes. METHODS: The ACQUIRE-ICD study is a multicenter, prospective, two-arm, unblinded randomised controlled superiority trial that will enroll 478 patients implanted with a first-time ICD or ICD with cardiac synchronisation therapy (CRT-D) from the six implanting centers in Denmark. The trial will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the ACQUIRE-ICD care innovation, as add-on to usual care compared with usual care alone. The primary endpoint, device acceptance, assessed with the Florida Patient Acceptance Survey, is evaluated at 12 months' post implant. Secondary endpoints, evaluated at 12 and 24 months' post implant, include patient-reported outcomes, return to work, time to first ICD therapy and first hospitalisation, mortality and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: The effectiveness of a comprehensive and interactive eHealth intervention that relies on patient-centred and personalised tools offered via a web-based platform targeted to patients with an ICD has not been assessed so far. The ACQUIRE-ICD care innovation promotes and facilitates that patients become active participants in the management of their disease, and as such addresses the need for a more patient-centered disease-management approach. If the care innovation proves to be beneficial to patients, it may not only increase patient empowerment and quality of life but also free up time for clinicians to care for more patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02976961 on November 30, 2016 with registration number [ NCT02976961 ]."

"SlowMo, a digital therapy targeting reasoning in paranoia, versus treatment as usual in the treatment of people who fear harm from others: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","Garety PA, Ward T, Freeman D, Fowler D, Emsley R, Dunn G, Kuipers E, Bebbington P, Waller H, Greenwood K, Rus-Calafell M, McGourty A, Hardy A.",Trials. 2017 Nov 2;18(1):510. doi: 10.1186/s13063-017-2242-7.,Garety PA,Trials,2017,2017/11/04,PMC5667466,,10.1186/s13063-017-2242-7,"BACKGROUND: Paranoia is one of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and is associated with significant distress and disruption to the person's life. Developing more effective and accessible psychological interventions for paranoia is a clinical priority. Our research team has approached this challenge in two main ways: firstly, by adopting an interventionist causal approach to increase effectiveness and secondly, by incorporating user-centred inclusive design methods to enhance accessibility and usability. Our resultant new digital intervention, SlowMo, intensively targets a reasoning style associated with paranoia, fast thinking, characterised by jumping to conclusions and belief inflexibility. It consists of an easy-to-use, enjoyable and memorable digital interface. An interactive web-based app facilitates delivery of face-to-face meetings which is then synchronised with an innovative mobile app for use in daily life. METHODS/DESIGN: We aim to test the clinical efficacy of SlowMo over 24 weeks to determine the mechanisms through which it reduces paranoia, and to identify participant characteristics that moderate its effectiveness. In a parallel-group randomised controlled trial, with 1:1 allocation, 360 participants with distressing persecutory beliefs will be independently randomised to receive either the SlowMo intervention added to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU, using randomly varying permuted blocks, stratified by paranoia severity and site. Research workers will be blind to therapy allocation. The primary outcome is paranoia severity over 24 weeks; our hypothesised mechanism of change is reasoning; moderators include negative symptoms and working memory; and secondary outcomes include wellbeing, quality of life, and service use. The accessibility, usability and acceptability of the digital platform will be assessed. DISCUSSION: SlowMo has been developed as the first blended digital therapy to target fears of harm from others through an inclusive design approach. In addition to testing its efficacy, this trial will add to our understanding of psychological mechanisms in paranoia. The study will examine the usability and adherence of a novel digital therapy, including an app for self-management, in a large sample of people affected by severe mental health difficulties.

Smartphones in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review,"Hamilton SJ, Mills B, Birch EM, Thompson SC.",BMC Cardiovasc Disord. 2018 Feb 7;18(1):25. doi: 10.1186/s12872-018-0764-x.,Hamilton SJ,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,2018,2018/02/09,PMC5803998,,10.1186/s12872-018-0764-x,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) and secondary prevention are effective components of evidence-based management for cardiac patients, resulting in improved clinical and behavioural outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing health delivery method that has the potential to enhance CR and heart failure management. We undertook a systematic review to assess the evidence around mHealth interventions for CR and heart failure management for service and patient outcomes, cost effectiveness with a view to how mHealth could be utilized for rural, remote and Indigenous cardiac patients. METHODS: A comprehensive search of databases using key terms was conducted for the years 2000 to August 2016 to identify randomised and non-randomised trials utilizing smartphone functionality and a model of care that included CR and heart failure management. Included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias and data extraction was undertaken by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Nine studies described a mix of mHealth interventions for CR (5 studies) and heart failure (4 studies) in the following categories: feasibility, utility and uptake studies; and randomised controlled trials. Studies showed that mHealth delivery for CR and heart failure management is feasible with high rates of participant engagement, acceptance, usage, and adherence. Moreover, mHealth delivery of CR was as effective as traditional centre-based CR (TCR) with significant improvement in quality of life. Hospital utilization for heart failure patients showed inconsistent reductions. There was limited inclusion of rural participants. CONCLUSION: Mobile health delivery has the potential to improve access to CR and heart failure management for patients unable to attend TCR programs. Feasibility testing of culturally appropriate mHealth delivery for CR and heart failure management is required in rural and remote settings with subsequent implementation and evaluation into local health care services."
Effect of Interactive eHealth Interventions on Improving Medication Adherence in Adults With Long-Term Medication: Systematic Review,"Pouls BPH, Vriezekolk JE, Bekker CL, Linn AJ, van Onzenoort HAW, Vervloet M, van Dulmen S, van den Bemt BJF.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Jan 8;23(1):e18901. doi: 10.2196/18901.,Pouls BPH,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/01/08,PMC7822716,,10.2196/18901,"BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes, making it a major priority in health care. eHealth provides an opportunity to offer medication adherence interventions with minimal effort from health care providers whose time and resources are limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (1) to evaluate effectiveness of recently developed and tested interactive eHealth (including mHealth) interventions on medication adherence in adult patients using long-term medication and (2) to describe strategies among effective interventions. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 2014 to July 2019 as well as reference lists and citations of included articles. Eligible studies fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized controlled trial with a usual care control group; (2) a total sample size of at least 50 adult patients using long-term medication; (3) applying an interactive eHealth intervention aimed at the patient or patient's caregiver; and (4) medication adherence as primary outcome. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Selection and quality assessment of studies were performed by 2 researchers (BP and BvdB or JV) independently. A best evidence synthesis was performed according to the Cochrane Back Review Group. RESULTS: Of the 9047 records screened, 22 randomized clinical trials were included reporting on 29 interventions. Most (21/29, 72%) interventions specified using a (mobile) phone for calling, SMS text messaging, or mobile apps. A majority of all interactive interventions (17/29) had a statistically significant effect on medication adherence (P<.05). Of these interventions, 9 had at least a small effect size (Cohen d >/= 0.2) and 3 showed strong odds for becoming adherent in the intervention group (odds ratio > 2.0). Our best evidence synthesis provided strong evidence for a positive effect of interventions using SMS text messages or interactive voice response, mobile app, and calls as mode of providing adherence tele-feedback. Intervention strategies ""to teach medication management skills,"" ""to improve health care quality by coordinating medication adherence care between professionals,"" and ""to facilitate communication or decision making between patients and health care providers"" also showed strong evidence for a positive effect. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this review supports the hypothesis that interactive eHealth interventions can be effective in improving medication adherence. Intervention strategies that improve patients' treatment involvement and their medication management skills are most promising and should be considered for implementation in practice."
"Efficacy of a smartphone-based intervention - ""Holidaily"" - promoting recovery behaviour in workers after a vacation: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","Smyth A, de Bloom J, Syrek C, Domin M, Janneck M, Reins JA, Lehr D.",BMC Public Health. 2020 Aug 26;20(1):1286. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-09354-5.,Smyth A,BMC Public Health,2020,2020/08/27,PMC7448331,,10.1186/s12889-020-09354-5,"BACKGROUND: While work-related rumination increases the risk of acute stressors developing into chronic load reactions and adverse health, mental detachment has been suggested as a way to interrupt this chain. Despite the importance of mentally detaching from work during leisure time, workers seem to struggle to disengage and, instead, experience the constant mental representation of work-related stressors, regardless of their absence. Those who struggle with work-related rumination could benefit from an easy-access intervention that fosters mental detachment by promoting recreational activities. Especially during vacations, workers appear to naturally engage in sufficient recovery activities; however, this beneficial behaviour is not sustained. The smartphone app-based intervention ""Holidaily"" promotes recovery behaviour and, thus, mental detachment from work with the intension of extending the beneficial effects of workers' vacations into their daily working life. METHODS: This randomised-controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the efficacy of ""Holidaily"". The Holidaily app is a German stand-alone program for mobile devices with either Android/iOS operating systems. The sample includes workers, who are awaiting to go on vacation and are randomly assigned to either the intervention (IG) or a waitlist-control group (CG). The IG receives two weeks pre-vacation access to Holidaily, while the CG receives access two weeks post-vacation. On a daily basis participants in the IG are provided with three options promoting recreational activities and beneficial recovery experiences. Online questionnaires are distributed to all participants at several timepoints. The primary outcome measure assesses participants' work-related rumination (Irritation Scale). A significant difference two weeks post-vacation is expected, favouring the IG. Secondary outcomes include symptoms of depression, insomnia severity, emotional exhaustion, thinking about work, recovery experiences, vacation specifics, work and personal characteristics. To help explain the intervention's effect, explorative analyses will investigate the mediation properties of the frequency of engaging in recreational activities and the moderation properties of Holidaily users' experiences. DISCUSSION: If successful, workers will maintain their recovery behaviour beyond their vacation into daily working life. Findings could, therefore, provide evidence for low-intensity interventions that could be very valuable from a public-health perspective. App-based interventions have greater reach; hence, more workers might access preventative tools to protect themselves from developing adverse health effects linked to work-related rumination. Further studies will still be needed to investigate whether the vacation phenomenon of ""lots of fun quickly gone"" can be defied and long-term benefits attained.

Effectiveness of eHealth interventions for the promotion of physical activity in older adults: a systematic review protocol,"Muellmann S, Forberger S, Möllers T, Zeeb H, Pischke CR.",Syst Rev. 2016 Mar 16;5:47. doi: 10.1186/s13643-016-0223-7.,Muellmann S,Syst Rev,2016,2016/03/18,PMC4793489,,10.1186/s13643-016-0223-7,"BACKGROUND: It is known that regular physical activity (PA) is associated with improvements in physical, psychological, cognitive, and functional health outcomes. The World Health Organization recommends 150 min of moderate exercise per week for older adults to achieve these health benefits. However, only 20-60 % of adults aged 60 years and above currently meet these recommendations for exercise. The widespread use of the internet and mobile phones among older adults may open new opportunities to promote PA in this population. Findings of previous reviews suggest that eHealth interventions are effective in promoting PA in adults of various ages. However, to date, none of these reviews have provided a differentiated picture of engagement in such interventions and effects on PA among older adults. Also, we are unaware of any studies comparing effects of participation in eHealth vs. traditional paper-and-pencil interventions on PA in this population. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the effectiveness of eHealth interventions promoting PA in older adults aged 55 years and above with either a non-eHealth PA intervention or a group that is not exposed to any intervention. METHODS: Eight electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PEI, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and OpenGrey) will be searched to identify experimental and quasi-experimental studies examining the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for PA promotion in adults aged 55 years and above. Two authors will independently select and review references, extract data, and assess the quality of the included studies by using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Disagreements between authors will be resolved by discussion involving a third author. If feasible, a meta-analysis will be conducted. Narrative synthesis using harvest plots will be performed, should a meta-analysis not be feasible. DISCUSSION: The proposed systematic review will be the first review that compares the effectiveness of eHealth interventions promoting PA in older adults aged 55 years and above with control groups exposed to a non-eHealth intervention or to no intervention. The results of this review will provide new information regarding the question whether eHealth interventions are an effective intervention vehicle for PA promotion in this population.

Methods Used to Evaluate mHealth Applications for Cardiovascular Disease: A Quasi-Systematic Scoping Review,"Holl F, Kircher J, Swoboda WJ, Schobel J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 Nov 23;18(23):12315. doi: 10.3390/ijerph182312315.,Holl F,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021,2021/12/10,PMC8656469,,10.3390/ijerph182312315,"In the face of demographic change and constantly increasing health care costs, health care system decision-makers face ever greater challenges. Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have the potential to combat this trend. However, in order to integrate mHealth apps into care structures, an evaluation of such apps is needed. In this paper, we focus on the criteria and methods of evaluating mHealth apps for cardiovascular disease and the implications for developing a widely applicable evaluation framework for mHealth interventions. Our aim is to derive substantiated patterns and starting points for future research by conducting a quasi-systematic scoping review of relevant peer-reviewed literature published in English or German between 2000 and 2021. We screened 4066 articles and identified n = 38 studies that met our inclusion criteria. The results of the data derived from these studies show that usability, motivation, and user experience were evaluated primarily using standardized questionnaires. Usage protocols and clinical outcomes were assessed primarily via laboratory diagnostics and quality-of-life questionnaires, and cost effectiveness was tested primarily based on economic measures. Based on these findings, we propose important considerations and elements for the development of a common evaluation framework for professional mHealth apps, including study designs, data collection tools, and perspectives."
Digital interventions for self-management of prediabetes: A scoping review,"Stowell M, Dobson R, Garner K, Baig M, Nehren N, Whittaker R.",PLoS One. 2024 May 10;19(5):e0303074. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0303074. eCollection 2024.,Stowell M,PLoS One,2024,2024/05/10,PMC11086829,,10.1371/journal.pone.0303074,"BACKGROUND: Rates of prediabetes, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, are increasing worldwide. Interventions for prediabetes mainly focus on lifestyle changes to diet and exercise. While these interventions are effective, they are often delivered face-to-face, which may pose a barrier to those with limited access to healthcare. Given the evidence for digital interventions addressing other noncommunicable diseases, these may also be effective for prediabetes self-management. The aim of this scoping review was to assess the breadth of evidence around digital interventions for prediabetes self-management. METHODS: We developed a targeted search strategy and relevant studies were identified through searches conducted in four bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Scopus). Published studies were eligible if they included a digital intervention to support adults aged 18+ with prediabetes self-management. Titles and abstracts were first screened for relevance by one researcher. Full texts of selected records were assessed against the review criteria independently by two researchers for inclusion in the final analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included, of which nine were randomised controlled trials. Most efficacy studies reported significant changes in at least one primary and/or secondary outcome, including participants' glycaemic control, weight loss and/or physical activity levels. About one-third of studies reported mixed outcomes or early significant outcomes that were not sustained at long-term follow-up. Interventions varied in length, digital modalities, and complexity. Delivery formats included text messages, mobile apps, virtually accessible dietitians/health coaches, online peer groups, and web-based platforms. Approximately half of studies assessed participant engagement/acceptability outcomes. CONCLUSION: Whilst the evidence here suggests that digital interventions to support prediabetes self-management are acceptable and have the potential to reduce one's risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, more research is needed to understand which interventions, and which components specifically, have the greatest reach to diverse populations, are most effective at promoting user engagement, and are most effective in the longer term."
Ecological Momentary Assessment and mHealth Interventions Among Men Who Have Sex With Men: Scoping Review,"Clark V, Kim SJ.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Aug 3;23(8):e27751. doi: 10.2196/27751.,Clark V,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/08/03,PMC8371491,,10.2196/27751,"BACKGROUND: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a research design that allows for the measurement of nearly instantaneous experiences within the participant's natural environment. Using EMA can help improve recall bias, ecological validity, and patient engagement while enhancing personalization and the ubiquity of interventions. People that can benefit from the use of EMA are men who have sex with men (MSM). Previous EMA studies have been successful in capturing patterns of depression, anxiety, substance use, and risky sexual behavior. These findings are directly relevant to MSM, who have high rates of each of these psychological and behavioral outcomes. Although there is a driving force behind the growing literature surrounding EMAs among MSM, no synthesizing reviews yet exist. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) synthesize the literature across fields on how EMA methods have been used among MSM, (2) better understand the feasibility and acceptability of EMA interventions among MSM, and (3) inform designs for future research studies on best evidence-based practices for EMA interventions. METHODS: Based on 4 library databases, we conducted a scoping review of EMAs used within interventions among MSM. The eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed studies conducted in the United States and the use of EMA methodology in an intervention for MSM. Modeling after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Compendium of Evidence-Based Interventions as the framework, we applied a typology that used 8 distinct review criteria, for example, sample size, design of the intervention, random assignment, design of the follow-up investigation, rate of retention, and rate of engagement. RESULTS: Our results (k=15, N=952) indicated a range of sample sizes; the smallest sample size was 12, while the largest sample size was 120. Of the 15 studies, 7 (47%) focused on outcomes related to substance use or outcomes related to psychological experiences. Of the 15 studies, 5 (33%) implemented an EMA intervention across 30 days. Of the 15 studies, 2 studies (13%) used random assignment, and 2 studies (13%) had quasi-experimental designs. Of the 15 studies, 10 studies (67%) reported acceptable retention rates greater than 70%. The outcomes that had event-contingent prompts (ie, prompts after engaging in substance use) were not as effective in engaging participants, with overall engagement rates as low as 37%. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic scoping review indicates strong evidence that the EMA methodology is both feasible and acceptable at high rates among MSM, especially, when examining psychological and behavioral outcomes such as negative or positive affect, risky sexual behavior, or substance use. Further research on optimal designs of EMA interventions for MSM is warranted."
An Integrated mHealth App for Smoking Cessation in Black Smokers With HIV: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Bizier A, Jones A, Businelle M, Kezbers K, Hoeppner BB, Giordano TP, Thai JM, Charles J, Montgomery A, Gallagher MW, Cheney MK, Zvolensky M, Garey L.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2024 Apr 24;13:e52090. doi: 10.2196/52090.,Bizier A,JMIR Res Protoc,2024,2024/04/24,PMC11079772,,10.2196/52090,"BACKGROUND: Black adults who smoke and have HIV experience immense stressors (eg, racial discrimination and HIV stigma) that impede smoking cessation success and perpetuate smoking-related health disparities. These stressors also place Black adults who smoke and have HIV at an increased risk of elevated interoceptive stress (eg, anxiety and uncomfortable bodily sensations) and smoking to manage symptoms. In turn, this population is more likely to smoke to manage interoceptive stress, which contributes to worse HIV-related outcomes in this group. However, no specialized treatment exists to address smoking cessation, interoceptive stress, and HIV management for Black smokers with HIV. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test a culturally adapted and novel mobile intervention that targets combustible cigarette smoking, HIV treatment engagement and adherence, and anxiety sensitivity (a proxy for difficulty and responsivity to interoceptive stress) among Black smokers with HIV (ie, Mobile Anxiety Sensitivity Program for Smoking and HIV [MASP+]). Various culturally tailored components of the app are being evaluated for their ability to help users quit smoking, manage physiological stress, and improve health care management. METHODS: This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial in which Black combustible cigarette smokers with HIV (N=72) are being recruited and randomly assigned to use either (1) the National Cancer Institute's QuitGuide app or (2) MASP+. Study procedures include a web-based prescreener; active intervention period for 6 weeks; smartphone-based assessments, including daily app-based ecological momentary assessments for 6 weeks (4 ecological momentary assessments each day); a video-based qualitative interview using Zoom Video Communications software at week 6 for participants in all study conditions; and smartphone-based follow-up assessments at 0, 1, 2 (quit date), 3, 4, 5, 6, and 28 weeks postbaseline (26 weeks postquitting date). RESULTS: Primary outcomes include biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence of abstinence, HIV-related quality of life, use of antiretroviral therapy, and HIV care appointment adherence at 26 weeks postquitting date. Qualitative data are also being collected and assessed to obtain feedback that will guide further tailoring of app content and evaluation of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will determine whether the MASP+ app serves as a successful aid for combustible cigarette smoking cessation, HIV treatment engagement, and physiological stress outcomes among Black people with HIV infection. If successful, this study will provide evidence for the efficacy of a new means of addressing major mental and physical health difficulties for this high-risk population. If the results are promising, the data from this study will be used to update and tailor the MASP+ app for testing in a fully powered randomized controlled trial that will evaluate its efficacy in real-world behavioral health and social service settings.

While medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with Suboxone remains one of the more efficacious treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD), approximately 40% of people receiving Suboxone for outpatient MAT for OUD (MOUD) relapse within the first 6 months of treatment. We developed the smartphone app-based intervention OptiMAT as an adjunctive intervention to improve MOUD outcomes. The aims of this study are to (1) evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive OptiMAT use in reducing opioid misuse among people receiving MOUD and (2) evaluate the role of specific OptiMAT features in reducing opioid misuse, including the use of GPS-driven just-in-time intervention. METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled trial of adults receiving outpatient MOUD in the greater Little Rock AR area. Participants are English-speaking adults ages 18 or older recently enrolled in outpatient MOUD at one of our participating study clinics. Participants will be allocated via 1:1 randomized block design to (1) MOUD with adjunctive use of OptiMAT (MOUD+OptiMAT) or (2) MOUD without OptiMAT (MOUD-only). Our blinded research statistician will evaluate differences between the two groups in opioid misuse (as determined by quantitative urinalysis conducted by clinical lab staff blinded to group membership) during the 6-months following study enrolment. Secondary analyses will evaluate if OptiMAT-usage patterns within the MOUD+OptiMAT group predict opioid misuse or continued abstinence. DISCUSSION: This study will test if adjunctive use of OptiMAT improve MOUD outcomes. Study findings could lead to expansion of OptiMAT into rural clinical settings, and the identification of OptiMAT features which best predict positive clinical outcome could lead to refinement of this and similar smartphone app-based interventions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conceptualize a theory-based and evidence-based mHealth intervention called SMARTFAMILY (SF) that targets physical activity and healthy eating in a collective family-based setting. Subsequently, the app will be refined and re-evaluated to analyze additional effects of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and gamification features. METHODS: A smartphone app based on behavior change theories and behavior change techniques was developed and implemented and will be evaluated with family members individually and cooperatively (SF trial). Existing evidence and gained results were used to refine and will be used to re-evaluate the app (SF2.0 trial). Both trials are cluster randomized controlled trials with 3 measurement occasions. The intervention group uses the app for 3 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group receives no treatment. Baseline measurements (T(0)) and postintervention measurements (T(1)) include physical activity (ie, self-reported and accelerometry) and healthy eating measurements (ie, self-reported fruit and vegetable intake) as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes (ie, self-reported) are intrinsic motivation, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and the family health climate, complemented by an intentional measure in SF2.0. Four weeks following T(1), a follow-up assessment (T(2)) is completed by the participants, consisting of all questionnaire items to assess the stability of the intervention effects. Mixed-method analysis of covariance will be used to calculate the primary intervention effects (ie, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) while controlling for covariates, including family health climate, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation. RESULTS: This study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and ethically approved by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For both trials, it is hypothesized that the apps will positively influence physical activity and healthy eating in the whole family. Furthermore, SF2.0 is expected to produce stronger effects (ie, higher effect sizes) compared to SF. SF app development and piloting are completed. Data acquisition for the SF trial is terminated and discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF2.0 app development and piloting are completed, while data acquisition is ongoing. Participant recruitment for the SF 2.0 trial started in February 2020. The results for SF are expected to be published in mid-2021, and the results of SF2.0 are expected to be published in mid-2022. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it is hypothesized that targeting the whole family will facilitate behavior change at the individual level and the family level, as the implemented strategies address changes in daily family life. Furthermore, subsequent app development (SF2.0) with supplementary addition of motivation-enhancing features and a JITAI approach is expected to enhance positive intervention effects.

WeChat-based intervention to support breastfeeding for Chinese mothers: protocol of a randomised controlled trial,"Tang L, Lee AH, Binns CW, Duan L, Liu Y, Li C.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2020 Nov 19;20(1):300. doi: 10.1186/s12911-020-01322-8.,Tang L,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,2020,2020/11/20,PMC7676472,,10.1186/s12911-020-01322-8,"BACKGROUND: Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life is the optimal way to feed infants. However, recent studies suggest that exclusive breastfeeding rates in China remain low and are well below the recommended target. There has been evidence that a lack of awareness of, or exposure to, breastfeeding information is associated with poor breastfeeding practices. WeChat, the most widely used social networking platform in China, has shown some potential to promote health behaviours. We thus hypothesised that a breastfeeding intervention program delivered via WeChat would achieve at least a 10% increase in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence at 6 months compared to the control group. METHODS: A two-arm, parallel, multicentre randomised controlled trial of 1000 pregnant women will be conducted at four maternity hospitals of Chengdu, China. Eligible women who consent to participate in the trial will be recruited at 28-30 weeks of gestation, and randomly allocated to either the intervention group (participants receive breastfeeding-related information from WeChat) or the control group (participants receive non-breastfeeding information from WeChat) using a central randomisation system on a 1:1 ratio at each participating site. The primary outcomes are exclusive breastfeeding rate and full breastfeeding rate at 6 months postpartum. All randomised participants will be included in the outcome analyses with missing data being imputed based on the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Multilevel mixed regression models will be used in the primary analyses to assess the effectiveness of intervention program on the breastfeeding rates. DISCUSSION: This trial uses the most widely used social media program as a means of delivering messages to mothers to increase exclusive breastfeeding in China. Increasing exclusive breastfeeding will contribute to meeting the health and environmental goals of the Sustainable Development Guidelines. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04499404.

Cost-effectiveness of the mobile application TCApp combined with face-to-face CBT treatment compared to face-to-face CBT treatment alone for patients with an eating disorder: study protocol of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial,"Anastasiadou D, Lupiañez-Villanueva F, Faulí C, Arcal Cunillera J, Serrano-Troncoso E.",BMC Psychiatry. 2018 May 2;18(1):118. doi: 10.1186/s12888-018-1664-4.,Anastasiadou D,BMC Psychiatry,2018,2018/05/03,PMC5930846,,10.1186/s12888-018-1664-4,"BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of the existing apps for people with eating disorders (EDs) is not clear. The TCApp has been specifically developed for people with EDs, is based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Treatment (CBT) and allows a bidirectional link between the patient and the therapist. The objectives of the study are, first, to assess the clinical efficacy of a combined intervention for Eating Disorders (EDs) that includes an online intervention through the TCApp plus standard face-to-face CBT in comparison to standard face-to-face CBT alone, and second, to examine the cost-effectiveness of the TCApp and identify potential predicting, moderating and mediating variables that promote or hinder the implementation of the TCApp in ED units in Spain. METHODS: The study methodology is that of a randomised controlled trial combining qualitative and quantitative methods, with a 6-month follow-up. Approximately 250 patients over 12 years old with a diagnosis of an ED from several ED units in Spain will be randomised to one of two different conditions. Participants, their caregivers, healthcare professionals and technical staff involved in the development and maintenance of the application will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and at 6 months follow-up (T2). Primary outcome measures will include ED symptomatology while secondary measures will include general psychopathology and quality of life for patients, quality of life and caregiving experience for family caregivers and adoption-related variables for all participants involved, such as perceived usability, user's satisfaction and technology acceptance. For the cost-effectiveness analysis, we will assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); total societal cost will be estimated using costs to patients and the health plan, and other related costs. DISCUSSION: The study will provide an important advance in the treatment of EDs; in the long term, it is expected to improve the quality of patient care and the treatment efficacy and to reduce waiting lists as well as direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of EDs in Spain.

Molehill Mountain feasibility study: Protocol for a non-randomised pilot trial of a novel app-based anxiety intervention for autistic people,"Oakley B, Boatman C, Doswell S, Dittner A, Clarke A, Ozsivadjian A, Kent R, Judd A, Baldoza S, Hearn A, Murphy D, Simonoff E; Molehill Mountain Advisory Group.",PLoS One. 2023 Jul 5;18(7):e0286792. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0286792. eCollection 2023.,Oakley B,PLoS One,2023,2023/07/05,PMC10321642,,10.1371/journal.pone.0286792,"Up to 50% of autistic people experience co-occurring anxiety, which significantly impacts their quality of life. Consequently, developing new interventions (and/ or adapting existing ones) that improve anxiety has been indicated as a priority for clinical research and practice by the autistic community. Despite this, there are very few effective, evidence-based therapies available to autistic people that target anxiety; and those that are available (e.g., autism adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; CBT) can be challenging to access. Thus, the current study will provide an early-stage proof of concept for the feasibility and acceptability of a novel app-based therapeutic approach that has been developed with, and adapted for, autistic people to support them in managing anxiety using UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended adapted CBT approaches. This paper describes the design and methodology of an ethically approved (22/LO/0291) ongoing non-randomised pilot trial that aims to enrol approximately 100 participants aged >/=16-years with an existing autism diagnosis and mild-to-severe self-reported anxiety symptoms (trial registration NCT05302167). Participants will be invited to engage with a self-guided app-based intervention-'Molehill Mountain'. Primary (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and secondary outcomes (medication/ service use and Goal Attainment Scaling) will be assessed at baseline (Week 2 +/- 2), endpoint (Week 15 +/- 2) and three follow-ups (Weeks 24, 32 and 41 +/- 4). Participants will also be invited to complete an app acceptability survey/ interview at the study endpoint. Analyses will address: 1) app acceptability/ useability and feasibility (via survey/ interview and app usage data); and 2) target population, performance of outcome measures and ideal timing/ duration of intervention (via primary/ secondary outcome measures and survey/ interview)-with both objectives further informed by a dedicated stakeholder advisory group. The evidence from this study will inform the future optimisation and implementation of Molehill Mountain in a randomised-controlled trial, to provide a novel tool that can be accessed easily by autistic adults and may improve mental health outcomes."
Understanding Adolescent and Young Adult 6-Mercaptopurine Adherence and mHealth Engagement During Cancer Treatment: Protocol for Ecological Momentary Assessment,"Psihogios AM, Rabbi M, Ahmed A, McKelvey ER, Li Y, Laurenceau JP, Hunger SP, Fleisher L, Pai AL, Schwartz LA, Murphy SA, Barakat LP.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Oct 22;10(10):e32789. doi: 10.2196/32789.,Psihogios AM,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/10/22,PMC8571686,,10.2196/32789,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer demonstrate suboptimal oral chemotherapy adherence, increasing their risk of cancer relapse. It is unclear how everyday time-varying contextual factors (eg, mood) affect their adherence, stalling the development of personalized mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Poor engagement is also a challenge across mHealth trials; an effective adherence intervention must be engaging to promote uptake. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to determine the temporal associations between daily contextual factors and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) adherence and explore the proximal impact of various engagement strategies on ecological momentary assessment survey completion. METHODS: At the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, AYAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma who are prescribed prolonged maintenance chemotherapy that includes daily oral 6-MP are eligible, along with their matched caregivers. Participants will use an ecological momentary assessment app called ADAPTS (Adherence Assessments and Personalized Timely Support)-a version of an open-source app that was modified for AYAs with cancer through a user-centered process-and complete surveys in bursts over 6 months. Theory-informed engagement strategies will be microrandomized to estimate the causal effects on proximal survey completion. RESULTS: With funding from the National Cancer Institute and institutional review board approval, of the proposed 30 AYA-caregiver dyads, 60% (18/30) have been enrolled; of the 18 enrolled, 15 (83%) have completed the study so far. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol represents an important first step toward prescreening tailoring variables and engagement components for a just-in-time adaptive intervention designed to promote both 6-MP adherence and mHealth engagement.

Framework for the Design Engineering and Clinical Implementation and Evaluation of mHealth Apps for Sleep Disturbance: Systematic Review,"Aji M, Gordon C, Stratton E, Calvo RA, Bartlett D, Grunstein R, Glozier N.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Feb 17;23(2):e24607. doi: 10.2196/24607.,Aji M,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/02/17,PMC7929739,,10.2196/24607,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer a scalable option for treating sleep disturbances at a population level. However, there is a lack of clarity about the development and evaluation of evidence-based mHealth apps. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to provide evidence for the design engineering and clinical implementation and evaluation of mHealth apps for sleep disturbance. METHODS: A systematic search of studies published from the inception of databases through February 2020 was conducted using 5 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and CINAHL). RESULTS: A total of 6015 papers were identified using the search strategy. After screening, 15 papers were identified that examined the design engineering and clinical implementation and evaluation of 8 different mHealth apps for sleep disturbance. Most of these apps delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I, n=4) or modified CBT-I (n=2). Half of the apps (n=4) identified adopting user-centered design or multidisciplinary teams in their design approach. Only 3 papers described user and data privacy. End-user acceptability and engagement were the most frequently assessed implementation metrics. Only 1 app had available evidence assessing all 4 implementation metrics (ie, acceptability, engagement, usability, and adherence). Most apps were prototype versions (n=5), with few matured apps. A total of 6 apps had supporting papers that provided a quantitative evaluation of clinical outcomes, but only 1 app had a supporting, adequately powered randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review to synthesize and examine evidence for the design engineering and clinical implementation and evaluation of mHealth apps for sleep disturbance. The minimal number of apps with published evidence for design engineering and clinical implementation and evaluation contrasts starkly with the number of commercial sleep apps available. Moreover, there appears to be no standardization and consistency in the use of best practice design approaches and implementation assessments, along with very few rigorous efficacy evaluations. To facilitate the development of successful and evidence-based apps for sleep disturbance, we developed a high-level framework to guide researchers and app developers in the end-to-end process of app development and evaluation."
EHealth Technologies in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review,"Jackson BD, Gray K, Knowles SR, De Cruz P.",J Crohns Colitis. 2016 Sep;10(9):1103-21. doi: 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw059. Epub 2016 Feb 29.,Jackson BD,J Crohns Colitis,2016,2016/03/02,,,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjw059,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Electronic-health technologies (eHealth) such as Web-based interventions, virtual clinics, smart-phone applications, and telemedicine are being used to manage patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to: (1) Evaluate the impact of eHealth technologies on conventional clinical indices and patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) in IBD; (2) assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of using eHealth technologies to facilitate the self-management of individuals with IBD, and; (3) provide recommendations for their design and optimal use for patient care. METHODS: Relevant publications were identified via a literature search, and 17 publications were selected based on predefined quality parameters. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials and nine observational studies utilizing eHealth technologies in IBD were identified. Compared with standard outpatient-led care, eHealth technologies have led to improvements in: Relapse duration [(n = 1) 18 days vs 77 days, p < 0.001]; disease activity (n = 2); short-term medication adherence (n = 3); quality of life (n = 4); IBD knowledge (n = 2); healthcare costs (n = 4); the number of acute visits to the outpatient clinic due to IBD symptoms (n = 1), and; facilitating the remote management of up to 20% of an IBD cohort (n = 2). Methodological shortcomings of eHealth studies include heterogeneity of outcome measures, lack of clinician/patient input, lack of validation against conventional clinical indices and PROs, and limited cost-benefit analyses. CONCLUSIONS: EHealth technologies have the potential for promoting self-management and reducing the impact of the growing burden of IBD on health care resource utilization. A theoretical framework should be applied to the development, implementation, and evaluation of eHealth interventions."
mHealth Solutions for Perinatal Mental Health: Scoping Review and Appraisal Following the mHealth Index and Navigation Database Framework,"Spadaro B, Martin-Key NA, Funnell E, Bahn S.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 Jan 17;10(1):e30724. doi: 10.2196/30724.,Spadaro B,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/01/17,PMC8804959,,10.2196/30724,"BACKGROUND: The ever-increasing pressure on health care systems has resulted in the underrecognition of perinatal mental disorders. Digital mental health tools such as apps could provide an option for accessible perinatal mental health screening and assessment. However, there is a lack of information regarding the availability and features of perinatal app options. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the current state of diagnostic and screening apps for perinatal mental health available on the Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS) and to review their features following the mHealth Index and Navigation Database framework. METHODS: Following a scoping review approach, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store were systematically searched to identify perinatal mental health assessment apps. A total of 14 apps that met the inclusion criteria were downloaded and reviewed in a standardized manner using the mHealth Index and Navigation Database framework. The framework comprised 107 questions, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of app origin, functionality, engagement features, security, and clinical use. RESULTS: Most apps were developed by for-profit companies (n=10), followed by private individuals (n=2) and trusted health care companies (n=2). Out of the 14 apps, 3 were available only on Android devices, 4 were available only on iOS devices, and 7 were available on both platforms. Approximately one-third of the apps (n=5) had been updated within the last 180 days. A total of 12 apps offered the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in its original version or in rephrased versions. Engagement, input, and output features included reminder notifications, connections to therapists, and free writing features. A total of 6 apps offered psychoeducational information and references. Privacy policies were available for 11 of the 14 apps, with a median Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level of 12.3. One app claimed to be compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act standards and 2 apps claimed to be compliant with General Data Protection Regulation. Of the apps that could be accessed in full (n=10), all appeared to fulfill the claims stated in their description. Only 1 app referenced a relevant peer-reviewed study. All the apps provided a warning for use, highlighting that the mental health assessment result should not be interpreted as a diagnosis or as a substitute for medical care. Only 3 apps allowed users to export or email their mental health test results. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that there are opportunities to improve perinatal mental health assessment apps. To this end, we recommend focusing on the development and validation of more comprehensive assessment tools, ensuring data protection and safety features are adequate for the intended app use, and improving data sharing features between users and health care professionals for timely support."
The impact of smartphone app-based interventions on adolescents' dietary intake: a systematic review and evaluation of equity factor reporting in intervention studies,"Schaafsma HN, Jantzi HA, Seabrook JA, McEachern LW, Burke SM, Irwin JD, Gilliland JA.",Nutr Rev. 2024 Mar 11;82(4):467-486. doi: 10.1093/nutrit/nuad058.,Schaafsma HN,Nutr Rev,2024,2023/06/18,PMC10925905,,10.1093/nutrit/nuad058,"CONTEXT: Adolescence is a critical stage for improving nutrition. The popularity of smartphones makes them an ideal platform for administering interventions to adolescents. A systematic review has yet to assess the impact of smartphone app-based interventions exclusively on adolescents' dietary intake. Furthermore, despite the impact of equity factors on dietary intake and the claim for mobile health of increased accessibility, there is minimal research on the reporting of equity factors in the evaluation of smartphone app-based nutrition-intervention research. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examines the effectiveness of smartphone app-based interventions on adolescents' dietary intake and the frequency with which equity factors and statistical analyses specific to equity factors are reported in these intervention studies. DATA SOURCES: Databases (ie, Scopus, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Cochrane Central Register for Randomized Control Trials) were searched for studies published from January 2008 to October 2022. Smartphone app-based intervention studies that were nutrition focused, evaluated at least 1 dietary intake variable, and included participants with a mean age between 10 and 19 years were included. All geographic locations were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Study characteristics, intervention results, and reported equity factors were extracted. Because of the heterogeneity of dietary outcomes, findings were reported as a narrative synthesis. CONCLUSION: In total, 3087 studies were retrieved, 14 of which met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies reported a statistically significant improvement in at least 1 dietary outcome because of the intervention. Reporting of at least 1 equity factor across articles' Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections was minimal (n = 5), and statistical analyses specific to equity factors were rare, occurring in only 4 of the 14 included studies. Future interventions should include a measurement of intervention adherence and report the impact of equity factors on the effectiveness and applicability of interventions for equity-deserving groups."

MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched from September 1, 2016 through August 31, 2021. Our scoping review identified 25 publications that utilized synchronous and asynchronous mHealth-enabled RPM in pediatric asthma, either involving mobile applications or via individual devices. The last three years has seen the development of evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and participatory mHealth interventions. The quality of the studies has been improving, such that 40% of included study reports were randomized controlled trials. In conclusion, there exists high-quality evidence on mHealth-enabled RPM in pediatric asthma, warranting future systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of the benefits of such RPM."

How a woman adapts to these changes can affect her quality of life and psychological well-being. The literature indicates that pregnant women commonly experience psychological symptoms, with anxiety, stress, and depression being among the most frequent. Hence, promoting a healthy lifestyle focused on women's psychological well-being is crucial. Recently developed digital solutions have assumed a crucial role in supporting psychological well-being in physiologically pregnant women. Therefore, the need becomes evident for the development and implementation of digital solutions, such as a virtual coach implemented in a smartphone, as a support for the psychological well-being of pregnant women who do not present psychological and psychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of a mindfulness-based mobile app. The primary objective is to explore the feasibility of using a virtual coach, Maia, developed within the TreC Mamma app to promote women's psychological well-being during pregnancy through a psychoeducational module based on mindfulness. Finally, through the delivery of this module, the level of psychological well-being will be explored as a secondary objective. METHODS: This is a proof-of-concept study in which a small sample (N=50) is sufficient to achieve the intended purposes. Recruitment will occur within the group of pregnant women belonging to the pregnancy care services of the Trento Azienda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari di Trento. The convenience sampling method will be used. Maia will interact with the participating women for 8 weeks, starting from weeks 24 and 26 of pregnancy. Specifically, there will be 2 sessions per week, which the woman can choose, to allow more flexibility toward her needs. RESULTS: The psychoeducational pathway is expected to lead to significant results in terms of usability and engagement in women's interactions with Maia. Furthermore, it is anticipated that there will be improvements in psychological well-being and overall quality of life. The analysis of the data collected in this study will be mainly descriptive, orientated toward assessing the achievement of the study objectives. CONCLUSIONS: Literature has shown that women preferred web-based support during the perinatal period, suggesting that implementing digital interventions can overcome barriers to social stigma and asking for help. Maia can be a valuable resource for regular psychoeducational support for women during pregnancy. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): RR1-10.2196/53890."
Digital Health Promotion and Prevention in Settings: Scoping Review,"Stark AL, Geukes C, Dockweiler C.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Jan 28;24(1):e21063. doi: 10.2196/21063.,Stark AL,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/01/28,PMC8838600,,10.2196/21063,"BACKGROUND: Digital technologies are increasingly integrating into people's daily living environments such as schools, sport clubs, and health care facilities. These settings play a crucial role for health promotion and prevention because they affect the health of their members, as the World Health Organization has declared. Implementing digital health promotion and prevention in settings offers the opportunity to reach specific target groups, lower the costs of implementation, and improve the health of the population. Currently, there is a lack of scientific evidence that reviews the research on digital health promotion and prevention in settings. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to provide an overview of research targeting digital health promotion and primary prevention in settings. It assesses the range of scientific literature regarding outcomes such as applied technology, targeted setting, and area of health promotion or prevention, as well as identifies research gaps. METHODS: The scoping review was conducted following the Levac, Colquhoun, and O'Brien framework. We searched scientific databases and gray literature for articles on digital setting-based health promotion and prevention published from 2010 to January 2020. We included empirical and nonempirical publications in English or German and excluded secondary or tertiary prevention and health promotion at the workplace. RESULTS: From 8888 records, the search resulted in 200 (2.25%) included publications. We identified a huge diversity of literature regarding digital setting-based health promotion and prevention. The variety of technology types extends from computer- and web-based programs to mobile devices (eg, smartphone apps) and telemonitoring devices (sensors). We found analog, digital, and blended settings in which digital health promotion and prevention takes place. The most frequent analog settings were schools (39/200, 19.5%) and neighborhoods or communities (24/200, 12%). Social media apps were also included because in some studies they were defined as a (digital) setting. They accounted for 31.5% (63/200) of the identified settings. The most commonly focused areas of health promotion and prevention were physical activity (81/200, 40.5%), nutrition (45/200, 22.5%), and sexual health (34/200, 17%). Most of the interventions combined several health promotion or prevention methods, including environmental change; providing information, social support, training, or incentives; and monitoring. Finally, we found that the articles mostly reported on behavioral rather than structural health promotion and prevention. CONCLUSIONS: The research field of digital health promotion and prevention in settings is heterogeneous. At the same time, we identified research gaps regarding the absence of valid definitions of relevant terms (eg, digital settings) and the lack of literature on structural health promotion and prevention in settings. Therefore, it remains unclear how digital technologies can contribute to structural (or organizational) changes in settings. More research is needed to successfully implement digital technologies to achieve health promotion and prevention in settings."
Evaluating the Development Processes of Consumer mHealth Interventions for Chronic Condition Self-management: A Scoping Review,"Woods L, Duff J, Cummings E, Walker K.",Comput Inform Nurs. 2019 Jul;37(7):373-385. doi: 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000528.,Woods L,Comput Inform Nurs,2019,2019/05/29,,,10.1097/CIN.0000000000000528,"Innovative, patient-centered mHealth interventions have the potential to help with the burden of chronic conditions. This review aims to describe the development of consumer mHealth interventions for chronic condition self-management. A scoping review methodology was used to search medical databases for eligible reports, published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, that provided information on consumer mHealth interventions for respiratory disease, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Twenty-one reports were included, representing the development of 14 mHealth interventions. Most were developed collaboratively, using user-centered and participatory design processes. Predesign work involved a thorough needs assessment, and redesign processes were described as iterative, engaging with usability testing and design improvements. Tensions from competing priorities between patients and healthcare professionals were uncovered, with the intention to develop a useful product for the patient while ensuring clinical relevance. This review provides clear evidence that consumer mHealth interventions are developed inconsistently even when engaging with participatory or user-centered design principles, sometimes without direct involvement of patients themselves. Further, the incomplete description of the development processes presents challenges to furthering the knowledge base as healthcare professionals need timely access to quality information on mHealth products in order to recommend safe, effective consumer mHealth interventions."
"Effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, self-management-oriented lifestyle intervention in community residents: protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial","Yang S, Yu B, Liao K, Qiao X, Fan Y, Li M, Hu Y, Chen J, Ye T, Cai C, Ma C, Pang T, Huang Z, Jia P, Reinhardt JD, Dou Q.",BMC Public Health. 2024 Jan 2;24(1):32. doi: 10.1186/s12889-023-17073-w.,Yang S,BMC Public Health,2024,2024/01/03,PMC10763380,,10.1186/s12889-023-17073-w,"BACKGROUND: Healthy lifestyles are crucial for preventing chronic diseases. Nonetheless, approximately 90% of Chinese community residents regularly engage in at least one unhealthy lifestyle. Mobile smart devices-based health interventions (mHealth) that incorporate theoretical frameworks regarding behavioral change in interaction with the environment may provide an appealing and cost-effective approach for promoting sustainable adaptations of healthier lifestyles. We designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, and self-management-oriented lifestyles (3SLIFE) intervention, to promote healthy lifestyles among Chinese community residents. METHODS: This two-arm, parallel, cluster-RCT with a 6-month intervention and 6-month follow-up period foresees to randomize a total of 20 communities/villages from 4 townships in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention or control. Within these communities, a total of at least 256 community residents will be enrolled. The experimental group will receive a multi-level intervention based on the socioecological model supplemented with a multi-dimensional empowerment approach. The control group will receive information only. The primary outcome is the reduction of modifiable unhealthy lifestyles at six months, including smoking, excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, unbalanced diet, and overweight/obesity. A reduction by one unhealthy behavior measured with the Healthy Lifestyle Index Score (HLIS) will be considered favorable. Secondary outcomes include reduction of specific unhealthy lifestyles at 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months, and mental health outcomes such as depression measured with PHQ-9, social outcomes such as social support measured with the modified Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, clinical outcomes such as obesity, and biomedical outcomes such as the development of gut microbiota. Data will be analyzed with mixed effects generalized linear models with family and link function determined by outcome distribution and accounting for clustering of participants in communities. DISCUSSION: This study will provide evidence concerning the effect of a mHealth intervention that incorporates a behavioral change theoretical framework on cultivating and maintaining healthy lifestyles in community residents. The study will provide insights into research on and application of similar mHealth intervention strategies to promote healthy lifestyles in community populations and settings.

Effectiveness of mHealth App-Based Interventions for Increasing Physical Activity and Improving Physical Fitness in Children and Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Wang JW, Zhu Z, Shuling Z, Fan J, Jin Y, Gao ZL, Chen WD, Li X.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2024 Apr 30;12:e51478. doi: 10.2196/51478.,Wang JW,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2024,2024/04/30,PMC11094610,,10.2196/51478,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced physical activity (PA) levels and increased sedentary behavior (SB), which can lead to worsening physical fitness (PF). Children and adolescents may benefit from mobile health (mHealth) apps to increase PA and improve PF. However, the effectiveness of mHealth app-based interventions and potential moderators in this population are not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review and analyze the effectiveness of mHealth app-based interventions in promoting PA and improving PF and identify potential moderators of the efficacy of mHealth app-based interventions in children and adolescents. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library databases until December 25, 2023, to conduct this meta-analysis. We included articles with intervention groups that investigated the effects of mHealth-based apps on PA and PF among children and adolescents. Due to high heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify potential influences impacting effect sizes. RESULTS: We included 28 RCTs with a total of 5643 participants. In general, the risk of bias of included studies was low. Our findings showed that mHealth app-based interventions significantly increased total PA (TPA; standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.45; P<.001), reduced SB (SMD -0.97, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.28; P=.006) and BMI (weighted mean difference -0.31 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.60 to -0.01 kg/m(2); P=.12), and improved muscle strength (SMD 1.97, 95% CI 0.09-3.86; P=.04) and agility (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.10; P=.006). However, mHealth app-based interventions insignificantly affected moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA; SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.25; P<.001), waist circumference (weighted mean difference 0.38 cm, 95% CI -1.28 to 2.04 cm; P=.65), muscular power (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.10; P=.81), cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.05; P=.11), muscular endurance (SMD 0.47, 95% CI -0.08 to 1.02; P=.10), and flexibility (SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.41; P=.58). Subgroup analyses and meta-regression showed that intervention duration was associated with TPA and MVPA, and age and types of intervention was associated with BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that mHealth app-based interventions may yield small-to-large beneficial effects on TPA, SB, BMI, agility, and muscle strength in children and adolescents. Furthermore, age and intervention duration may correlate with the higher effectiveness of mHealth app-based interventions. However, due to the limited number and quality of included studies, the aforementioned conclusions require validation through additional high-quality research.

The primary objective is to test the compliance (user engagement) with the monitoring solution. Secondary objectives include recording clinically relevant subjective and objective measures collected through the digital solution. METHODS: This is a monocentric pilot study taking place in Bangor, Wales, United Kingdom. We plan to enroll up to 100 adult survivors of cancer not receiving toxic anticancer treatment, who will provide self-reported behavioral data recorded via a dedicated app and validated questionnaires and objective data automatically collected by a paired smartwatch over 16 weeks. The participants will continue with their normal routine surveillance care for their cancer. The primary end point is feasibility (eg, mHealth monitoring acceptability). Composite secondary end points include clinically relevant patient-reported outcome measures (eg, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System score) and objective physiological measures (eg, step counts). This trial received a favorable ethical review in May 2023 (Integrated Research Application System 301068). RESULTS: This study is part of an array of pilots within a European Union funded project, entitled ""GATEKEEPER,"" conducted at different sites across Europe and covering various chronic diseases. Study accrual is anticipated to commence in January 2024 and continue until June 2024. It is hypothesized that mHealth monitoring will be feasible in survivors of cancer; specifically, at least 50% (50/100) of the participants will engage with the app at least once a week in 8 of the 16 study weeks. CONCLUSIONS: In a population with potentially complex clinical needs, this pilot study will test the feasibility of multidimensional remote monitoring of patient-reported outcomes and physiological parameters. Satisfactory compliance with the use of the app and smartwatch, whether confirmed or infirmed through this study, will be propaedeutic to the development of innovative mHealth interventions in survivors of cancer.

The use of eHealth to promote physical activity in cancer survivors: a systematic review,"Haberlin C, O'Dwyer T, Mockler D, Moran J, O'Donnell DM, Broderick J.",Support Care Cancer. 2018 Oct;26(10):3323-3336. doi: 10.1007/s00520-018-4305-z. Epub 2018 Jun 16.,Haberlin C,Support Care Cancer,2018,2018/06/18,,,10.1007/s00520-018-4305-z,"PURPOSE: Achieving adequate levels of physical activity (PA) and avoiding sedentary behaviour are particularly important in cancer survivors. eHealth, which includes, but is not limited to, the delivery of health information through Internet and mobile technologies, is an emerging concept in healthcare which may present opportunities to improve PA in cancer survivors. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the effects of eHealth in the promotion of PA among cancer survivors. METHODS: Suitable articles were searched using PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings. Articles were included if they described an eHealth intervention designed to improve PA in cancer survivors. Two reviewers screened studies for inclusion. RESULTS: In total, 1065 articles were considered. Ten studies met eligibility criteria. A variety of platforms designed to increase PA were described in these studies: web application (app) (n = 5), web and mobile application (n = 2), mobile app (n = 1), website only (n = 1), e-mail based (n = 1). All studies measured PA using self-report outcome measures with the exception of one study which measured steps using a Fitbit. Meta-analysis was not performed because of variations in study design and interventions. All studies reported improvements in PA, with 8/10 studies reporting statistically significant changes. CONCLUSION: The use of eHealth to promote PA in cancer survivors is a relatively new concept, which is supported by the recent emergent evidence described in this review. eHealth shows promise as a means of promoting and increasing daily PA, but further high-quality, longer term studies are needed to establish the feasibility and effectiveness of eHealth platforms aimed at that goal."
An App-Based Just-in-Time Adaptive Self-management Intervention for Care Partners (CareQOL): Protocol for a Pilot Trial,"Carlozzi NE, Choi SW, Wu Z, Miner JA, Lyden AK, Graves C, Wang J, Sen S.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Dec 9;10(12):e32842. doi: 10.2196/32842.,Carlozzi NE,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/12/10,PMC8704108,,10.2196/32842,"BACKGROUND: Care partners (ie, informal family caregivers) of individuals with health problems face considerable physical and emotional stress, often with a substantial negative impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of both care partners and care recipients. Given that these individuals are often overwhelmed by their caregiving responsibilities, low-burden self-management interventions are needed to support care partners to ensure better patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to describe an intensive data collection protocol that involves the delivery of a personalized just-in-time adaptive intervention that incorporates passive mobile sensor data feedback (sleep and activity data from a Fitbit [Fitbit LLC]) and real time self-reporting of HRQOL via a study-specific app called CareQOL (University of Michigan) to provide personalized feedback via app alerts. METHODS: Participants from 3 diverse care partner groups will be enrolled (care partners of persons with spinal cord injury, care partners of persons with Huntington disease, and care partners of persons with hematopoietic cell transplantation). Participants will be randomized to either a control group, where they will wear the Fitbit and provide daily reports of HRQOL over a 3-month (ie, 90 days) period (without personalized feedback), or the just-in-time adaptive intervention group, where they will wear the Fitbit, provide daily reports of HRQOL, and receive personalized push notifications for 3 months. At the end of the study, participants will complete a feasibility and acceptability questionnaire, and metrics regarding adherence and attrition will be calculated. RESULTS: This trial opened for recruitment in November 2020. Data collection was completed in June 2021, and the primary results are expected to be published in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will determine the feasibility and acceptability of an intensive app-based intervention in 3 distinct care partner groups: care partners for persons with a chronic condition that was caused by a traumatic event (ie, spinal cord injury); care partners for persons with a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease (ie, Huntington disease); and care partners for persons with episodic cancer conditions that require intense, prolonged inpatient and outpatient treatment (persons with hematopoietic cell transplantation).

Mobile Health for Pediatric Weight Management: Systematic Scoping Review,"Tully L, Burls A, Sorensen J, El-Moslemany R, O'Malley G.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Jun 3;8(6):e16214. doi: 10.2196/16214.,Tully L,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/06/04,PMC7301268,,10.2196/16214,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and consequences of obesity among children and adolescents remain a leading global public health concern, and evidence-based, multidisciplinary lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of treatment. Mobile electronic devices are widely used across socioeconomic categories and may provide a means of extending the reach and efficiency of health care interventions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding mobile health (mHealth) for the treatment of childhood overweight and obesity to map the breadth and nature of the literature in this field and describe the characteristics of published studies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic scoping review in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews, by searching nine academic databases in addition to gray literature for studies describing acceptability, usability, feasibility, effectiveness, adherence, or cost-effectiveness of interventions assessing mHealth for childhood obesity treatment. We also hand searched the reference lists of relevant articles. Studies aimed at the prevention of overweight or obesity were excluded, as were studies in which mHealth was not the primary mode of treatment delivery for at least one study arm or was not independently assessed. A random portion of all abstracts and full texts was double screened by a second reviewer to ensure consistency. Data were charted according to study characteristics, including design, participants, intervention content, behavior change theory (BCT) underpinning the study, mode of delivery, and outcomes measured. RESULTS: We identified 42 eligible studies assessing acceptability (n=7), usability (n=2), feasibility or pilot studies (n=15), treatment effect (n=17), and fidelity (n=1). Change in BMI z-scores or percentiles was most commonly measured, among a variety of dietary, physical activity, psychological, and usability or acceptability measures. SMS, mobile apps, and wearable devices made up the majority of mobile interventions, and 69% (29/42) of the studies specified a BCT used. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric weight management using mHealth is an emerging field, with most work to date aimed at developing and piloting such interventions. Few large trials are published, and these are heterogeneous in nature and rarely reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for eHealth guidelines. There is an evidence gap in the cost-effectiveness analyses of such studies."
Intervention and Evaluation of Mobile Health Technologies in Management of Patients Undergoing Chronic Dialysis: Scoping Review,"Yang Y, Chen H, Qazi H, Morita PP.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Apr 3;8(4):e15549. doi: 10.2196/15549.,Yang Y,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/04/04,PMC7165304,,10.2196/15549,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the effectiveness and user acceptance of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in managing patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, incorporating mHealth technology into the standard care of patients with CKD still faces many challenges. To our knowledge, there are no reviews on mHealth interventions and their assessments concerning the management of patients undergoing dialysis. OBJECTIVE: This study provided a scoping review on existing apps and interventions of mHealth technologies in adult patients undergoing chronic dialysis and identified the gaps in patient outcome assessment of mHealth technologies in the literature. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases, as well as gray literature sources. Two keywords, ""mHealth"" and ""dialysis,"" were combined to address the main concepts of the objectives. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) mHealth interventions, which are on a smartphone, tablet, or web-based portals that are accessible through mobile devices; and (2) adult patients (age >/=18 years) on chronic dialysis. Only English papers published from January 2008 to October 2018 were included. Studies with mHealth apps for other chronic conditions, based on e-consultation or videoconferencing, non-English publications, and review papers were excluded. RESULTS: Of the 1054 papers identified, 22 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies (n=20) were randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. These studies were carried out in 7 countries. The main purposes of these mHealth interventions were as follows: nutrition or dietary self-monitoring (n=7), remote biometric monitoring (n=7), web-based portal (n=4), self-monitoring of in-session dialysis-specific information (n=3), and self-monitoring of lifestyle or behavioral change (n=1). The outcomes of the 22 included studies were organized into five categories: (1) patient satisfaction and acceptance, (2) clinical effectiveness, (3) economic assessment, (4) health-related quality of life, and (5) impact on lifestyle or behavioral change. The mHealth interventions showed neutral to positive results in chronic dialysis patient management, reporting no to significant improvement of dialysis-specific measurements and some components of the overall quality of life assessment. Evaluation of these mHealth interventions consistently demonstrated evidence in patients' satisfaction, high level of user acceptance, and reduced use of health resources and cost savings to health care services. However, there is a lack of studies evaluating safety, organizational, sociocultural, ethical, and legal aspects of mHealth technologies. Furthermore, a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of adopting mHealth technologies was not found in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The gaps identified in this study will inform the creation of health policies and organizational support for mHealth implementation in patients undergoing dialysis. The findings of this review will inform the development of a comprehensive service model that utilizes mHealth technologies for home monitoring and self-management of patients undergoing chronic dialysis."
The efficacy of mobile health interventions used to manage acute or chronic pain: A systematic review,"Martin CL, Bakker CJ, Breth MS, Gao G, Lee K, Lee MA, Tiase VL, Tunby LJ, Wyatt TH, Janeway LM.",Res Nurs Health. 2021 Feb;44(1):111-128. doi: 10.1002/nur.22097. Epub 2020 Dec 20.,Martin CL,Res Nurs Health,2021,2020/12/20,,,10.1002/nur.22097,"Chronic pain is a significant health issue that affects approximately 50 million adults in the United States. Traditional interventions are not always an effective treatment strategy for pain control. However, the wide adoption of smartphones and the rapid growth of health information technologies over the past decade have created opportunities to use mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) for pain tracking and self-management. In this PRISMA-compliant systematic review, we assessed the current U.S.-based research on pain-related mHealth apps to describe the app components and determine the efficacy of these interventions for persons with acute or chronic pain. We conducted a comprehensive search of five databases based on methodological guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. We included articles reporting original data on mHealth interventions with pain intensity as a primary or secondary outcome and excluded articles that utilized multimodal interventions. Of the original 4959 articles, only five studies met the eligibility criteria. Most of the interventions included feasibility or pilot studies, and all studies were published between 2015 and 2018. Two of the five studies used visual analog scales. Only two of the studies reported statistically significant pain intensity outcomes, and considerable heterogeneity between the studies limited our ability to generalize findings or conduct a meta-analysis. Research investigating the components and efficacy of pain-related mHealth apps as interventions is an emerging field. To better understand the potential clinical benefits of mHealth apps designed to manage pain, further research is needed."
Increasing preparedness for caregiving and death in family caregivers of patients with severe illness who are cared for at home - study protocol for a web-based intervention,"Alvariza A, Häger-Tibell L, Holm M, Steineck G, Kreicbergs U.",BMC Palliat Care. 2020 Mar 17;19(1):33. doi: 10.1186/s12904-020-0530-6.,Alvariza A,BMC Palliat Care,2020,2020/03/19,PMC7079472,,10.1186/s12904-020-0530-6,"BACKGROUND: Family caregivers of patients with severe illness and in need for a palliative care approach, face numerous challenges and report having insufficient preparedness for the caregiver role as well as a need for information and psychosocial support. Preparing to care for a severely ill family members also means becoming aware of death. Feelings of being prepared are associated with positive aspects and regarded protective against negative health consequences. METHODS: The study adheres to the SPIRIT-guidelines (Supplementary 1), uses a pre-post design and include a web-based intervention. Inclusion criteria are; being a family caregiver of a patient with severe illness and in need of a palliative care approach. The intervention which aims to increase preparedness for caregiving and death is grounded in theory, research and clinical experience. The topics cover: medical issues, symptoms and symptom relief; communication within the couple, how to spend the time before death, being a caregiver, planning for the moment of death and; considerations of the future. The intervention is presented through videos and informative texts. The website also holds an online peer-support discussion forum. Study aims are to: evaluate feasibility in terms of framework, content, usage and partners' experiences; explore how the use of the website, influences family caregivers' preparedness for caregiving and death; explore how the use of the website influences family caregivers' knowledge about medical issues, their communication with the patient and their considerations of the future; and to investigate how the family caregivers' preparedness for caregiving and death influences their physical and psychological health and quality of life 1 year after the patient's death. Data will be collected through qualitative interviews and a study-specific questionnaire at four time-points. DISCUSSION: This project will provide information about whether support via a website has the potential to increase preparedness for caregiving and death and thereby decrease negative health consequences for family caregivers of patients affected by severe illness. It will provide new knowledge about intervention development, delivery, and evaluation in a palliative care context. Identification of factors before death and their association with family caregivers' preparedness and long-term health may change future clinical work. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03676283."

Given that an increasing proportion of Canadians have internet access and the increasing implementation of web-based interventions, online peer support interventions are a promising option to address the burden of chronic diseases. Thus, the specific research question of this scoping review is the following: What is known from the existing literature about the key characteristics of online peer support interventions for adults with chronic conditions? METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use the methodological frameworks used by Arksey and O'Malley as well as Levac and colleagues for the current scoping review. To be eligible for inclusion, studies must report on adults (>/=18 years of age) with one of the Public Health Agency of Canada chronic conditions or HIV/AIDS. We will limit our review to peer support interventions delivered through online formats. All study designs will be included. Only studies published from 2012 onwards will be included to ensure relevance to the current healthcare context and feasibility. Furthermore, only English language studies will be included. Studies will be identified by searching a variety of databases. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and abstracts identified by the literature search for inclusion (ie, level 1 screening), the full text articles (ie, level 2 screening) and then perform data abstraction. Abstracted data will include study characteristics, participant population, key characteristics of the intervention and outcomes collected. DISSEMINATION: This review will identify the key features of online peer support interventions and could assist in the future development of other online peer support programmes so that effective and sustainable programmes can be developed."
Effectiveness of Mobile Health Interventions on Diabetes and Obesity Treatment and Management: Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews,"Wang Y, Min J, Khuri J, Xue H, Xie B, A Kaminsky L, J Cheskin L.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Apr 28;8(4):e15400. doi: 10.2196/15400.,Wang Y,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/04/29,PMC7218595,,10.2196/15400,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes and obesity have become epidemics and costly chronic diseases. The impact of mobile health (mHealth) interventions on diabetes and obesity management is promising; however, studies showed varied results in the efficacy of mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for diabetes and obesity treatment and management on the basis of evidence reported in reviews and meta-analyses and to provide recommendations for future interventions and research. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and Cochrane databases for systematic reviews published between January 1, 2005, and October 1, 2019. We analyzed 17 reviews, which assessed 55,604 original intervention studies, that met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 6 reviews were included in our meta-analysis. RESULTS: The reviews primarily focused on the use of mobile apps and text messaging and the self-monitoring and management function of mHealth programs in patients with diabetes and obesity. All reviews examined changes in biomarkers, and some reviews assessed treatment adherence (n=7) and health behaviors (n=9). Although the effectiveness of mHealth interventions varied widely by study, all reviews concluded that mHealth was a feasible option and had the potential for improving patient health when compared with standard care, especially for glycemic control (-0.3% to -0.5% greater reduction in hemoglobin A(1c)) and weight reduction (-1.0 kg to -2.4 kg body weight). Overall, the existing 6 meta-analysis studies showed pooled favorable effects of these mHealth interventions (-0.79, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.42; I2=90.5). CONCLUSIONS: mHealth interventions are promising, but there is limited evidence about their effectiveness in glycemic control and weight reduction. Future research to develop evidence-based mHealth strategies should use valid measures and rigorous study designs. To enhance the effectiveness of mHealth interventions, future studies are warranted for the optimal formats and the frequency of contacting patients, better tailoring of messages, and enhancing usability, which places a greater emphasis on maintaining effectiveness over time."
Using digital interventions to improve the cardiometabolic health of populations: a meta-review of reporting quality,"O'Neil A, Cocker F, Rarau P, Baptista S, Cassimatis M, Barr Taylor C, Lau AYS, Kanuri N, Oldenburg B.",J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2017 Jul 1;24(4):867-879. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocw166.,O'Neil A,J Am Med Inform Assoc,2017,2017/03/25,PMC7651900,,10.1093/jamia/ocw166,"OBJECTIVES: We conducted a meta-review to determine the reporting quality of user-centered digital interventions for the prevention and management of cardiometabolic conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using predetermined inclusion criteria, systematic reviews published between 2010 and 2015 were identified from 3 databases. To assess whether current evidence is sufficient to inform wider uptake and implementation of digital health programs, we assessed the quality of reporting of research findings using (1) endorsement of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, (2) a quality assessment framework (eg, Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool), and (3) 8 parameters of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth Applications and onLine TeleHealth (CONSORT-eHEALTH) guidelines (developed in 2010). RESULTS: Of the 33 systematic reviews covering social media, Web-based programs, mobile health programs, and composite modalities, 6 reported using the recommended PRISMA guidelines. Seven did not report using a quality assessment framework. Applying the CONSORT-EHEALTH guidelines, reporting was of mild to moderate strength. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-review to provide a comprehensive analysis of the quality of reporting of research findings for a range of digital health interventions. Our findings suggest that the evidence base and quality of reporting in this rapidly developing field needs significant improvement in order to inform wider implementation and uptake. CONCLUSION: The inconsistent quality of reporting of digital health interventions for cardiometabolic outcomes may be a critical impediment to real-world implementation."
Study on self-management of real-time and individualized support in stroke patients based on resilience: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Jiang N, Xv Y, Sun X, Feng L, Wang YB, Jiang XL.",Trials. 2023 Aug 3;24(1):493. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07475-x.,Jiang N,Trials,2023,2023/08/03,PMC10401848,,10.1186/s13063-023-07475-x,"BACKGROUND: The transitional period from hospital to home is vital for stroke patients, but it poses serious challenges. Good self-management ability can optimize disease outcomes. However, stroke patients in China have a low level of self-management ability during the transitional period, and a lack of effective support may be the reason. With the rapid development of technology, using wearable monitors to achieve real-time and individualized support may be the key to solving this problem. This study uses a randomized controlled trial design to assess the efficacy of using wearable technology to realize real-time and individualized self-management support in stroke patients' self-management behavior during the transitional period following discharge from hospital. METHODS: This parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two hospitals and patients' homes. A total of 183 adult stroke patients will be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. The smartwatch intervention group (n = 61) will receive Real-time and Individualized Self-management Support (RISS) program + routine care, the wristband group (n = 61) will wear a fitness tracker (self-monitoring) + routine care, and the control group (n = 61) will receive routine stroke care. The intervention will last for 6 months. The primary outcomes are neurological function status, self-management behavior, quality of life, biochemical indicators, recurrence rate, and unplanned readmission rate. Secondary outcomes are resilience, patient activation, psychological status, and caregiver assessments. The analysis is intention-to-treat. The intervention effect will be evaluated at baseline (T0), 2 months after discharge (T1), 3 months after discharge (T2), and 6 months after discharge (T3). DISCUSSION: The cloud platform designed in this study not only has the function of real-time recording but also can push timely solutions when patients have abnormal conditions, as well as early warnings or alarms. This study could also potentially help patients develop good self-management habits through resilience theory, wearable devices, and individualized problem-solution library of self-management which can lay the foundation for long-term maintenance and continuous improvement of good self-management behavior in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The ethics approval has been granted by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University (2022-941). All patients will be informed of the study details and sign a written informed consent form before enrollment. The research results will be reported in conferences and peer-reviewed publications. The trial registration number is ChiCTR2300070384 . Registered on 11 April 2023."
Enhancing Behavioural Changes: A Narrative Review on the Effectiveness of a Multifactorial APP-Based Intervention Integrating Physical Activity,"Di Martino G, Della Valle C, Centorbi M, Buonsenso A, Fiorilli G, Calcagno G, Iuliano E, di Cagno A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2024 Feb 16;21(2):233. doi: 10.3390/ijerph21020233.,Di Martino G,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2024,2024/02/24,PMC10888703,,10.3390/ijerph21020233,"The rapid evolution of technologies is a key innovation in the organisation and management of physical activities (PA) and sports. The increase in benefits and opportunities related to the adoption of technologies for both the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and the management of chronic diseases is evident. In the field of telehealth, these devices provide personalised recommendations, workout monitoring and injury prevention. The study aimed to provide an overview of the landscape of technology application to PA organised to promote active lifestyles and improve chronic disease management. This review identified specific areas of focus for the selection of articles: the utilisation of mobile APPs and technological devices for enhancing weight loss, improving cardiovascular health, managing diabetes and cancer and preventing osteoporosis and cognitive decline. A multifactorial intervention delivered via mobile APPs, which integrates PA while managing diet or promoting social interaction, is unquestionably more effective than a singular intervention. The main finding related to promoting PA and a healthy lifestyle through app usage is associated with ""behaviour change techniques"". Even when individuals stop using the APP, they often maintain the structured or suggested lifestyle habits initially provided by the APP. Various concerns regarding the excessive use of APPs need to be addressed."
Impact of Smartphone App-Based Psychological Interventions for Reducing Depressive Symptoms in People With Depression: Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Serrano-Ripoll MJ, Zamanillo-Campos R, Fiol-DeRoque MA, Castro A, Ricci-Cabello I.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 Jan 27;10(1):e29621. doi: 10.2196/29621.,Serrano-Ripoll MJ,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/01/27,PMC8832272,,10.2196/29621,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a serious, disabling mental disorder that severely affects quality of life. Patients with depression often do not receive adequate treatment. App-based psychotherapy is considered to have great potential to treat depression owing to its reach and easy accessibility. OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze the impact of app-based psychological interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 23, 2020. We selected randomized controlled trials to examine the impact of app-based psychological interventions for reducing depressive symptoms in people with depression. Study selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal (using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized studies and the ROBINS-I tool for nonrandomized studies) were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Where possible, we pooled data using random effects meta-analyses to obtain estimates of the effect size of the intervention. We conducted post hoc meta-regression analyses to explore the factors associated with intervention success. RESULTS: After screening 3468 unique references retrieved from bibliographic searches and assessing the eligibility of 79 full texts, we identified 12 trials (2859 participants) evaluating 14 different interventions. Of 14 trials, 7 (58%) were conducted in the United States; 3 (25%) trials, in Asia (Japan, South Korea, and China); 1 (8%) trial, in Australia; and 1 (8%) trial, in Germany. Of the 12 trials, 5 (42%) trials presented a low risk of bias. The mean duration of the interventions was 6.6 (SD 2.8) weeks. Two-thirds of the interventions were based on cognitive behavioral therapy alone or included it in combination with cognitive control therapy, positive psychology, brief behavioral activation, or mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapy. With no evidence of publication bias, a pooled analysis of 83% (10/12) of the trials and 86% (12/14) of the interventions showed that app-based interventions, compared with a control group receiving usual care or minimal intervention, produced a moderate reduction in depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.51, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.33; 2018/2859, 70.58% of the participants; I(2)=70%). Our meta-regression analyses indicated that there was a greater reduction in symptoms of depression (P=.04) in trials that included participants with moderate to severe depression (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.55), compared with trials with participants exhibiting mild to moderate depression (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.12). CONCLUSIONS: App-based interventions targeted at people with depression produce moderate reductions in the symptoms of depression. More methodologically robust trials are needed to confirm our findings, determine which intervention features are associated with greater improvements, and identify those populations most likely to benefit from this type of intervention.

In the face of an aging population, it is important for health care sectors to find solutions in delivering health services efficiently and effectively to middle-aged and older adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to consolidate the literature that reported the effectiveness of eHealth apps in delivering nutritional interventions for middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: A literature search from five databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Global Health) from the past 5 years was performed. Studies were selected for inclusion that used eHealth to deliver nutritional interventions to adults aged 40 years and above, and reported health and behavioral outcomes. Two independent reviewers searched for research articles and assessed the eligibility of studies to be included in the review. A third reviewer resolved disagreements on study inclusion. We also assessed the quality of the included studies using the CONSORT 2010 checklist. RESULTS: A total of 70 studies were included for analysis. The study quality ranged from 44% to 85%. The most commonly used eHealth intervention type was mobile apps (22/70, 31%). The majority of studies (62/70, 89%) provided multicomponent health interventions, which aimed to improve nutrition and other health behaviors (eg, exercise, smoking cessation, medication adherence). Meta-analysis results indicated high and significant heterogeneity; hence, conclusions based on these results should be considered with caution. Nonetheless, the results generally showed that eHealth interventions improved anthropometric and clinical outcomes, but not behavioral outcomes such as fruit and vegetable consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The use of eHealth apps to deliver health interventions has been increasing in recent years, and these apps have the potential to deliver health services to a larger group of people. Our findings showed that the effectiveness of eHealth apps to deliver health interventions for middle-aged to older adults was supported by the improvement of anthropometric and clinical outcomes. Future work could aim to develop research frameworks in administering eHealth interventions to address heterogeneity in this field of research."
Mobile Health Technology Interventions for Suicide Prevention: Systematic Review,"Melia R, Francis K, Hickey E, Bogue J, Duggan J, O'Sullivan M, Young K.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Jan 15;8(1):e12516. doi: 10.2196/12516.,Melia R,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/01/16,PMC6996750,,10.2196/12516,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions are proposed as one way by which effective treatments for self-harm and suicidal ideation may be improved and their scalability enhanced. Mobile devices offer a potentially powerful medium to deliver evidence-based interventions with greater specificity to the individual when the intervention is needed. The recent proliferation of publicly available mobile apps designed for suicide prevention underlines the need for robust evidence to promote safe practice. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to examine the effectiveness of currently available mobile health (mHealth) technology tools in reducing suicide-specific outcomes. METHODS: The following databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and relevant sources of gray literature. All published and unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pseudo-RCTs, and pre-post observational studies that evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth technology in suicide prevention delivered via mobile computing and communication technology were included. Studies were included if they measured at least one suicide outcome variable (ie, suicidal ideation, suicidal intent, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, and suicidal behavior). A total of 2 review authors independently extracted data and assessed study suitability, in accordance with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool, on July 31, 2018. Owing to the heterogeneity of outcomes found across studies, results were not amenable for pooled synthesis, and a meta-analysis was not performed. A narrative synthesis of the available research is presented here. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies met criteria for inclusion . Four published articles that reported on the effectiveness of the following mobile phone apps were included: iBobbly, Virtual Hope Box, BlueIce, and Therapeutic Evaluative Conditioning. Results demonstrated some positive impacts for individuals at elevated risk of suicide or self-harm, including reductions in depression, psychological distress, and self-harm and increases in coping self-efficacy. None of the apps evaluated demonstrated the ability to significantly decrease suicidal ideation compared with a control condition. In addition, 3 unpublished and recently completed trials also met criteria for inclusion in the review. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of stand-alone mHealth technology-based interventions in suicide prevention. The small number of studies reported in this review tentatively indicate that such tools may have a positive impact on suicide-specific outcomes. Future mHealth intervention evaluations would benefit from addressing the following 3 main methodological limitations : (1) heterogeneity of outcomes: a lack of standardized measurement of suicide outcomes across studies; (2) ecological validity: the tendency to exclude potential participants because of the elevated suicide risk may reduce generalizability within clinical settings; and (3) app regulation and definition: the lack of a standardized classification system for mHealth intervention type points to the need for better definition of the scope of such technologies to promote safe practice.

Smokers' user experience of smoking cessation apps: A systematic review,"Zhang M, Wolters M, O'Connor S, Wang Y, Doi L.",Int J Med Inform. 2023 Jul;175:105069. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2023.105069. Epub 2023 Apr 15.,Zhang M,Int J Med Inform,2023,2023/04/21,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2023.105069,"OBJECTIVES: To explore how smokers view common functions and characteristics of smoking cessation apps. DESIGN: Systematic review. SEARCH SOURCES: CINAHL PLUS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar. REVIEW METHODS: Seven digital databases were searched separately using relevant search terms. Search results were uploaded to Covidence. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified with the expert team in advance. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened by two reviewers independently. Any disagreements were discussed in research meetings. Pertinent data were extracted and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Findings were presented in a narrative approach. RESULTS: 28 studies were included in this review. The overarching themes were app functionality and app characteristics. Under app ""functionality"", six subthemes emerged: 1) education; 2) tracking; 3) social support; 4) compensation; 5) distraction, and 6) reminding. Under ""app characteristics"", five subthemes emerged: 1) simplification, 2) personalisation, 3) diverse content forms, 4) interactivity, and 5) privacy and security. CONCLUSION: Understanding user needs and expectations is crucial for developing a programme theory for smoking cessation app interventions. Relevant needs identified in this review should be linked to broader theories of smoking cessation and app-based intervention."
mHealth Interventions to Reduce Physical Inactivity and Sedentary Behavior in Children and Adolescents: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Baumann H, Fiedler J, Wunsch K, Woll A, Wollesen B.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 May 11;10(5):e35920. doi: 10.2196/35920.,Baumann H,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/05/11,PMC9133983,,10.2196/35920,"BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents increasingly do not meet physical activity (PA) recommendations. Hence, insufficient PA (IPA) and sedentary behavior (SB) among children and adolescents are relevant behavior change domains for using individualized mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on IPA and SB, with a special focus on the age and level of individualization. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published between January 2000 and March 2021. mHealth interventions for primary prevention in children and adolescents addressing behavior change related to IPA and SB were included. Included studies were compared for content characteristics and methodological quality and summarized narratively. In addition, a meta-analysis with a subsequent exploratory meta-regression examining the moderating effects of age and individualization on overall effectiveness was performed. RESULTS: On the basis of the inclusion criteria, 1.3% (11/828) of the preliminary identified studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 1.2% (10/828) were included in the meta-analysis. Trials included a total of 1515 participants (mean age (11.69, SD 0.788 years; 65% male and 35% female) self-reported (3/11, 27%) or device-measured (8/11, 73%) health data on the duration of SB and IPA for an average of 9.3 (SD 5.6) weeks. Studies with high levels of individualization significantly decreased insufficient PA levels (Cohen d=0.33; 95% CI 0.08-0.58; Z=2.55; P=.01), whereas those with low levels of individualization (Cohen d=-0.06; 95% CI -0.32 to 0.20; Z=0.48; P=.63) or targeting SB (Cohen d=-0.11; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.23; Z=1.73; P=.08) indicated no overall significant effect. The heterogeneity of the studies was moderate to low, and significant subgroup differences were found between trials with high and low levels of individualization (chi(2)(1)=4.0; P=.04; I(2)=75.2%). Age as a moderator variable showed a small effect; however, the results were not significant, which might have been because of being underpowered. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that mHealth interventions for children and adolescents can foster moderate reductions in IPA but not SB. Moreover, individualized mHealth interventions to reduce IPA seem to be more effective for adolescents than for children. Although, to date, only a few mHealth studies have addressed inactive and sedentary young people, and their quality of evidence is moderate, these findings indicate the relevance of individualization on the one hand and the difficulties in reducing SB using mHealth interventions on the other.

A Systematic Review of mHealth-Based Heart Failure Interventions,"Cajita MI, Gleason KT, Han HR.",J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2016 May-Jun;31(3):E10-22. doi: 10.1097/JCN.0000000000000305.,Cajita MI,J Cardiovasc Nurs,2016,2015/11/07,PMC4828274,NIHMS718748,10.1097/JCN.0000000000000305,"BACKGROUND: The popularity of mobile phones and similar mobile devices makes it an ideal medium for delivering interventions. This is especially true with heart failure (HF) interventions, in which mHealth-based HF interventions are rapidly replacing their telephone-based predecessors. PURPOSE: This systematic review examined the impact of mHealth-based HF management interventions on HF outcomes. The specific aims of the systematic review are to (1) describe current mHealth-based HF interventions and (2) discuss the impact of these interventions on HF outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL Plus, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Scopus were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies that tested mHealth interventions in people with HF using the terms Heart Failure, Mobile Health, mHealth, Telemedicine, Text Messaging, Texting, Short Message Service, Mobile Applications, and Mobile Apps. CONCLUSIONS: Ten articles, representing 9 studies, were included in this review. The majority of the studies utilized mobile health technology as part of an HF monitoring system, which typically included a blood pressure-measuring device, weighing scale, and an electrocardiogram recorder. The impact of the mHealth interventions on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, HF-related hospitalizations, length of stay, New York Heart Association functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction, quality of life, and self-care were inconsistent at best. IMPLICATIONS: Further research is needed to conclusively determine the impact of mHealth interventions on HF outcomes. The limitations of the current studies (eg, inadequate sample size, quasi-experimental design, use of older mobile phone models, etc) should be taken into account when designing future studies."
Finding My Way-Advanced: can a web-based psychosocial intervention improve the mental quality of life for women with metastatic breast cancer vs attention-control? Study protocol of a randomised controlled trial,"Beatty L, Kemp E, Butow P, Girgis A, Hulbert-Williams N, Kaambwa B, Schofield P, Turner J, Woodman R, Boyle F, Daly A, Jones A, Kiely B, Zdenkowski N; FMW-A Authorship Group; Koczwara B.",BMC Cancer. 2022 Dec 24;22(1):1353. doi: 10.1186/s12885-022-10410-z.,Beatty L,BMC Cancer,2022,2022/12/24,PMC9789659,,10.1186/s12885-022-10410-z,"BACKGROUND: Women living with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are at risk of significantly impaired quality of life (QOL), symptom burden, distress and fear of progression, and unmet needs, yet they face barriers to accessing evidence-based psychosocial treatments. Our group therefore developed Finding My Way-Advanced (FMW-A), a web-based self-guided psychosocial program for women with MBC. This study aims to assess its efficacy in improving mental and other QOL domains, distress, fear of progression, unmet needs, and health service utilisation. METHODS: The multi-site randomised controlled trial (RCT) will enrol 370 Australian participants. Eligible participants are adult (18 years +) women diagnosed with MBC, with a life expectancy of 6 months or more, with sufficient English-language literacy to provide informed consent. Participants will be identified, screened and referred from one of 10 Australian sites, or via self-referral in response to advertisements. Participants complete four online questionnaires: prior to accessing their program ('baseline'), 6 weeks later ('post-intervention'), then 3 months and 6 months post-intervention. Consenting participants will be randomised to either FMW-A (intervention), or Breast Cancer Network Australia's (BCNA) online/app resource My Journey (minimal intervention attention-control). This is a single-blind study, with randomisation computer-generated and stratified by site. FMW-A is a 6-module program addressing some of the most common issues experienced by women with MBC, with BCNA control resources integrated within the 'resources' section. All modules are immediately accessible, with an additional booster module released 10 weeks later. The primary outcome is mental QOL; statistical criteria for superiority is defined as a 4-point difference between groups at post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include other QOL domains, distress, fear of progression, health service use, intervention adherence, and user satisfaction. DISCUSSION: This will be the first adequately powered RCT of a self-directed online intervention for women with MBC. If efficacious, FMW-A will help address two national key priorities for management of MBC - enhancing QOL and reducing symptom burden. FMW-A has the potential to address unmet needs and overcome access barriers for this overlooked population, while reducing health system burden.

A Gambling Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (GamblingLess: In-The-Moment): Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial,"Dowling NA, Merkouris SS, Youssef GJ, Lubman DI, Bagot KL, Hawker CO, Portogallo HJ, Thomas AC, Rodda SN.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Aug 23;11(8):e38958. doi: 10.2196/38958.,Dowling NA,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/08/23,PMC9449828,,10.2196/38958,"BACKGROUND: The presence of discrete but fluctuating precipitants, in combination with the dynamic nature of gambling episodes, calls for the development of tailored interventions delivered in real time, such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). JITAIs leverage mobile and wireless technologies to address dynamically changing individual needs by providing the type and amount of support required at the right time and only when needed. They have the added benefit of reaching underserved populations by providing accessible, convenient, and low-burden support. Despite these benefits, few JITAIs targeting gambling behavior are available. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to redress this gap in service provision by developing and evaluating a theoretically informed and evidence-based JITAI for people who want to reduce their gambling. Delivered via a smartphone app, GamblingLess: In-The-Moment provides tailored cognitive-behavioral and third-wave interventions targeting cognitive processes explicated by the relapse prevention model (cravings, self-efficacy, and positive outcome expectancies). It aims to reduce gambling symptom severity (distal outcome) through short-term reductions in the likelihood of gambling episodes (primary proximal outcome) by improving craving intensity, self-efficacy, or expectancies (secondary proximal outcomes). The primary aim is to explore the degree to which the delivery of a tailored intervention at a time of cognitive vulnerability reduces the probability of a subsequent gambling episode. METHODS: GamblingLess: In-The-Moment interventions are delivered to gamblers who are in a state of receptivity (available for treatment) and report a state of cognitive vulnerability via ecological momentary assessments 3 times a day. The JITAI will tailor the type, timing, and amount of support for individual needs. Using a microrandomized trial, a form of sequential factorial design, each eligible participant will be randomized to a tailored intervention condition or no intervention control condition at each ecological momentary assessment across a 28-day period. The microrandomized trial will be supplemented by a 6-month within-group follow-up evaluation to explore long-term effects on primary (gambling symptom severity) and secondary (gambling behavior, craving severity, self-efficacy, and expectancies) outcomes and an acceptability evaluation via postintervention surveys, app use and engagement indices, and semistructured interviews. In all, 200 participants will be recruited from Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: The project was funded in June 2019, with approval from the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2020-304). Stakeholder user testing revealed high acceptability scores. The trial began on March 29, 2022, and 84 participants have been recruited (as of June 24, 2022). Results are expected to be published mid-2024. CONCLUSIONS: GamblingLess: In-The-Moment forms part of a suite of theoretically informed and evidence-based web-based and mobile gambling interventions. This trial will provide important empirical data that can be used to facilitate the JITAI's optimization to make it a more effective, efficient, and scalable tailored intervention.

Three-arm randomised controlled trial of an m-health app and digital engagement strategy for improving treatment adherence and reducing suicidal ideation in young people: study protocol,"McGillivray L, Gan DZQ, Wong Q, Han J, Hetrick S, Christensen H, Torok M.",BMJ Open. 2022 May 30;12(5):e058584. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058584.,McGillivray L,BMJ Open,2022,2022/05/31,PMC9152944,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058584,"INTRODUCTION: Youth suicidal ideation and behaviour is concerning due to its widespread prevalence, morbidity and potentially fatal consequences. Digital mental health interventions have been found to improve access to low-cost and high-quality support for a range of mental health issues, yet there are few digital interventions available for suicide prevention in young people. In addition, no studies have examined how digital engagement strategies may impact the engagement and efficacy of digital interventions in suicide prevention. The current protocol describes a three-arm parallel randomised controlled trial. A therapeutic smartphone application ('LifeBuoy'; intervention condition) will be tested against a condition that consists of the LifeBuoy application plus access to a digital engagement strategy ('LifeBuoy+engagement'; intervention condition) to determine whether the addition of the digital strategy improves app engagement metrics. To establish the efficacy of the LifeBuoy application, both of these intervention conditions will be tested against an attention-matched control condition (a placebo app). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 669 young Australians aged 17-24 years who have experienced suicidal ideation in the past 30 days will be recruited by Facebook advertisement. The primary outcomes will be suicidal ideation severity and level of app engagement. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes from baseline to 30-day, 60-day and 120-day follow-up time points relative to the control group using mixed-effect modelling. A subset of participants in the intervention groups will be interviewed on their experience with the app and engagement strategy. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive approach, independent of a theoretical confirmative method to identify the group themes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the University of New South Wales Human Research Ethics Committee (HC210400). The results of the trial will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals and conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12621001247864."
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Mobile Health in Breast Cancer Care: A Systematic Review,"Flaucher M, Zakreuskaya A, Nissen M, Mocker A, Fasching PA, Beckmann MW, Eskofier BM, Leutheuser H.",Oncologist. 2023 Oct 3;28(10):e847-e858. doi: 10.1093/oncolo/oyad217.,Flaucher M,Oncologist,2023,2023/08/03,PMC10546835,,10.1093/oncolo/oyad217,"Breast cancer is affecting millions of people worldwide. If not appropriately handled, the side effects of different modalities of cancer treatment can negatively impact patients' quality of life and cause treatment interruptions. In recent years, mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown promising opportunities to support breast cancer care. Numerous studies implemented mobile health interventions aiming to support patients with breast cancer, for example, through physical activity promotion or educational content. Nonetheless, current literature reveals that real-world evidence for the actual benefits remains unclear. In this systematic review, we focus on analyzing the methodology used in recent studies to determine the effects of mHealth applications and wearable devices on the outcome of patients with breast cancer. We followed the PRISMA guideline for the selection, analysis, and reporting of relevant studies found in the databases of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. A total of 276 unique records were identified, and 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. While many of the studies used standardized questionnaires as patient-reported outcome measures, there was minimal use of objective measurements, such as activity sensors. Adoption, drop-out rates, and usage behavior of users of the mobile health intervention were often not reported. Future work should clearly define the focus and desired outcome of mHealth interventions and select outcome measures accordingly. Greater transparency facilitates the interpretation of results and conclusions about the real-world evidence of mobile health in breast cancer care."

METHODS: The databases searched were MedLine/PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, Science Direct, Lilacs, and SciELO. After removing duplicates, applying exclusion criteria, and checking the reference lists, 45 studies were reviewed. The Downs and Black (D&B) scale measured methodological quality, and a random effect model was used to compute the meta-analysis of PA by the reported unit (minutes per day or steps per day), delivery agent (application (APP), SMS, or other), and PA measurement (questionnaire, accelerometer, pedometer). RESULTS: Mobile phone-based PA interventions were efficient in increasing both minutes [10.49; CI (3.37-17.60); p = 0.004] and steps per day [735.17; CI (227.72-1242.61); p = 0.005] in adults when compared to baseline. Furthermore, APP-based interventions were able to increase the number of steps (p = 0.04) and minutes per day of PA (p = 0.04) in adults. Also, 85% of included manuscripts were classified as moderate- to high-quality articles. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phone-based PA interventions, inclusive those delivery by APP, were effective to increase minutes and steps per day in adults."
"The effectiveness of using a WeChat account to improve exclusive breastfeeding in Huzhu County Qinghai Province, China: protocol for a randomized control trial","Wu Q, Huang Y, van Velthoven MH, Wang W, Chang S, Zhang Y.",BMC Public Health. 2019 Dec 2;19(1):1603. doi: 10.1186/s12889-019-7676-2.,Wu Q,BMC Public Health,2019,2019/12/04,PMC6889429,,10.1186/s12889-019-7676-2,"BACKGROUND: An exclusive breastfeeding rate in the first 6 months of life of at least 50% is one of the six World Health Organization global nutrition targets for 2025. However, the exclusive breastfeeding rate in China is quite low and decreasing which makes it urgent to explore effective ways to reverse the current downward trend. As mobile technologies have rapidly developed, mobile communication apps such as WeChat (one of the largest social networking platforms in China) are well accepted and have the potential to improve health behaviors in a convenient way. The current paper describes the study protocol of a WeChat intervention that aims to promote breastfeeding in rural areas in China. METHODS: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial in rural Qinghai Province, China. Women who are 14-36 weeks pregnant will be randomized to routine antenatal and postnatal care, or routine care plus the WeChat breastfeeding education. pregnant women with a severe disease and complications of pregnancy or HIV-1 will be excluded. Breastfeeding knowledge and promotion information will be delivered to the intervention group through a WeChat official account from 3 months pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The outcome assessments are conducted at baseline through face-to-face interviews, and at one week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postpartum by telephone interviews. The primary outcome is difference in the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postpartum between the intervention group and the control group. Secondary outcomes include the overall duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding across the first 6 months postpartum; mothers' knowledge of breastfeeding; the proportion of early initiation of breastfeeding; and the timing of the introduction of solid food to infants. Intention-to-treat-analysis will be used. Survival analysis will be used to compare the overall duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding between groups. DISCUSSION: This study is the first effort to promote exclusive breastfeeding through WeChat in China. Our results will provide scientific evidence for the effect of health education through WeChat on breastfeeding. Thereby this may offer a comprehensive intervention to promote exclusive breastfeeding in China and other settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry -ChiCTR1800017364.

The possible mediating effects of depression are also discussed.Methods: The databases Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, IEEEXplore, ACM and CRESP were searched. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and risk of bias using standard assessment criteria.Results: Fourteen RCTs were reviewed, reporting data on 3455 participants. Although findings were more consistent for the effectiveness of online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Mindfulness-Based CBT and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there was insufficient research to consider any as evidence-based treatments for suicidal ideation and self-harm.Conclusions: Digital interventions for suicidal ideation and self-harm can be a safe and acceptable option for individuals unwilling or unable to access face-to-face interventions. However, further research is needed to understand the types of interventions that could support people and the risk-benefit ratio of digital interventions for these individuals."
Peers plus mobile app for treatment in HIV (PATH): protocol for a randomized controlled trial to test a community-based integrated peer support and mHealth intervention to improve viral suppression among Hispanic and Black people living with HIV,"Pitpitan EV, Horvath KJ, Aldous J, Stockman JK, Patterson TL, Liang M, Barrozo C, Moore V, Penninga K, Smith LR.",Trials. 2024 Mar 22;25(1):212. doi: 10.1186/s13063-024-08042-8.,Pitpitan EV,Trials,2024,2024/03/23,PMC10958824,,10.1186/s13063-024-08042-8,"BACKGROUND: Significant disparities continue to exist in the HIV care continuum, whereby Hispanic and Black people living with HIV (PLWH) are less likely to achieve viral suppression compared to their White counterparts. Studies have shown that intervention approaches that involve peer navigation may play an important role in supporting patients to stay engaged in HIV care. However, implementation may be challenging in real-world settings where there are limited resources to support peer navigators. Combining a peer navigation approach with scalable mobile health (mHealth) technology may improve impact and implementation outcomes. METHODS: We combined a peer navigation intervention with a mHealth application and are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of this integrated ""Peers plus mobile App for Treatment in HIV"" (PATH) intervention to improve HIV care engagement, and ultimately sustained viral suppression, among Hispanic and Black PLWH. We will enroll up to 375 PLWH into a two-arm prospective RCT, conducting follow-up assessments every 3 months up to 12 months post-baseline. Participants randomized to the control arm will continue to receive usual care Ryan White Program case management services. Individuals randomized to receive the PATH intervention will receive usual care plus access to two main intervention components: (1) a peer navigation program and (2) a mHealth web application. The primary outcome is sustained HIV viral suppression (undetectable viral load observed at 6- and 12-month follow-up). Secondary outcomes are retention in HIV care, gaps in HIV medical visits, and self-reported ART adherence. Recruitment for the RCT began in November 2021 and will continue until June 2024. Follow-up assessments and medical chart abstractions will be conducted to collect measurements of outcome variables. DISCUSSION: The efficacy trial of PATH will help to fill gaps in our scientific understanding of how a combined peer navigation and mHealth approach may produce effects on HIV care outcomes while addressing potential implementation challenges of peer navigation in Ryan White-funded clinics.

Mobile applications in adolescent psychotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review,"Wüllner S, Hermenau K, Krutkova M, Petras IK, Hecker T, Siniatchkin M.",Front Public Health. 2024 Feb 14;12:1345808. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2024.1345808. eCollection 2024.,Wüllner S,Front Public Health,2024,2024/02/29,PMC10899334,,10.3389/fpubh.2024.1345808,"BACKGROUND: To bridge the gap in adolescent psychotherapy created by the increasing need for mental health interventions and the limited possibilities of in-person treatment during the pandemic, many health care providers opted to offer online mental health care programs. As a result, the number of mental health apps available in app stores experienced a sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current review is to provide an overview of feasibility and effectiveness studies testing mobile applications in adolescent psychotherapy during the peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a literature search in Pubmed, PsychInfo, Google Scholar, OpenSIGLE and OpenGREY for papers published from June 2020 to June 2023. Studies were included if they evaluated app-based interventions intended for psychotherapeutic treatment and targeted adolescents between 12 and 27 years of age with symptoms of psychological disorders. The quality of each study was assessed using the Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observational Research (SAQOR). Effectiveness outcomes were analyzed by vote counting and calculating a binomial probability test. RESULTS: The search yielded 31 relevant studies that examined 27 different apps with a total of 1,578 adolescent participants. Nine articles were primary effectiveness studies and 22 focused on feasibility measures as primary outcome. There was evidence that mental health apps influenced adolescents' psychotherapy, with 83% of the studies with effectiveness outcomes favoring the intervention (p = 0.002). Sixty-one percent of the included studies were rated at low or very low quality. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has given apps a firm and important role in healthcare that will probably continue to expand in the future. To ensure that mental health apps are truly effective and beneficial for adolescents' psychotherapy, we need a standardized measurement of quality features of mental health apps and higher quality app evaluation studies.

Ecological Momentary Assessment and Smartphone Application Intervention in Adolescents with Substance Use and Comorbid Severe Psychiatric Disorders: Study Protocol,"Benarous X, Edel Y, Consoli A, Brunelle J, Etter JF, Cohen D, Khazaal Y.",Front Psychiatry. 2016 Sep 20;7:157. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00157. eCollection 2016.,Benarous X,Front Psychiatry,2016,2016/10/06,PMC5028912,,10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00157,"CONTEXT: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent among inpatient adolescents with psychiatric disorders. In this population, substance use and other psychiatric outcomes can reinforce one another. Despite the need for integrated interventions in youths with dual diagnoses, few specific instruments are available. App-based technologies have shown promising results to help reduce substance use in adolescents, but their applicability in youths with associated severe psychiatric disorders is poorly documented. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) intervention for all substance users, and of a smartphone application for cannabis users (Stop-Cannabis), for outpatient treatment after hospital discharge. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All inpatient adolescents with psychiatric disorders hospitalized between 2016 and 2018 in a university hospital will be systematically screened for SUD and, if positive, will be assessed by an independent specialist addiction team. Participants with confirmed SUDs will be invited and helped to download an EMA app and, if required, the Stop-Cannabis app, the week preceding hospital discharge. Information about the acceptability and use of both apps and the validity of EMA data in comparison to clinical assessments will be assessed after 6 months and 1 year. DISCUSSION: This research has been designed to raise specific issues for consideration regarding the sequence between substance use, contextual factors, and other psychiatric symptoms among adolescents with comorbid severe psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved will inform the development of integrated treatment for dual disorders at that age. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has already been approved and granted. Dissemination will include presentations at international congresses as well as publications in peer-reviewed journals.

Internet interventions to support lifestyle modification for diabetes management: a systematic review of the evidence,"Cotter AP, Durant N, Agne AA, Cherrington AL.",J Diabetes Complications. 2014 Mar-Apr;28(2):243-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2013.07.003. Epub 2013 Dec 12.,Cotter AP,J Diabetes Complications,2014,2013/12/17,PMC3943472,NIHMS511726,10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2013.07.003,"BACKGROUND: The Internet presents a widely accessible, 24-h means to promote chronic disease management. The objective of this review is to identify studies that used Internet based interventions to promote lifestyle modification among adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We searched PubMed using the terms: [internet, computer, phone, smartphone, mhealth, mobile health, web based, telehealth, social media, text messages] combined with [diabetes management and diabetes control] through January 2013. Studies were included if they described an Internet intervention, targeted adults with type 2 diabetes, focused on lifestyle modification, and included an evaluation component with behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 2803 papers identified, nine met inclusion criteria. Two studies demonstrated improvements in diet and/or physical activity and two studies demonstrated improvements in glycemic control comparing web-based intervention with control. Successful studies were theory-based, included interactive components with tracking and personalized feedback, and provided opportunities for peer support. Website utilization declined over time in all studies that reported on it. Few studies focused on high risk, underserved populations. CONCLUSION: Web-based strategies provide a viable option for facilitating diabetes self-management. Future research is needed on the use of web-based interventions in underserved communities and studies examining website utilization patterns and engagement over time."
The mobile assistance for regulating smoking (MARS) micro-randomized trial design protocol,"Nahum-Shani I, Potter LN, Lam CY, Yap J, Moreno A, Stoffel R, Wu Z, Wan N, Dempsey W, Kumar S, Ertin E, Murphy SA, Rehg JM, Wetter DW.",Contemp Clin Trials. 2021 Nov;110:106513. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2021.106513. Epub 2021 Jul 24.,Nahum-Shani I,Contemp Clin Trials,2021,2021/07/27,PMC8824313,NIHMS1737350,10.1016/j.cct.2021.106513,"Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. Empirical evidence suggests that engaging in evidence-based self-regulatory strategies (e.g., behavioral substitution, mindful attention) can improve smokers' ability to resist craving and build self-regulatory skills. However, poor engagement represents a major barrier to maximizing the impact of self-regulatory strategies. This paper describes the protocol for Mobile Assistance for Regulating Smoking (MARS) - a research study designed to inform the development of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention for promoting real-time, real-world engagement in evidence-based self-regulatory strategies. The study will employ a 10-day Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) enrolling 112 smokers attempting to quit. Utilizing a mobile smoking cessation app, the MRT will randomize each individual multiple times per day to either: (a) no intervention prompt; (b) a prompt recommending brief (low effort) cognitive and/or behavioral self-regulatory strategies; or (c) a prompt recommending more effortful cognitive or mindfulness-based strategies. Prompts will be delivered via push notifications from the MARS mobile app. The goal is to investigate whether, what type of, and under what conditions prompting the individual to engage in self-regulatory strategies increases engagement. The results will build the empirical foundation necessary to develop a mHealth intervention that effectively utilizes intensive longitudinal self-report and sensor-based assessments of emotions, context and other factors to engage an individual in the type of self-regulatory activity that would be most beneficial given their real-time, real-world circumstances. This type of mHealth intervention holds enormous potential to expand the reach and impact of smoking cessation treatments."
Web-based and mHealth interventions for intimate partner violence prevention: a systematic review protocol,"Anderson EJ, McClelland J, Meyer Krause C, Krause KC, Garcia DO, Koss MP.",BMJ Open. 2019 Aug 10;9(8):e029880. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029880.,Anderson EJ,BMJ Open,2019,2019/08/12,PMC6701589,,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029880,"INTRODUCTION: Victims of intimate partner violence (IPV), or those individuals susceptible to IPV victimisation or perpetration, may benefit from participation in primary, secondary or tertiary interventions to address or mitigate exposure to violence despite mixed evidence of IPV intervention effectiveness. However, participation in such programmes is limited by poor access, sociocultural barriers and programme cost. As the world fast approaches universal access to the internet, web-based technologies and low-cost smartphones, new avenues to provide preventive health services including mobile health (mHealth) tools, platforms and services have emerged. The objective of this systematic review is to assess current web-based and mHealth interventions, which include web-based or mobile-based delivery methods for IPV prevention. Interpersonal violence is defined as perpetration or victimisation of a physical, psychological or sexual nature among adults. Interventions may be at the primary, secondary or tertiary level of the public health model. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This systematic review will incorporate studies focused on any empirical prevention intervention intended for IPV victims or perpetrators of any gender where one or more components is web based or mobile based. Articles will be retrieved from the following academic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Open Grey, as well Google Scholar. Results will be limited to articles reporting primary data, published since 1998, and in English, Spanish, Portuguese or French. Data extraction procedures will follow Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool, a critical appraisal tool, will be used to record ratings of quality and risk of bias among studies selected for inclusion. Content analysis and between-study comparisons will be used to answer the objectives of this review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results from this review will be published in an open access format for the benefit of both academic and non-academic audiences, including community organisations and individuals seeking mHealth strategies to reduce and prevent IPV.

Cocreating an Automated mHealth Apps Systematic Review Process With Generative AI: Design Science Research Approach,"Giunti G, Doherty CP.",JMIR Med Educ. 2024 Feb 12;10:e48949. doi: 10.2196/48949.,Giunti G,JMIR Med Educ,2024,2024/02/12,PMC10897815,,10.2196/48949,"BACKGROUND: The use of mobile devices for delivering health-related services (mobile health [mHealth]) has rapidly increased, leading to a demand for summarizing the state of the art and practice through systematic reviews. However, the systematic review process is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to automate tedious tasks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools. METHODS: We used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews. RESULTS: A triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps. This approach could be particularly useful for researchers with limited coding skills. However, the study has limitations related to the design science research methodology, subjectivity bias, and the quality of the search results used to train the language model."
Assessing the Pragmatic Nature of Mobile Health Interventions Promoting Physical Activity: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Stecher C, Pfisterer B, Harden SM, Epstein D, Hirschmann JM, Wunsch K, Buman MP.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 May 4;11:e43162. doi: 10.2196/43162.,Stecher C,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/05/04,PMC10196895,,10.2196/43162,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps can promote physical activity; however, the pragmatic nature (ie, how well research translates into real-world settings) of these studies is unknown. The impact of study design choices, for example, intervention duration, on intervention effect sizes is also understudied. OBJECTIVE: This review and meta-analysis aims to describe the pragmatic nature of recent mHealth interventions for promoting physical activity and examine the associations between study effect size and pragmatic study design choices. METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases were searched until April 2020. Studies were eligible if they incorporated apps as the primary intervention, were conducted in health promotion or preventive care settings, included a device-based physical activity outcome, and used randomized study designs. Studies were assessed using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) and Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2 (PRECIS-2) frameworks. Study effect sizes were summarized using random effect models, and meta-regression was used to examine treatment effect heterogeneity by study characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 3555 participants were included across 22 interventions, with sample sizes ranging from 27 to 833 (mean 161.6, SD 193.9, median 93) participants. The study populations' mean age ranged from 10.6 to 61.5 (mean 39.6, SD 6.5) years, and the proportion of males included across all studies was 42.8% (1521/3555). Additionally, intervention lengths varied from 2 weeks to 6 months (mean 60.9, SD 34.9 days). The primary app- or device-based physical activity outcome differed among interventions: most interventions (17/22, 77%) used activity monitors or fitness trackers, whereas the rest (5/22, 23%) used app-based accelerometry measures. Data reporting across the RE-AIM framework was low (5.64/31, 18%) and varied within specific dimensions (Reach=44%; Effectiveness=52%; Adoption=3%; Implementation=10%; Maintenance=12.4%). PRECIS-2 results indicated that most study designs (14/22, 63%) were equally explanatory and pragmatic, with an overall PRECIS-2 score across all interventions of 2.93/5 (SD 0.54). The most pragmatic dimension was flexibility (adherence), with an average score of 3.73 (SD 0.92), whereas follow-up, organization, and flexibility (delivery) appeared more explanatory with means of 2.18 (SD 0.75), 2.36 (SD 1.07), and 2.41 (SD 0.72), respectively. An overall positive treatment effect was observed (Cohen d=0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.46). Meta-regression analyses revealed that more pragmatic studies (-0.81, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.25) were associated with smaller increases in physical activity. Treatment effect sizes were homogenous across study duration, participants' age and gender, and RE-AIM scores. CONCLUSIONS: App-based mHealth physical activity studies continue to underreport several key study characteristics and have limited pragmatic use and generalizability. In addition, more pragmatic interventions observe smaller treatment effects, whereas study duration appears to be unrelated to the effect size. Future app-based studies should more comprehensively report real-world applicability, and more pragmatic approaches are needed for maximal population health impacts.

Digital Health Interventions for Cardiac Rehabilitation: Systematic Literature Review,"Wongvibulsin S, Habeos EE, Huynh PP, Xun H, Shan R, Porosnicu Rodriguez KA, Wang J, Gandapur YK, Osuji N, Shah LM, Spaulding EM, Hung G, Knowles K, Yang WE, Marvel FA, Levin E, Maron DJ, Gordon NF, Martin SS.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Feb 8;23(2):e18773. doi: 10.2196/18773.,Wongvibulsin S,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/02/08,PMC7899799,,10.2196/18773,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite strong evidence supporting the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), over 80% of eligible patients do not participate in CR. Digital health technologies (ie, the delivery of care using the internet, wearable devices, and mobile apps) have the potential to address the challenges associated with traditional facility-based CR programs, but little is known about the comprehensiveness of these interventions to serve as digital approaches to CR. Overall, there is a lack of a systematic evaluation of the current literature on digital interventions for CR. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an in-depth analysis of the potential of digital health technologies to address the challenges associated with traditional CR. Through this review, we aim to summarize the current literature on digital interventions for CR, identify the key components of CR that have been successfully addressed through digital interventions, and describe the gaps in research that need to be addressed for sustainable and scalable digital CR interventions. METHODS: Our strategy for identifying the primary literature pertaining to CR with digital solutions (defined as technology employed to deliver remote care beyond the use of the telephone) included a consultation with an expert in the field of digital CR and searches of the PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases for original studies published from January 1990 to October 2018. RESULTS: Our search returned 31 eligible studies, of which 22 were randomized controlled trials. The reviewed CR interventions primarily targeted physical activity counseling (31/31, 100%), baseline assessment (30/31, 97%), and exercise training (27/31, 87%). The most commonly used modalities were smartphones or mobile devices (20/31, 65%), web-based portals (18/31, 58%), and email-SMS (11/31, 35%). Approximately one-third of the studies addressed the CR core components of nutrition counseling, psychological management, and weight management. In contrast, less than a third of the studies addressed other CR core components, including the management of lipids, diabetes, smoking cessation, and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Digital technologies have the potential to increase access and participation in CR by mitigating the challenges associated with traditional, facility-based CR. However, previously evaluated interventions primarily focused on physical activity counseling and exercise training. Thus, further research is required with more comprehensive CR interventions and long-term follow-up to understand the clinical impact of digital interventions."
mHealth Intervention for Vietnamese Living With Diabetes: Protocol for a Stepped Wedge Pilot Study,"Nguyen A, Nagykaldi Z, Bui T, Chen S, Businelle M, Eschiti V, Dwyer K.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Sep 28;12:e48585. doi: 10.2196/48585.,Nguyen A,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/09/28,PMC10570894,,10.2196/48585,"BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates participation in a diabetes self-management education and support program improves self-care behaviors and hemoglobin A(1c). Language and cultural differences may be barriers to program participation resulting in ineffective self-management, but these factors can be addressed with appropriate interventions. Given the high health care costs associated with diabetes complications, we developed a multicomponent, culturally tailored Self-Management Mobile Health Intervention for US Vietnamese With Diabetes (SMart-D). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the SMart-D intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness with intentions to scale up the intervention in the future. This mixed methods study incorporates the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework to evaluate the intervention. METHODS: This stepped wedge randomized controlled pilot study will be conducted over 2 years in collaboration with primary care clinics. Eligible participants are patients with type 2 diabetes who are receiving health care from participating clinics. Clinics will be randomly assigned to an implementation date and will begin with patients enrolling in the control period while receiving standard care, then cross over to the intervention period where patients receive standard care plus the SMart-D intervention for over 12 weeks. Focus groups or interviews will be conducted with clinicians and patients after study completion. Qualitative data will be analyzed using NVivo. Outcomes on self-care behavior changes will be measured with the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities scale and clinical changes will be measured using laboratory tests. A generalized linear mixed-effect model will be used to compute time effect, clustering effect, and the interaction of the control and intervention periods using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). RESULTS: We hypothesize that (1) at least 50% (n=5) of eligible clinics and 50% (n=40) of eligible patients who are invited will participate, and at least 70% (n=56) of patients will complete the program, and (2) patients who receive the intervention will have improved self-care behaviors and clinical test results with at least 75% (n=60) of the patients maintaining improved outcomes at follow-up visits compared with baseline, and participants will verbalize that the intervention is feasible and acceptable. As of August 2023, we enrolled 10 clinics and 60 patients. Baseline data results will be available by the end of 2023 and outcome data will be published in 2025. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Vietnamese diabetes self-management education and support intervention that leverages mobile health technology to address the barriers of language and culture differences through collaboration with primary care clinics. This study will provide a better understanding of the implementation process, demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the intervention, accelerate the pace of moving evidence-based interventions to practice among the US Vietnamese population, and potentially provide a replicable implementation model that can be culturally adapted to other non-English speaking ethnic minorities.

Effectiveness of an app-based intervention for unintentional injury among caregivers of preschoolers: protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Ning P, Chen B, Cheng P, Yang Y, Schwebel DC, Yu R, Deng J, Li S, Hu G.",BMC Public Health. 2018 Jul 11;18(1):865. doi: 10.1186/s12889-018-5790-1.,Ning P,BMC Public Health,2018,2018/07/13,PMC6042388,,10.1186/s12889-018-5790-1,"BACKGROUND: Each year, over 15,000 preschoolers die from unintentional injuries in China. Many interventions proven to work in other nations have not been implemented nationwide in China. The rapid popularity of smartphones offers an opportunity to overcome this limitation and disseminate evidence-based interventions to the large population of China. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an app-based intervention for caregivers of preschoolers to prevent unintentional injury among young Chinese children. METHOD: A single-blinded, 6-month, parallel-group cluster randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation ratio will be conducted in Changsha, China. In total, 2626 caregivers of preschoolers ages 3-6 years old who own a smartphone will be recruited from 20 preschools. Clusters will be randomized at the preschool level and allocated to either the control group (routine education plus app-based parenting education excluding unintentional injury prevention) or the intervention group (routine education plus app-based parenting education including unintentional injury prevention). The app-based injury prevention program was developed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Haddon Matrix, the Mobile Learning framework, and a needs assessment. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up via app-based survey plus printed questionnaire survey. The primary outcome measure is unintentional injury incidence among preschoolers in the past 3 months. Secondary outcome measures include economic losses due to unintentional injury in the past 3 months, the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs), and parent's attitudes and behaviors concerning supervision to prevent preschooler unintentional injury in the past week. An intention-to-treat approach will be used to evaluate outcome measures. Chi-square tests will examine differences for outcome measures between groups at each time point and generalized estimation equations (GEE) will test the overall effectiveness of the app-based intervention. Missing outcome data will be imputed using the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM). DISCUSSION: This trial will examine evidence concerning the effectiveness of an innovative app-based intervention for caregivers of Chinese preschoolers. If effective, the app-based intervention could offer an effective population-based intervention option to cost-effectively promote unintentional injury prevention in countries and regions where injury control is under-supported.

Multiple searches were run of academic databases in 2018-2020, examining literature on mobile apps for peripartum mental health. Multiple searches were also run of the iOS and Android app stores in 2019 and 2020, looking at apps for peripartum mental health. Results were compared within the academic dataset as well within the commercial app dataset; the two datasets were also examined for overlap. The academic search results were notable for small sample sizes and heterogeneous endpoints. The app store search results were notable for apps of generally poor quality (as assessed by a modified Silberg scale). Very few of the mHealth interventions studied in the academic literature were available in the app store; very few of the apps from the commercial stores were supported by academic literature. The disconnect between academically developed apps and commercially available apps highlights the need for better collaboration between academia and industry. More collaboration between the two approaches may benefit both app developers and patients in this demographic moving forwards. Additionally, we present a set of practice guidelines for mHealth in perinatal psychiatry based on the trends identified in this review."
Implementation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in e-Mental Health Apps: Literature Review,"Denecke K, Schmid N, Nüssli S.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Mar 10;24(3):e27791. doi: 10.2196/27791.,Denecke K,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/03/10,PMC8949700,,10.2196/27791,"BACKGROUND: To address the matter of limited resources for treating individuals with mental disorders, e-mental health has gained interest in recent years. More specifically, mobile health (mHealth) apps have been suggested as electronic mental health interventions accompanied by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the therapeutic aspects of CBT that have been implemented in existing mHealth apps and the technologies used. From these, we aim to derive research gaps that should be addressed in the future. METHODS: Three databases were screened for studies on mHealth apps in the context of mental disorders that implement techniques of CBT: PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. The studies were independently selected by 2 reviewers, who then extracted data from the included studies. Data on CBT techniques and their technical implementation in mHealth apps were synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Of the 530 retrieved citations, 34 (6.4%) studies were included in this review. mHealth apps for CBT exploit two groups of technologies: technologies that implement CBT techniques for cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and problem solving (exposure is not yet realized in mHealth apps) and technologies that aim to increase user experience, adherence, and engagement. The synergy of these technologies enables patients to self-manage and self-monitor their mental state and access relevant information on their mental illness, which helps them cope with mental health problems and allows self-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: There are CBT techniques that can be implemented in mHealth apps. Additional research is needed on the efficacy of the mHealth interventions and their side effects, including inequalities because of the digital divide, addictive internet behavior, lack of trust in mHealth, anonymity issues, risks and biases for user groups and social contexts, and ethical implications. Further research is also required to integrate and test psychological theories to improve the impact of mHealth and adherence to the e-mental health interventions."

Usability Evaluations of Mobile Mental Health Technologies: Systematic Review,"Inal Y, Wake JD, Guribye F, Nordgreen T.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Jan 6;22(1):e15337. doi: 10.2196/15337.,Inal Y,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/01/07,PMC6971511,,10.2196/15337,"BACKGROUND: Many mobile health (mHealth) apps for mental health have been made available in recent years. Although there is reason to be optimistic about their effect on improving health and increasing access to care, there is a call for more knowledge concerning how mHealth apps are used in practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review the literature on how usability is being addressed and measured in mHealth interventions for mental health problems. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review through a search for peer-reviewed studies published between 2001 and 2018 in the following electronic databases: EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently assessed all abstracts against the inclusion and exclusion criteria, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 299 studies were initially identified based on the inclusion keywords. Following a review of the title, abstract, and full text, 42 studies were found that fulfilled the criteria, most of which evaluated usability with patients (n=29) and health care providers (n=11) as opposed to healthy users (n=8) and were directed at a wide variety of mental health problems (n=24). Half of the studies set out to evaluate usability (n=21), and the remainder focused on feasibility (n=10) or acceptability (n=10). Regarding the maturity of the evaluated systems, most were either prototypes or previously tested versions of the technology, and the studies included few accounts of sketching and participatory design processes. The most common reason referred to for developing mobile mental health apps was the availability of mobile devices to users, their popularity, and how people in general became accustomed to using them for various purposes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a detailed account of how evidence of usability of mHealth apps is gathered in the form of usability evaluations from the perspective of computer science and human-computer interaction, including how users feature in the evaluation, how the study objectives and outcomes are stated, which research methods and techniques are used, and what the notion of mobility features is for mHealth apps. Most studies described their methods as trials, gathered data from a small sample size, and carried out a summative evaluation using a single questionnaire, which indicates that usability evaluation was not the main focus. As many studies described using an adapted version of a standard usability questionnaire, there may be a need for developing a standardized mHealth usability questionnaire."

Epub 2019 Nov 1.,Almeida FA,Contemp Clin Trials,2020,2019/11/05,,,10.1016/j.cct.2019.105877,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes prevention remains a top public health priority; digital approaches are potential solutions to existing scalability and accessibility challenges. There remains a gap in our understanding of the relationship between effectiveness, costs, and potential for sustained implementation of digital diabetes prevention strategies within typical healthcare settings. PURPOSE: To describe the methods and design of a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of a digital diabetes prevention program (DPP) using the iPARIHS and RE-AIM frameworks. METHODS: The trial will contrast the effects of two DPP interventions: (1) small group, in-person class, and (2) a digital DPP consisting of small group support, personalized health coaching, digital tracking tools, and weekly behavior change curriculum. Each intervention includes personal action planning with a focus on key elements of the lifestyle intervention from the CDC National DPP. Adults at risk for diabetes (BMI >/=25 and 5.7% </= HbA1c </= 6.4) will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 241) or the small group (n = 241). Assessment of primary (HbA1c) and secondary (weight loss, costs, cardiovascular risk factors) outcomes will occur at baseline, 4, and 12 months. Additionally, the trial will explore the potential for future adoption, implementation, and sustainability of the digitally-based intervention within a regional healthcare system based on key informant interviews and assessments of organizational administrators and primary care physicians. CONCLUSION: This trial of a digital DPP will allow the research team to determine the relationships between reach, effectiveness, implementation, and costs."

Evaluations have noted that coverage of selected MNCH services to be delivered by the ASHAs is low. Reasons for low coverage are inadequate supervision and support to ASHAs apart from insufficient skills, poor quality of training, and complexity of tasks to be performed. The proposed study aims to implement and evaluate an innovative intervention based on mobile phone technology (mHealth) to improve the performance of ASHAs through better supervision and support in predominantly tribal and rural communities of Gujarat, India. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, stratified, cluster randomized trial of 36 months in which the units of randomization will be Primary Health Centers (PHCs). There are 11 PHCs in each arm. The intervention is a newly built mobile phone application used in the public health system and evaluated in three ways: (1) mobile phone as a job aid to ASHAs to increase coverage of MNCH services; (2) mobile phone as a job aid to ASHAs and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) to increase coverage of care among complicated cases by facilitating referrals, if indicated and home-based care; (3) web interface as a job aid for medical officers and PHC staff to improve supervision and support to the ASHA program. Participants of the study are pregnant women, mothers, infants, ASHAs, and PHC staff. Primary outcome measures are a composite index made of critical, proven MNCH services and the proportion of neonates who were visited by ASHAs at home within the first week of birth. Secondary outcomes include coverage of selected MNCH services and care sought by complicated cases. Outcomes will be measured by conducting household surveys at baseline and post-intervention which will be compared with usual practice in the control area, where the current level of services provided by the government will continue. The primary analysis will be intention to treat. DISCUSSION: This study will help answer some critical questions about the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing an mHealth solution in an area of MNCH services.

Efficacy of an Internet-based intervention for job stress and burnout among medical professionals: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Smoktunowicz E, Lesnierowska M, Cieslak R, Carlbring P, Andersson G.",Trials. 2019 Jun 10;20(1):338. doi: 10.1186/s13063-019-3401-9.,Smoktunowicz E,Trials,2019,2019/06/12,PMC6558742,,10.1186/s13063-019-3401-9,"BACKGROUND: Medical professionals are at high risk of job stress and burnout. Research shows that work-related stress can be reduced through enhancing psychological resources, in particular, self-efficacy and perceived social support. These psychological resources can operate either individually or sequentially: in line with the cultivation hypothesis, self-efficacy precedes and cultivates perceived social support, whereas according to the enabling hypothesis it is perceived social support that comes first and enables self-efficacy. Based on this theoretical framework we developed an internet-based intervention, Med-Stress, dedicated to healthcare providers and aimed at reducing job stress and burnout. Med-Stress contains two modules that enhance self-efficacy and perceived social support, which are tested in four variants reflected in four study conditions. We expect that sequential enhancement of resources: self-efficacy and social support or social support and self-efficacy will yield larger posttest results than individual enhancement. METHODS: In this four-arm randomized controlled trial we will test four variants of the Med-Stress intervention. The trial is open for professionally active medical providers aged at least 18 years (N = 1200) with access to an Internet-connected device. We will compare the effects of two experimental conditions reflecting cultivation and enabling effects of self-efficacy and perceived social support (sequential enhancement of resources), and two active controls strengthening self-efficacy or perceived social support. Job stress and job burnout will be the primary outcomes, whereas depression, job-related traumatic stress, and work engagement will be secondary ones. Additionally, we will measure perceived social support, self-efficacy to manage job stress and burnout, and the ability to obtain social support, exposure to traumatic events, and users' expectancy and credibility of the intervention. All assessments will be applied before the intervention, at posttest (at 3 or 6 weeks depending on the study condition), and at 6-month and 12-month follow up. In the case of experimental groups, additional measurements will be taken after enhancing each resource. DISCUSSION: Resource-based interventions are relatively context-free and could potentially benefit medical professionals across the field. If Med-Stress is successful, its most effective variant could be implemented in the healthcare system as a standalone, supportive tool for employees.

Rapid systematic review on developing web-based interventions to support people affected by cancer,"Cooke S, Nelson D, Green H, McPeake K, Gussy M, Kane R.",BMJ Open. 2022 Sep 6;12(9):e062026. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062026.,Cooke S,BMJ Open,2022,2023/01/23,PMC9454073,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062026,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically identify and explore the existing evidence to inform the development of web-based interventions to support people affected by cancer (PABC). DESIGN: A rapid review design was employed in accordance with the guidance produced by the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. A rapid review was chosen due to the need for a timely evidence synthesis to underpin the subsequent development of a digital resource (Shared Lives: Cancer) as part of an ongoing funded project. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: Keyword searches were performed in MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed literature that reported primary data on the development of web-based interventions designed to support PABC. The review included peer-reviewed studies published in English with no limits set on publication date or geography. Key outcomes included any primary data that reported on the design, usability, feasibility, acceptability, functionality and user experience of web-based resource development. RESULTS: Ten studies were identified that met the pre-specified eligibility criteria. All studies employed an iterative, co-design approach underpinned by either quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods. The findings were grouped into the following overarching themes: (1) exploring current evidence, guidelines and theory, (2) identifying user needs and preferences and (3) evaluating the usability, feasibility and acceptability of resources. Resources should be informed by the experiences of a wide range of end-users taking into consideration current guidelines and theory early in the design process. Resource design and content should be developed around the user's needs and preferences and evaluated through usability, feasibility or acceptability testing using quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods. CONCLUSION: The findings of this rapid review provide novel methodological insights into the approaches used to design web-based interventions to support PABC. Our findings have the potential to inform and guide researchers when considering the development of future digital health resources.

App-Delivered Self-Management Intervention Trial selfBACK for People With Low Back Pain: Protocol for Implementation and Process Evaluation,"Rasmussen CDN, Svendsen MJ, Wood K, Nicholl BI, Mair FS, Sandal LF, Mork PJ, Søgaard K, Bach K, Stochkendahl MJ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Oct 29;9(10):e20308. doi: 10.2196/20308.,Rasmussen CDN,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/10/29,PMC7661240,,10.2196/20308,"BACKGROUND: Implementation and process evaluation is vital for understanding how interventions function in different settings, including if and why interventions have different effects or do not work at all. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an implementation and process evaluation embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in Denmark and Norway (the selfBACK project). selfBACK is a data-driven decision support system that provides participants with weekly self-management plans for low back pain. These plans are delivered through a smartphone app and tailored to individual participants by using case-based reasoning methodology. In the trial, we compare selfBACK in addition to usual care with usual care alone. METHODS: The aim of this study is to conduct a convergent mixed-methods implementation and process evaluation of the selfBACK app by following the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework. We will evaluate the process of implementing selfBACK and investigate how participants use the intervention in daily life. The evaluation will also cover the reach of the intervention, health care provider willingness to adopt it, and participant satisfaction with the intervention. We will gather quantitative measures by questionnaires and measures of data analytics on app use and perform a qualitative exploration of the implementation using semistructured interviews theoretically informed by normalization process theory. Data collection will be conducted between March 2019 and October 2020. RESULTS: The trial opened for recruitment in February 2019. This mixed-methods implementation and evaluation study is embedded in the randomized controlled trial and will be collecting data from March 2019 to October 2020; dissemination of trial results is planned thereafter. The results from the process evaluation are expected 2021-2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide a detailed understanding of how self-management of low back pain can be improved and how a digital health intervention can be used as an add-on to usual care to support patients to self-manage their low back pain. We will provide knowledge that can be used to explore the possibilities of extending the generic components of the selfBACK system and key drivers that could be of use in other conditions and diseases where self-management is an essential prevention or treatment strategy.

Given that these habits have a large public health impact and influence the increasing rates of childhood obesity worldwide, there is a need for effective, evidence-based prevention trials promoting healthy eating habits in the first 2 years of life. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the effect of an eHealth intervention called Food4toddlers, aiming to promote healthy dietary habits in toddlers by targeting parents' awareness of their child's food environment (i.e., how food is provided or presented) and eating environment (e.g., feeding practices and social interaction). This paper describes the rationale, development, and evaluation design of this project. METHODS/DESIGN: We developed a 6-month eHealth intervention, with the extensive user involvement of health care nurses and parents of toddlers. This intervention is in line with the social cognitive theory, targeting the interwoven relationship between the person, behavior, and environment, with an emphasis on environmental factors. The intervention website includes recipes, information, activities, and collaboration opportunities. The Food4toddlers website can be used as a mobile application. To evaluate the intervention, a two-armed pre-post-follow-up randomized controlled trial is presently being conducted in Norway. Parents of toddlers (n = 404) were recruited via social media (Facebook) and 298 provided baseline data of their toddlers at age 12 months. After baseline measurements, participants were randomly allocated to an intervention group or control group. Primary outcomes are the child's diet quality and food variety. All participants will be followed up at age 18 months, 2 years, and 4 years. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide evidence to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention targeting parents and their toddler's dietary habits.

Ethical issues in m-Health applications in community health work in India - a scoping review,"Gopichandran V, Subramaniam S, Thiagesan R.",Indian J Med Ethics. 2023 Oct-Dec;VIII(4):266-273. doi: 10.20529/IJME.2023.037. Epub 2023 Jun 9.,Gopichandran V,Indian J Med Ethics,2023,2023/06/13,,,10.20529/IJME.2023.037,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone-based interventions are being increasingly used in community health work in India. The extensive use of mobile phones in community health work is associated with several ethical issues. This review was conducted to identify the ethical issues related to mHealth applications in community health work in India. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of literature in PubMed and Google Scholar using a search strategy that we developed. We included studies that mentioned ethical issues in mHealth applications that involved community health work and community health workers in India, published in peer reviewed English language journals between 2011 and 2021. All three authors screened the articles, shortlisted them, read them, and extracted the data. We then synthesised the data into a conceptual framework. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1125 papers, from which we screened and shortlisted 121, after reading which we included 58 in the final scoping review. The main ethical issues identified from review of these papers included benefits of mHealth applications such as improved quality of care, increased awareness about health and illness, increased accountability of the health system, accurate data capture and timely data driven decision making. The risks of mHealth applications identified were impersonal communication of community health worker, increased workload, potential breach in privacy, confidentiality, and stigmatisation. The inherent inequities in access to mobile phones in the community due to gender and class led to exclusion of women and the poor from the benefits of mHealth interventions. Though mHealth interventions increased access to healthcare by taking healthcare to remote areas through tele-health, unless we contextualise mHealth to local rural settings through community engagement, it is likely to remain inequitable. CONCLUSION: This scoping review revealed that there is a lack of well conducted empirical studies which explore the ethical issues related to mHealth applications in community health work."
"mHealth Strategies Related to HIV Postexposure Prophylaxis Knowledge and Access: Systematic Literature Review, Technology Prospecting of Patent Databases, and Systematic Search on App Stores","Queiroz AAFLN, Mendes IAC, de Godoy S, Velez Lapão L, Dias S.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2021 Feb 16;9(2):e23912. doi: 10.2196/23912.,Queiroz AAFLN,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2021,2021/02/16,PMC7925142,,10.2196/23912,"BACKGROUND: Globally, the number of HIV cases continue to increase, despite the development of multiple prevention strategies. New cases of HIV have been reported disproportionately more in men who have sex with men and other vulnerable populations. Issues such as internalized and structural homophobia prevent these men from accessing prevention strategies such as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are known to be one of the newest and preferred options to enhance PEP knowledge and access. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and analyze the mobile apps addressing PEP for HIV infections. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive exploratory study in 3 sequential phases: systematic literature review, patent analysis, and systematic search of app stores. For the systematic review, we followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines adapted for an integrative review in the databases of PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase, Science Direct, Eric, Treasure, and CINAHL. The patent analysis was performed by exploring the databases of the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the European Patent Office. For the systematic search, we analyzed mHealth apps related to HIV in 2 major app libraries, that is, Google Play Store and App Store. The apps were evaluated by name, characteristics, functions, and availability in iPhone operating system/Android phones. RESULTS: We analyzed 22 studies, of which 2 were selected for the final stage. Both studies present the use of apps as mHealth strategies aimed at improving the sexual health of men who have sex with men, and they were classified as decision support systems. The search in the patent databases showed only 1 result, which was not related to the topic since it was a drug intervention. In the app libraries, 25 apps were found and analyzed, with 15 (60%) apps available for Android systems but only 3 (12%) addressing PEP. In general, the apps inform about HIV and HIV prevention and treatment, with the focus users being health care providers, people with HIV, or the general population, but they have only limited features available, that is, mainly text, images, and videos. The 3 apps exclusively focusing on PEP were created by researchers from Brazilian universities. CONCLUSIONS: Our review found no connection between the scientific studies, registered patents, and the available apps related to PEP; this finding indicates that these available apps do not have a theoretical or a methodological background in their creation. Thus, since the scientific knowledge on HIV is not translated into technological products, preventing the emergence of new infections, especially in the more vulnerable groups, is difficult. In the future, researchers and the community must work in synergy to create more mHealth tools aimed at PEP."

This meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to explore the effect of app-assisted interventions on blood pressure (BP) control in Chinese adults and summarize the common functions of these apps. STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and China Biology Medicine database). The identified articles were reviewed independently by two researchers. A random-effects model was used to compute the effect size. Studies were assessed for risk of bias and the transparency and quality of the apps. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (n = 2965) were included in the final analysis. App-based interventions achieved additional decreases in BP levels (systolic BP [SBP]: -8.12 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -11.47 to -4.77 mmHg, P < 0.001; diastolic BP [DBP]: -6.67 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.92 to -4.41 mmHg, P < 0.001). However, the results showed considerable heterogeneity (SBP: I(2) = 97%, P < 0.001; DBP: I(2) = 96%, P < 0.001). Four studies reported the BP control rate. The pooled results demonstrated a better control rate achieved via app-based interventions (risk ratio: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.49, P < 0.001) without heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%). The transparency and replicability assessment revealed unsatisfying results, and only three studies reported more than half of the 16 items in the mHealth checklist. Few studies described the replicability, data security, and infrastructure of the apps used. We identified 16 app functions, with the top three functions being doctor-patient communication (16/16), health education (15/16), and personalized guidance (12/16). CONCLUSIONS: We showed app-based interventions had a positive effect on BP management in Chinese adults. However, there was high heterogeneity among the included studies, which merits further exploration when more standardized research has been conducted. The functions of the apps varied widely, and further development of apps for BP management should abide by appropriate reporting guidelines."

Despite advances in treatment, there has been limited progress in addressing the burden at a population level. Accordingly, there has been growing interest in prevention approaches as an additional pathway to address depression. Depression can be prevented using evidence-based psychological programmes. However, barriers to implementing and accessing these programmes remain, typically reflecting a requirement for delivery by clinical experts and high associated delivery costs. Digital technologies, specifically smartphones, are now considered a key strategy to overcome the barriers inhibiting access to mental health programmes. The Future Proofing Study is a large-scale school-based trial investigating whether cognitive behaviour therapies (CBT) delivered by smartphone application can prevent depression. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial targeting up to 10,000 Year 8 Australian secondary school students will be conducted. In Stage I, schools will be randomised at the cluster level either to receive the CBT intervention app (SPARX) or to a non-active control group comparator. The primary outcome will be symptoms of depression, and secondary outcomes include psychological distress, anxiety and insomnia. At the 12-month follow-up, participants in the intervention arm with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in an individual-level randomised controlled trial (Stage II) and be randomised to receive a second CBT app which targets sleep difficulties (Sleep Ninja) or a control condition. Assessments will occur post intervention (both trial stages) and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post baseline. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach and compare changes in symptoms from baseline to follow-up relative to the control group using mixed-effect models. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial testing the effectiveness of smartphone apps delivered to school students to prevent depression at scale. Results from this trial will provide much-needed insight into the feasibility of this approach. They stand to inform policy and commission decisions concerning if and how such programmes should be deployed in school-based settings in Australia and beyond.

The purpose of this study was to systematically review CP-led digital interventions to improve patients' health-related clinical outcomes. PubMed and the Cochrane Database were searched to select studies that had conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate clinical outcomes in adults following a CP-led digital intervention for the period from January 2005 to August 2021. A total of 19 studies were included in our analysis. In these 19 studies, the most commonly used digital intervention by CPs was telephone use (n = 15), followed by a web-based tool (n = 2) and a mobile app (n = 2). These interventions were provided to serve a wide range of purposes in patients' outcomes: change in lab values (e.g., blood pressure, HbA1c) (n = 23), reduction in health service use (n = 8), enhancing adherence (n = 6), improvement in drug-related outcomes (n = 6), increase in survival (n = 3), and reduction in health-related risk (e.g., CVD risk) (n = 2). Although the impacts of telephone-based interventions on patients' outcomes were decidedly mixed, web-based interventions and mobile apps exerted generally positive influences. To date, little research has investigated the cost-effectiveness of digital interventions. Future studies are warranted."

Moreover, consecutive repeated data collection enables the development of predictive algorithms for substance use by machine learning methods. OBJECTIVE: We developed a new self-monitoring mobile app to record daily substance use, triggers, and cravings. Additionally, a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit) was used to collect objective biological and behavioral data before, during, and after substance use. This study aims to describe a model using machine learning methods to determine substance use. METHODS: This study is an ongoing observational study using a Fitbit and a self-monitoring app. Participants of this study were people with health risks due to alcohol or methamphetamine use. They were required to record their daily substance use and related factors on the self-monitoring app and to always wear a Fitbit for 8 weeks, which collected the following data: (1) heart rate per minute, (2) sleep duration per day, (3) sleep stages per day, (4) the number of steps per day, and (5) the amount of physical activity per day. Fitbit data will first be visualized for data analysis to confirm typical Fitbit data patterns for individual users. Next, machine learning and statistical analysis methods will be performed to create a detection model for substance use based on the combined Fitbit and self-monitoring data. The model will be tested based on 5-fold cross-validation, and further preprocessing and machine learning methods will be conducted based on the preliminary results. The usability and feasibility of this approach will also be evaluated. RESULTS: Enrollment for the trial began in September 2020, and the data collection finished in April 2021. In total, 13 people with methamphetamine use disorder and 36 with alcohol problems participated in this study. The severity of methamphetamine or alcohol use disorder assessed by the Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 or the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-10 was moderate to severe. The anticipated results of this study include understanding the physiological and behavioral data before, during, and after alcohol or methamphetamine use and identifying individual patterns of behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time data on daily life among people with substance use problems were collected in this study. This new approach to data collection might be helpful because of its high confidentiality and convenience. The findings of this study will provide data to support the development of interventions to reduce alcohol and methamphetamine use and associated negative consequences.

Assessing Patient Adherence to and Engagement With Digital Interventions for Depression in Clinical Trials: Systematic Literature Review,"Forbes A, Keleher MR, Venditto M, DiBiasi F.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Aug 11;25:e43727. doi: 10.2196/43727.,Forbes A,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/08/11,PMC10457707,,10.2196/43727,"BACKGROUND: New approaches to the treatment of depression are necessary for patients who do not respond to current treatments or lack access to them because of barriers such as cost, stigma, and provider shortage. Digital interventions for depression are promising; however, low patient engagement could limit their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This systematic literature review (SLR) assessed how participant adherence to and engagement with digital interventions for depression have been measured in the published literature, what levels of adherence and engagement have been reported, and whether higher adherence and increased engagement are linked to increased efficacy. METHODS: We focused on a participant population of adults (aged >/=18 years) with depression or major depressive disorder as the primary diagnosis and included clinical trials, feasibility studies, and pilot studies of digital interventions for treating depression, such as digital therapeutics. We screened 756 unique records from Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane published between January 1, 2000, and April 15, 2022; extracted data from and appraised the 94 studies meeting the inclusion criteria; and performed a primarily descriptive analysis. Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development & Commercialization, Inc (Princeton, New Jersey, United States) funded this study. RESULTS: This SLR encompassed results from 20,111 participants in studies using 47 unique web-based interventions (an additional 10 web-based interventions were not described by name), 15 mobile app interventions, 5 app-based interventions that are also accessible via the web, and 1 CD-ROM. Adherence was most often measured as the percentage of participants who completed all available modules. Less than half (44.2%) of the participants completed all the modules; however, the average dose received was 60.7% of the available modules. Although engagement with digital interventions was measured differently in different studies, it was most commonly measured as the number of modules completed, the mean of which was 6.4 (means ranged from 1.0 to 19.7) modules. The mean amount of time participants engaged with the interventions was 3.9 (means ranged from 0.7 to 8.4) hours. Most studies of web-based (34/45, 76%) and app-based (8/9, 89%) interventions found that the intervention group had substantially greater improvement for at least 1 outcome than the control group (eg, care as usual, waitlist, or active control). Of the 14 studies that investigated the relationship between engagement and efficacy, 9 (64%) found that increased engagement with digital interventions was significantly associated with improved participant outcomes. The limitations of this SLR include publication bias, which may overstate engagement and efficacy, and low participant diversity, which reduces the generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: Patient adherence to and engagement with digital interventions for depression have been reported in the literature using various metrics. Arriving at more standardized ways of reporting adherence and engagement would enable more effective comparisons across different digital interventions, studies, and populations."
A systematic review of mHealth interventions for the support of eating disorders,"Anastasiadou D, Folkvord F, Lupiañez-Villanueva F.",Eur Eat Disord Rev. 2018 Sep;26(5):394-416. doi: 10.1002/erv.2609. Epub 2018 Jun 21.,Anastasiadou D,Eur Eat Disord Rev,2018,2018/06/22,,,10.1002/erv.2609,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the existing evidence of mobile health (mHealth) tools for the treatment of eating disorders (ED). METHOD: Electronic databases (Pubmed, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS) were searched, and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Selected studies were divided into three categories according to the intended purpose of the mHealth tools used: (a) sole means of support, (b) complementary to standard face-to-face treatment, and (c) for relapse prevention. Additionally, studies were assessed on efficacy, qualitative information, and methodological quality. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were identified. Most studies using mHealth as a sole means of intervention or adjunct to traditional therapy showed no effects, although an improvement at postassessment was present in vodcast, smartphone application, and text-messaging interventions. Between group effects were only found for a text-messaging intervention for relapse prevention. Qualitative analyses showed that most mHealth interventions were considered as acceptable, supporting, and motivating by patients and therapists, although different important problems were observed in individual studies. CONCLUSIONS: Limited effects were found for mHealth interventions to reduce ED-related symptoms. A common evaluation framework for ED mHealth interventions should be proposed to assess the validity of interventions before implementing them on a larger scale in clinical practice."

DESIGN: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO registration number CRD42019139884. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Scopus between January 2010 and August 2019. Study Selection and Appraisal: Randomized control trials of digital health-led DSMES for Type 1 (T1DM) or 2 (T2DM) diabetes compared to usual care were included. Outcomes were change in HbA1c, diabetes knowledge, and HrQoL. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was used to assess bias and GRADEpro for overall quality. The analysis involved narrative synthesis, subgroup and pooled meta-analyses. RESULTS: From 4286 articles, 39 studies (6861 participants) were included. Mean age was 51.62 years, range (13-70). Meta-analysis revealed intervention effects on HbA1c for T2DM with difference in means (MD) from baseline -0.480% (-0.661, -0.299), I(2)75% (6 months), -0.457% (-0.761, -0.151), I(2) 81% (12 months), and for T1DM -0.41% (-1.022, 0.208) I(2) 83% (6 months), -0.03% (-0.210, 0.142) I(2) 0% (12 months). Few reported HrQoL with Hedges' g 0.183 (-0.039, 0.405), I(2) 0% (6 months), 0.153 (-0.060, 0.366), I(2) 0% (12 months) and diabetes knowledge with Hedges' g 1.003 (0.068, 1.938), I(2) 87% (3 months). CONCLUSION: Digital health-led DSMES are effective in improving HbA1c and diabetes knowledge, notably for T2DM. Research shows non-significant changes in HrQoL. Intervention effect on HbA1c was more impressive if delivered through mobile apps or patient portals. Further research is needed on the impact of DSMES on these outcomes, especially for newly diagnosed diabetes patients."
Digital health intervention on patient safety for children and parents: A scoping review,"Park J, Jeon H, Choi EK.",J Adv Nurs. 2024 May;80(5):1750-1760. doi: 10.1111/jan.15954. Epub 2023 Nov 10.,Park J,J Adv Nurs,2024,2023/11/11,,,10.1111/jan.15954,"AIM: To explore digital health interventions on patient safety for children and their parents. DESIGN: A scoping review. METHODS: The PCC 'Participants, Concepts, and Contexts' guided the selection of studies that focused on children under 19 years of age or their parents, patient safety interventions for children, and digital health technology for patient safety interventions. This study was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework's five steps. We reported the review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews Checklist. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane were searched for articles published up to November 2022. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles were included and categorized according to the following criteria to describe the results: intervention characteristics, type of digital technology, and outcome characteristics. Regarding intervention characteristics, we identified two categories, prevention and risk management. Additionally, we identified four types of digital technology, mobile applications, web-based technologies, computer kiosks and electronic health records. Finally, in studies focussing on child safety, parental safety behaviours were used to assess injury risk or detect changes related to prevention. CONCLUSION: Patient safety interventions provided through appropriate digital technologies should be developed to enhance continuum of care for children from hospitalization to home after discharge. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE: Digital health interventions can bolster the role of healthcare providers in patient safety in and out of hospitals, thus improving children's safety and quality of care. IMPACT: What problem did the study address? Although the various advantages of digital health technology have been demonstrated, the potential role of digital technology in patient safety interventions for children has not been explored. What were the main finding? Preventive patient safety interventions and risk management for children have been developed. Where and on whom will the research have an impact? Digital health interventions on patient safety can improve children's safety and quality of care by promoting non-face-to-face engagement of children and parents after discharge and expanding healthcare providers' roles.

Exploring Adherence to Pelvic Floor Muscle Training in Women Using Mobile Apps: Scoping Review,"Harper RC, Sheppard S, Stewart C, Clark CJ.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Nov 30;11:e45947. doi: 10.2196/45947.,Harper RC,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/11/30,PMC10722367,,10.2196/45947,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic floor dysfunction is a public health issue, with 1 in 3 women experiencing symptoms at some point in their lifetime. The gold standard of treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction is supervised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT); however, adherence to PFMT in women is poor. Mobile apps are increasingly being used in the National Health Service to enable equity in the distribution of health care and increase accessibility to services. However, it is unclear how PFMT mobile apps influence PFMT adherence in women. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify which behavior change techniques (BCTs) have been used in PFMT mobile apps, to distinguish the core ""capability, opportunity, and motivation"" (COM) behaviors targeted by the BCTs used in PFMT mobile apps, and to compare the levels of PFMT adherence in women between those using PFMT mobile apps and those receiving usual care. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature. Published quantitative literature that compared the use of a PFMT mobile app to a control group was included to address the objectives of the study. The electronic bibliographic databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro, along with CENTRAL. Studies were also identified from reference searching of systematic reviews. Original articles written in English from 2006 onward were included. Nonexperimental quantitative studies, qualitative studies, studies that use male participants, case studies, web-based interventions, and interventions that use vaginal probes were excluded. Narrative synthesis was conducted on eligible articles based on the aims of the study. RESULTS: Of the 114 records retrieved from the search, a total of 6 articles met the eligibility and inclusion criteria. The total number of participants in the studies was 471. All PFMT mobile apps used the BCT ""prompts and cues."" Opportunity was the core COM behavior targeted by the PFMT mobile apps. Higher levels of adherence to PFMT were observed among women using PFMT mobile apps. CONCLUSIONS: Digital ""prompts and cues"" are a BCT commonly used in PFMT mobile apps, and further research is required to practically assess whether a future randomized controlled trial that investigates the effectiveness of digital ""prompts and cues"" on PFMT adherence in women can be conducted."

Epub 2023 May 30.,Egger SM,Workplace Health Saf,2023,2023/05/31,PMC10503239,,10.1177/21650799231170872,"BACKGROUND: Persistent job-related stress can be harmful to physical and mental health and has a sizable financial burden on society. Face-to-face interventions are effective in reducing stress but have the disadvantage of high costs and time requirements. mHealth solutions may be an effective alternative to provide stress management interventions at work. Occupational health professionals need information on which mHealth apps are effective for employees to manage job-related stress. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of effective web- and app-based interventions for reduction of job-related stress and stress-related symptoms. METHOD: A literature review was conducted in the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, and IEEEXplore. FINDINGS: A total of 24 articles describing 19 products were found. All products showed effectiveness in trials in improving mental and/or physical health and reducing stress. Most products have a course-like structure with a duration from 1 to 8 weeks. The products use various methods such as psychoeducation and education on stress, cognitive restructuring, emotional regulation, problem-solving, goal setting, gratitude, breathing, or mindfulness techniques. Most products use more than one method and most mixed material such as text on web pages, text messages, videos, reading and audio material, and games. CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: Overall, effective mHealth products were identified for the intervention of acute and chronic stress. Occupational health practitioners can use these 19 evidence-based mHealth products when advising organizations on health promotion of employees to reduce stress symptoms and promote health and well-being."
Barriers to and Facilitators of User Engagement With Digital Mental Health Interventions: Systematic Review,"Borghouts J, Eikey E, Mark G, De Leon C, Schueller SM, Schneider M, Stadnick N, Zheng K, Mukamel D, Sorkin DH.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Mar 24;23(3):e24387. doi: 10.2196/24387.,Borghouts J,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/03/24,PMC8074985,,10.2196/24387,"BACKGROUND: Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), which deliver mental health support via technologies such as mobile apps, can increase access to mental health support, and many studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving symptoms. However, user engagement varies, with regard to a user's uptake and sustained interactions with these interventions. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify common barriers and facilitators that influence user engagement with DMHIs. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Empirical studies that report qualitative and/or quantitative data were included. RESULTS: A total of 208 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles used a variety of methodologies, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, field studies, and analysis of user reviews. Factors extracted for coding were related to the end user, the program or content offered by the intervention, and the technology and implementation environment. Common barriers included severe mental health issues that hampered engagement, technical issues, and a lack of personalization. Common facilitators were social connectedness facilitated by the intervention, increased insight into health, and a feeling of being in control of one's own health. CONCLUSIONS: Although previous research suggests that DMHIs can be useful in supporting mental health, contextual factors are important determinants of whether users actually engage with these interventions. The factors identified in this review can provide guidance when evaluating DMHIs to help explain and understand user engagement and can inform the design and development of new digital interventions."
The Use of Mobile Apps and SMS Messaging as Physical and Mental Health Interventions: Systematic Review,"Rathbone AL, Prescott J.",J Med Internet Res. 2017 Aug 24;19(8):e295. doi: 10.2196/jmir.7740.,Rathbone AL,J Med Internet Res,2017,2017/08/26,PMC5590007,,10.2196/jmir.7740,"BACKGROUND: The initial introduction of the World Wide Web in 1990 brought around the biggest change in information acquisition. Due to the abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic. A substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily available to download concerning a wide range of health issues. mHealth has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments; eradicate the need to meet in person with a clinician, successively diminishing the workload of mental health professionals; be more cost effective to practices; and encourage self-care tactics. Previous research has given valid evidence with empirical studies proving the effectiveness of physical and mental health interventions using mobile apps. Alongside apps, there is evidence to show that receiving short message service (SMS) messages, which entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a patient's mental and physical well-being. Available mHealth apps and SMS services and their ever improving quality necessitates a systematic review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence to intervention, and usability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to study the efficacy, usability, and feasibility of mobile apps and SMS messages as mHealth interventions for self-guided care. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in JMIR, PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and SAGE. The search spanned from January 2008 to January 2017. The primary outcome measures consisted of weight management, (pregnancy) smoking cessation, medication adherence, depression, anxiety and stress. Where possible, adherence, feasibility, and usability outcomes of the apps or SMS services were evaluated. Between-group and within-group effect sizes (Cohen d) for the mHealth intervention method group were determined. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies, inclusive of 4658 participants were reviewed. The papers included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=19), within-group studies (n=7), and 1 within-group study with qualitative aspect. Studies show improvement in physical health and significant reductions of anxiety, stress, and depression. Within-group and between-group effect sizes ranged from 0.05-3.37 (immediately posttest), 0.05-3.25 (1-month follow-up), 0.08-3.08 (2-month follow-up), 0.00-3.10 (3-month follow-up), and 0.02-0.27 (6-month follow-up). Usability and feasibility of mHealth interventions, where reported, also gave promising, significant results. CONCLUSIONS: The review shows the promising and emerging efficacy of using mobile apps and SMS text messaging as mHealth interventions."
Current reporting of usability and impact of mHealth interventions for substance use disorder: A systematic review,"Carreiro S, Newcomb M, Leach R, Ostrowski S, Boudreaux ED, Amante D.",Drug Alcohol Depend. 2020 Oct 1;215:108201. doi: 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108201.

This review aims to describe the current landscape, effectiveness and usability of connected interventions for SUD. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify articles evaluating connected health interventions for SUD in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, IEEE, and Scopus) were searched over a five-year period. Included articles described a connected health intervention targeting SUD and provided outcomes data. Data were extracted using a standardized reporting tool. RESULTS: A total of 1676 unique articles were identified during the initial search, with 32 articles included in the final analysis. Seven articles of the 32 were derived from two large studies. The most commonly studied SUD was alcohol use disorder. Sixteen articles reported at least one statistically significant result with respect to reduced craving and/or substance use. The majority of articles used ecological momentary assessment to trigger interventions, while four used biologic/physiologic data. Two articles used a wearable device. Common intervention types included craving management, coping assistance, and tailored feedback. Twenty-three articles measured usability factors, and acceptability was generally reported as high. CONCLUSION: Identified themes included a focus on AUD, use of smart phones, use of EMA for intervention delivery, positive effects on SUD related outcomes, and overall high acceptability. Wearables that directly monitor biologic data and predictive analytics using integrated data streams represent understudied opportunities for new research."
Assessment of Psychological Distress in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Through Technologies: Literature Review,"Bassi G, Gabrielli S, Donisi V, Carbone S, Forti S, Salcuni S.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Jan 7;23(1):e17740. doi: 10.2196/17740.,Bassi G,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/01/07,PMC7819779,,10.2196/17740,"BACKGROUND: The use of technological devices can support the self-management of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly in addressing psychological distress. However, there is poor consistency in the literature regarding the use of psychological instruments for the web-based screening of patients' psychological distress and subsequent monitoring of their psychological condition during digital interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review previous literature on the types of psychological instruments delivered in digital interventions for assessing depression, anxiety, and stress in patients with T2DM. METHODS: The literature review was conducted using the PsycINFO, CINAHL and PubMed databases, in which the following terms were considered: diabetes mellitus, measure, assessment, self-care, self-management, depression, anxiety, stress, technology, eHealth, mobile health, mobile phone, device, and smartphone. RESULTS: In most studies, psychological assessments were administered on paper. A few studies deployed self-reporting techniques employing automated telephonic assessment, a call system for screening and monitoring patients' conditions and preferences, or through telephone interviews via interactive voice response calls, a self-management support program leveraging tailored messages and structured emails. Other studies used simple telephone interviews and included the use of apps for tablets and smartphones to assess the psychological well-being of patients. Finally, some studies deployed mood rating scales delivered through tailored text message-based support systems. CONCLUSIONS: The deployment of appropriate psychological tools in digital interventions allows researchers and clinicians to make the screening of anxiety, stress, and depression symptoms faster and easier in patients with T2DM. Data from this literature review suggest that mobile health solutions may be preferred tools to use in such digital interventions."
Content features and its implementation in novel app-based psycho-oncological interventions for cancer survivors: a narrative review,"Springer F, Mehnert-Theuerkauf A.",Curr Opin Oncol. 2022 Jul 1;34(4):313-319. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000836.,Springer F,Curr Opin Oncol,2022,2022/07/15,,,10.1097/CCO.0000000000000836,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The interest in and availability of app-based psycho-oncological interventions for cancer survivors has grown rapidly. In this narrative review, we therefore aim to provide an overview of the psychological content features included in psycho-oncological apps and how the content is implemented in the apps. RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 19 studies (six randomized controlled trials, six studies with prepost design, five study protocols and two app developments), all published in the last 18 months (July 2020 to December 2021), were analyzed in terms of the described app-based interventions and their psycho-oncological content. Apps for cancer survivors are conducted for a variety of different diagnoses and often target a specific patient population, for example patients with a specific therapy. The most frequent content features are psychoeducation, self-monitoring of symptoms, and some sort of exercise or relaxation program. Depending on the app's purpose, some offer specific content, such as decision aids, medication schedules or modules to improve coping strategies. Most apps combine informative and interactive elements. SUMMARY: Psycho-oncological apps for cancer survivors target many relevant psychological problem areas and aim to improve patient empowerment. Available mHealth interventions can therefore be seen as a good complement for cancer care and also offer the possibility to improve patient involvement."
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions in prostate cancer survivorship: a scoping review,"Ogunsanya ME, Sifat M, Bamidele OO, Ezenwankwo EF, Clifton S, Ton C, Knight JM, Odedina FT, Greer JA, Dwyer K, Kendzor DE.",J Cancer Surviv. 2023 Jun;17(3):557-568. doi: 10.1007/s11764-022-01328-3.

METHODS: The scoping review was conducted using the five-step framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. Using predefined criteria, we screened citations from Embase, EBSCOHost, Cochrane Library, PubMed, ProQuest, SCOPUS, and Web of Science for primary studies published before December 2021. We selected studies that explored the application of mHealth technology in CaP management and survivorship. Evidence from 14 eligible studies was summarized using narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Fourteen studies published between 2015 and 2021 were included. Ten mHealth apps were identified with only one still in use. Most apps were explored for their supportive care roles during radiotherapy (n = 9) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (n = 1) treatment, mainly to assess outcomes (n = 1) and manage patient-reported symptoms (n = 5). One study deployed mHealth to facilitate recovery after surgery. Very few studies (n = 3) applied mHealth for lifestyle management (i.e., physical activity). Barriers to app usage included connectivity issues, end-user familiarity with the app, login hurdles, and time constraints. Facilitators of app usage included apps being downloaded for participants, devices provided for participants, and the ability to connect with providers through the platform. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The improving survival rates from CaP suggest that men are now living longer with unfavorable treatment side effects such as reduced sexual functioning, pain, and fatigue. Hence, mHealth represents new hope in men's illness trajectory. However, current application in patients' care pathways remains poor, particularly in the active phase of CaP management. Efforts must be accelerated to explore individual and healthcare-level drivers of mHealth use. The feasibility and descriptive nature of current studies point to a lack of attention to actual implementation and scale-up issues in research considering mHealth application in CaP, hence accounting partly for the gap in research/practice."
Design Features Associated With Engagement in Mobile Health Physical Activity Interventions Among Youth: Systematic Review of Qualitative and Quantitative Studies,"Schwarz A, Winkens LHH, de Vet E, Ossendrijver D, Bouwsema K, Simons M.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Mar 6;11:e40898. doi: 10.2196/40898.,Schwarz A,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/03/06,PMC10028523,,10.2196/40898,"BACKGROUND: Globally, 81% of youth do not meet the physical activity (PA) guidelines. Youth of families with a low socioeconomic position are less likely to meet the recommended PA guidelines. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are preferred by youth over traditional in-person approaches and are in line with their media preferences. Despite the promise of mHealth interventions in promoting PA, a common challenge is to engage users in the long term or effectively. Earlier reviews highlighted the association of different design features (eg, notifications and rewards) with engagement among adults. However, little is known about which design features are important for increasing engagement among youth. OBJECTIVE: To inform the design process of future mHealth tools, it is important to investigate the design features that can yield effective user engagement. This systematic review aimed to identify which design features are associated with engagement in mHealth PA interventions among youth who were aged between 4 and 18 years. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in EBSCOhost (MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, and Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection) and Scopus. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included if they documented design features associated with engagement. Design features and related behavior change techniques and engagement measures were extracted. Study quality was assessed according to the Mixed Method Assessment Tool, and one-third of all screening and data extraction were double coded by a second reviewer. RESULTS: Studies (n=21) showed that various features were associated with engagement, such as a clear interface, rewards, multiplayer game mode, social interaction, variety of challenges with personalized difficulty level, self-monitoring, and variety of customization options among others, including self-set goals, personalized feedback, progress, and a narrative. In contrast, various features need to be carefully considered while designing mHealth PA interventions, such as sounds, competition, instructions, notifications, virtual maps, or self-monitoring, facilitated by manual input. In addition, technical functionality can be considered as a prerequisite for engagement. Research addressing youth from low socioeconomic position families is very limited with regard to engagement in mHealth apps. CONCLUSIONS: Mismatches between different design features in terms of target group, study design, and content translation from behavior change techniques to design features are highlighted and set up in a design guideline and future research agenda.

Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression: Scoping Review of User Engagement,"Lipschitz JM, Van Boxtel R, Torous J, Firth J, Lebovitz JG, Burdick KE, Hogan TP.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Oct 14;24(10):e39204. doi: 10.2196/39204.,Lipschitz JM,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/10/14,PMC9617183,,10.2196/39204,"BACKGROUND: While many digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been found to be efficacious, patient engagement with DMHIs has increasingly emerged as a concern for implementation in real-world clinical settings. To address engagement, we must first understand what standard engagement levels are in the context of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and how these compare with other treatments. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to examine the state of reporting on intervention engagement in RCTs of mobile app-based interventions intended to treat symptoms of depression. We sought to identify what engagement metrics are and are not routinely reported as well as what the metrics that are reported reflect about standard engagement levels. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of 7 databases to identify studies meeting our eligibility criteria, namely, RCTs that evaluated use of a mobile app-based intervention in adults, for which depressive symptoms were a primary outcome of interest. We then extracted 2 kinds of information from each article: intervention details and indices of DMHI engagement. A 5-element framework of minimum necessary DMHI engagement reporting was derived by our team and guided our data extraction. This framework included (1) recommended app use as communicated to participants at enrollment and, when reported, app adherence criteria; (2) rate of intervention uptake among those assigned to the intervention; (3) level of app use metrics reported, specifically number of uses and time spent using the app; (4) duration of app use metrics (ie, weekly use patterns); and (5) number of intervention completers. RESULTS: Database searching yielded 2083 unique records. Of these, 22 studies were eligible for inclusion. Only 64% (14/22) of studies included in this review specified rate of intervention uptake. Level of use metrics was only reported in 59% (13/22) of the studies reviewed. Approximately one-quarter of the studies (5/22, 23%) reported duration of use metrics. Only half (11/22, 50%) of the studies reported the number of participants who completed the app-based components of the intervention as intended or other metrics related to completion. Findings in those studies reporting metrics related to intervention completion indicated that between 14.4% and 93.0% of participants randomized to a DMHI condition completed the intervention as intended or according to a specified adherence criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that engagement was underreported and widely varied. It was not uncommon to see completion rates at or below 50% (11/22) of those participants randomized to a treatment condition or to simply see completion rates not reported at all. This variability in reporting suggests a failure to establish sufficient reporting standards and limits the conclusions that can be drawn about level of engagement with DMHIs. Based on these findings, the 5-element framework applied in this review may be useful as a minimum necessary standard for DMHI engagement reporting."
A randomized controlled efficacy trial of an mHealth HIV prevention intervention for sexual minority young men: MyPEEPS mobile study protocol,"Kuhns LM, Garofalo R, Hidalgo M, Hirshfield S, Pearson C, Bruce J, Batey DS, Radix A, Belkind U, Jia H, Schnall R.",BMC Public Health. 2020 Jan 15;20(1):65. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-8180-4.,Kuhns LM,BMC Public Health,2020,2020/01/17,PMC6964028,,10.1186/s12889-020-8180-4,"BACKGROUND: Young sexual minority men in the United States have a high incidence rate of HIV infection. Early intervention among this group, that is timed to precede or coincide with sexual initiation, is of critical importance to prevent HIV infection. Despite this, there are very few published randomized controlled efficacy trials testing interventions to reduce sexual vulnerability for HIV acquisition among racially/ethnically diverse, very young, sexual minority men (aged </=18 years). This paper describes the design of a mobile app-based intervention trial to reduce sexual risk for HIV acquisition and promote health protection in this group. METHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial of an mHealth-based HIV prevention intervention, MyPEEPS Mobile, among diverse sexual minority cisgender young men, aged 13-18 years. The mobile intervention was adapted from a prior group-based intervention curriculum with evidence of efficacy, designed to be specific to the risk contexts and realities of young sexual minority men, and to include psychoeducational and skill-building components with interactive games and activities. Participants are recruited locally within four regional hubs (Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, New York City, NY, Seattle, WA) and nationwide via the Internet, enrolled in-person or remotely (via videoconference), and randomized (1:1) to either the MyPEEPS Mobile intervention or delayed intervention condition. Post-hoc stratification by age, race/ethnicity, and urban/suburban vs. rural statuses is used to ensure diversity in the sample. The primary outcomes are number of male anal sex partners and frequency of sexual acts with male partners (with and without condoms), sex under the influence of substances, and uptake of pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections at 3-, 6- and 9-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: Behavioral interventions for very young sexual minority men are needed to prevent sexual risk early in their sexual development and maturation. This study will provide evidence to determine feasibility and efficacy of a mobile app-based HIV prevention intervention to reduce sexual risk among this very young group.

Predictors of Adherence to Cancer-Related mHealth Apps in Cancer Patients Undergoing Oncological or Follow-Up Treatment-A Scoping Review,"Armbruster C, Knaub M, Farin-Glattacker E, von der Warth R.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Oct 21;19(20):13689. doi: 10.3390/ijerph192013689.,Armbruster C,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022,2022/10/27,PMC9603736,,10.3390/ijerph192013689,"mHealth interventions in cancer care are being increasingly applied in various settings. Nevertheless, there is a phenomenon wherein individuals show different usage patterns, which could affect the effectiveness of the intervention. In general, it is important to know the predictors of app adherence and usage patterns to improve the design and content (i.e., tailoring). The aim of this scoping review was to provide an overview of predictors of adherence to cancer-related mHealth apps in cancer patients. A systematic literature search was conducted in March 2021 in the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychINFO without limitation in year, focusing on cancer patients undergoing oncological or follow-up treatment using mHealth apps. The initial database search yielded a total of N = 8035 records. After title, abstract, and full-text screening, 10 articles met inclusion criteria. Studies were published between 2013 and 2020. Studies focused on children and adolescents (2/10) as well as adults (8/10). The predictors identified could be categorized into sociodemographic variables, cancer-related factors and others. This study provides an initial insight into relevant predictors of app adherence in cancer patients. However, no clear predictor of increased app adherence was found. Further research of usage patterns is therefore needed so that mHealth interventions can be tailored during development."
Effectiveness of Telerehabilitation Interventions for Self-management of Tinnitus: Systematic Review,"Demoen S, Chalimourdas A, Timmermans A, Van Rompaey V, Vanderveken OM, Jacquemin L, Schlee W, Marneffe W, Luyten J, Gilles A, Michiels S.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Feb 9;25:e39076. doi: 10.2196/39076.,Demoen S,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/02/09,PMC9951082,,10.2196/39076,"BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a highly prevalent symptom affecting 10%-20% of the adult population. Most patients with tinnitus have chronic tinnitus, which can directly or indirectly disrupt their daily life and negatively affect the health-related quality of life. Therefore, patients with tinnitus are frequently in need of costly and time-consuming treatments. As an answer, telerehabilitation interventions are on a rise to promote self-management in patients with tinnitus and reduce their dependency on in-person care. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of the research concerning the effectiveness of telerehabilitation interventions for self-management of tinnitus. METHODS: This systematic review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies were eligible for inclusion if study participants were adult patients with complaints of primary subjective tinnitus and the study intervention comprised any possible telerehabilitation form for the self-management of tinnitus complaints. A search for eligible studies was conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to the assess risk of bias. RESULTS: In total, 29 articles were found eligible, and of these, 5 (17%) studied multiple telerehabilitation forms. Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment with guidance by a psychologist or audiologist was examined in 17 studies (n=1767), internet-based cognitive behavioral treatment without guidance was examined in 4 studies (n=940), self-help manuals were examined in 1 study (n=72), technological self-help devices were examined in 2 studies (n=82), smartphone apps were examined in 8 studies (n=284), and other internet-based interventions were examined in 2 studies (n=130). These rehabilitation categories were proven to be effective in decreasing tinnitus severity and relieving tinnitus distress as measured by tinnitus questionnaires such as Tinnitus Functional Index, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, or Tinnitus Reactions Questionnaire. However, dropout rates were often high (range 4%-71.4%). All studies reported between some concerns and high concerns of risk of bias, resulting in low to moderate certainty levels. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is low to moderate quality evidence that telerehabilitation interventions effectively reduce tinnitus severity and distress. These interventions form a possible tool to improve the self-management capacities of the patient and the accessibility of tinnitus care as a replacement or an addition to in-person care. Nevertheless, barriers such as lack of time, engagement, motivation, and openness of the patient causing high dropout should be considered.

Supporting Self-management and Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder With the PolarUs App (Alpha): Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study,"Michalak EE, Barnes SJ, Morton E, O'Brien HL, Murray G, Hole R, Meyer D.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Aug 4;11(8):e36213. doi: 10.2196/36213.,Michalak EE,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/08/04,PMC9389375,,10.2196/36213,"BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly being recognized as a key outcome of interventions for bipolar disorder (BD). Mobile phone apps can increase access to evidence-based self-management strategies and provide real-time support. However, although individuals with lived experiences desire support with monitoring and improving broader health domains, existing BD apps largely target mood symptoms only. Further, evidence from the broader mobile health (mHealth) literature has shown that the desires and goals of end users are not adequately considered during app development, and as a result, engagement with mental health apps is suboptimal. To capitalize on the potential of apps to optimize wellness in BD, there is a need for interventions developed in consultation with real-world users designed to support QoL self-monitoring and self-management. OBJECTIVE: This mixed methods pilot study was designed to evaluate the alpha version of the newly developed PolarUs app, developed to support QoL self-monitoring and self-management in people with BD. Co-designed using a community-based participatory research framework, the PolarUs app builds on the web-based adaptation of a BD-specific QoL self-assessment measure and integrates material from a web-based portal providing information on evidence-informed self-management strategies in BD. The primary objectives of this project were to evaluate PolarUs app feasibility (via behavioral use metrics), the impact of PolarUs (via the Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder scale, our primary outcome measure), and explore engagement with the PolarUs app (via quantitative and qualitative methods). METHODS: Participants will be residents of North America (N=150), aged >18 years, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision diagnosis of BD type 1, BD type 2, or BD not otherwise specified as assessed by structured diagnostic interview. An embedded mixed methods research design will be adopted; qualitative interviews with a purposefully selected subsample (approximately, n=30) of participants will be conducted to explore in more depth feasibility, impact, and engagement with the PolarUs app over the 12-week study period. RESULTS: At the time of publication of this protocol, the development of the alpha version of the PolarUs app was complete. Participant enrollment has begun in June 2022. Data collection is expected to be completed by December 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond contributing knowledge on the feasibility and impact of a novel app to support QoL and self-management in BD, this study will also provide new insights related to engagement with mHealth apps. Furthermore, it will function as a case study of successful co-design between people with BD, health care providers, and BD researchers, providing a template for the future use of community-based participatory research frameworks in mHealth intervention development. The results will be used to further refine the PolarUs app and inform the design of a larger clinical trial. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/36213."
Health Worker mHealth Utilization: A Systematic Review,"White A, Thomas DS, Ezeanochie N, Bull S.",Comput Inform Nurs. 2016 May;34(5):206-13. doi: 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000231.,White A,Comput Inform Nurs,2016,2016/03/09,PMC4860109,NIHMS753233,10.1097/CIN.0000000000000231,"This systematic review describes mHealth interventions directed at healthcare workers in low-resource settings from the PubMed database from March 2009 to May 2015. Thirty-one articles were selected for final review. Four categories emerged from the reviewed articles: data collection during patient visits, communication between health workers and patients, communication between health workers, and public health surveillance. Most studies used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess acceptability of use, barriers to use, changes in healthcare delivery, and improved health outcomes. Few papers included theory explicitly to guide development and evaluation of their mHealth programs. Overall, evidence indicated that mobile technology tools, such as smartphones and tablets, substantially benefit healthcare workers, their patients, and healthcare delivery. Limitations to mHealth tools included insufficient program use and sustainability, unreliable Internet and electricity, and security issues. Despite these limitations, this systematic review demonstrates the utility of using mHealth in low-resource settings and the potential for widespread health system improvements using technology."
A phase III wait-listed randomised controlled trial of novel targeted inter-professional clinical education intervention to improve cancer patients' reported pain outcomes (The Cancer Pain Assessment (CPAS) Trial): study protocol,"Phillips JL, Heneka N, Lovell M, Lam L, Davidson P, Boyle F, McCaffrey N, Fielding S, Shaw T.",Trials. 2019 Jan 18;20(1):62. doi: 10.1186/s13063-018-3152-z.,Phillips JL,Trials,2019,2019/01/20,PMC6339283,,10.1186/s13063-018-3152-z,"BACKGROUND: Variations in care models contribute to cancer pain being under-recognised and under-treated in half of all patients with cancer. International and national cancer pain management guidelines are achievable with minimal investment but require practice changes. While much of the cancer pain research over the preceding decades has focused on management interventions, little attention has been given to achieving better adherence to recommended cancer pain guideline screening and assessment practices. This trial aims to reduce unrelieved cancer pain by improving cancer and palliative doctors' and nurses' ('clinicians') pain assessment capabilities through a targeted inter-professional clinical education intervention delivered to participants' mobile devices ('mHealth'). METHODS: A wait-listed, randomised control trial design. Cancer and/or palliative care physicians and nurses employed at one of the six participating sites across Australia will be eligible to participate in this trial and, on enrolment, will be allocated to the active or wait-listed arm. Participants allocated to the active arm will be invited to complete the mHealth cancer pain assessment intervention. In this trial, mHealth is defined as medical or public health practice supported by mobile devices (i.e. phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants and other wireless devices). This mHealth intervention integrates three evidence-based elements, namely: the COM-B theoretical framework; spaced learning pedagogy; and audit and feedback. This intervention will be delivered via the QStream online platform to participants' mobile devices over four weeks. The trial will determine if a tailored mHealth intervention, targeting clinicians' cancer pain assessment capabilities, is effective in reducing self-reported cancer pain scores, as measured by a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). DISCUSSION: If this mHealth intervention is found to be effective, in addition to improving cancer pain assessment practices, it will provide a readily transferable evidence-based framework that could readily be applied to other evidence practice gaps and a scalable intervention that could be administered simultaneously to multiple clinicians across diverse geographical locations. Moreover, if found to be cost-effective, it will help transform clinical continuing professional development. In summary, this mHealth intervention will provide health services with an opportunity to offer an evidence-based, pedagogically robust, cost-effective, scalable training alternative.

Challenges With the Use of Digital Sham: Systematic Review and Recommendations,"Bos E, Preller KH, Kaur G, Malhotra P, Kharawala S, Motti D.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Oct 24;25:e44764. doi: 10.2196/44764.,Bos E,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/10/24,PMC10630857,,10.2196/44764,"BACKGROUND: Digital therapeutics (DTx) are software-based products that prevent, manage, or treat a medical condition and are delivered through a smartphone app, web application, or wearable device. Clinical trials assessing DTx pose challenges, foremost among which is designing appropriate digital shams (or digital placebos), which should ideally mimic DTx (in terms of design, components, and duration of treatment) while omitting the active principle or component. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our review was to understand how digital shams are being used in clinical research on DTx in neuroscience, which is the most common therapy area for DTx. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of DTx in neuroscience (including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) with a focus on controlled clinical trials involving digital shams. Studies were identified from trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the European Union Clinical Trials Register, and Trial Trove) and through structured searches in MEDLINE and Embase (both via the Embase website) and were limited to articles in English published from 2010 onward. These were supplemented by keyword-based searches in PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar and bibliographic searches. Studies assessing DTx in neuroscience (including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders) were included. Details related to the publication, DTx, comparator, patient population, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Our search criteria identified 461 neuroscience studies involving 213 unique DTx. Most DTx were extended reality based (86/213, 40.4%) or mobile device based (56/213, 26.3%); 313 were comparative, of which 68 (21.7%) used shams. The most common therapeutic areas assessed in these studies were stroke (42/213, 19.7%), depression (32/213, 15%), and anxiety (24/213, 11.3%). The most common treatments were cognitive behavioral therapy or behavioral therapy (67/213, 32.4%), physical rehabilitation (60/213, 28.2%), and cognitive training (41/213, 19.2%). We identified the following important issues related to the use of digital shams in neuroscience: shams were not validated before use in studies, they varied widely in design (from being nearly identical to the DTx to using different software programs altogether), and the level of patient engagement or satisfaction with the sham and the impact of the sham on study outcomes were infrequently reported. CONCLUSIONS: Digital shams are critical for the clinical development of DTx in neuroscience. Given the importance of sham controls in evaluating DTx efficacy, we provide recommendations on the key information that should be reported in a well-designed DTx trial and propose an algorithm to allow the correct interpretation of DTx study results. Sham-controlled studies should be routinely used in DTx trials-in early-phase studies-to help identify DTx active components and-in late-phase studies-to confirm the efficacy of DTx. The use of shams early in development will ensure that the appropriate sham control is used in later confirmatory trials."

OBJECTIVE: With the growing body of evidence supporting the use of eHealth interventions, the intention is to conduct a meta-analysis on various health outcomes of eHealth interventions among ischaemic heart disease (IHD) patients. METHODS: Based on PRISMA guidelines, eligible studies were searched through databases of Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, EBSCOHost, and SAGE (PROSPERO registration CRD42021290091). Inclusion criteria were English language and randomised controlled trials published between 2011 to 2021 exploring health outcomes that empower IHD patients with eHealth interventions. RevMan 5.4 was utilised for meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, and risk of bias (RoB) assessment while GRADE software for generating findings of physical health outcomes. Non-physical health outcomes were analysed using SWiM (synthesis without meta-analysis) method. RESULTS: This review included 10 studies, whereby, six studies with 895 participants' data were pooled for physical health outcomes. Overall, the RoB varied significantly across domains, with the majority was low risks, a substantial proportion of high risks and a sizeable proportion of unclear. With GRADE evidence of moderate to high quality, eHealth interventions improved low density lipoprotien (LDL) levels in IHD patients when compared to usual care after 12 months of interventions (SMD -0.26, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.06], I(2) = 0%, p = 0.01). Significance appraisal in each domain of the non-physical health outcomes found significant findings for medication adherence, physical activity and dietary behaviour, while half of the non-significant findings were found for other behavioural outcomes, psychological and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic Health interventions are found effective at lowering LDL cholesterol in long-term but benefits remain inconclusive for other physical and non-physical health outcomes for IHD patients. Integrating sustainable patient empowerment strategies with the advancement of eHealth interventions by utilising appropriate frameworks is recommended for future research."

Consistent and complex self-care is required on the part of patients to adequately adhere to medication and to the lifestyle changes that the disease necessitates. Mobile health (mHealth) is being increasingly incorporated in patient interventions in HF, as smartphones prove to be ideal platforms for patient education and self-help assistance. This systematic review aims to summarize and report on all studies that have tested the effect of mHealth on HF patient outcomes. Our search yielded 17 studies, namely 11 randomized controlled trials and six non-randomized prospective studies. In these, patients with the assistance of an mHealth intervention regularly measured their blood pressure and/or body weight and assessed their symptoms. The outcomes were mostly related to hospitalizations, clinical biomarkers, patients' knowledge about HF, quality of life (QoL) and quality of self-care. QoL consistently increased in patients who received mHealth interventions, while study results on all other outcomes were not as ubiquitously positive. The first mHealth interventions in HF were not universally successful in improving patient outcomes but provided valuable insights for patient-oriented application development. Future trials are expected to build on these insights and deploy applications that measurably assist HF patients."

This scoping review and scientometric analyses aimed to summarize the current state of research on the use of mHealth technology (mobile applications/web-based interventions) for self-management/education of adults with hip/knee OA, identify key research activities, and provide future directions on the development/usage of mHealth technology. METHODS: The Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework was employed, augmented with scientometric analyses. Six databases were searched from inception to 31 May 2021. Findings were reported according to the PRISMA extension for scoping review. Co-word, co-author, and co-citation scientometric analyses were conducted to examine the social and intellectual connections of the research field (e.g., research hotspots and researcher collaborations). RESULTS: Twenty mHealth programs for promoting self-management of hip/knee OA were identified. The programs mainly included exercises or directives on performance of exercises. Compared to no interventions, mHealth technology was usable and might be more effective in improving pain, physical function, and quality of life in individuals with OA. The scientometric analyses identified multiple co-occurring keywords that reflected conceptual properties of this research domain. Although some intellectual connections among authors, research articles, and journals were noted, there were insufficient international collaborations in this field. DISCUSSION: While individual small-scale studies highlighted promising short-term effects of mHealth technology in self-managing hip/knee OA, many mHealth technologies were developed without clinicians' and/or patients' contributions. Future mHealth programs should be developed based on a strong theoretical background and professional inputs. The long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of mHealth technologies, user experience, as well as cross-cultural adaptation of these technologies should be evaluated."

Digital interventions to improve adherence for youth with asthma exist and have the potential to improve accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and customizability. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published research examining digital interventions to promote adherence to the treatment of pediatric asthma. METHODS: A systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and reference review databases was conducted. Articles were included if adherence was an outcome in a randomized controlled trial of a digital intervention for children with asthma. We compared samples, intervention characteristics, adherence measurement and outcomes, as well as additional health outcomes across studies. RESULTS: Of the 264 articles reviewed, 15 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Overall, 87% of the digital interventions demonstrated improved adherence and 53% demonstrated improved health outcomes. All the promising interventions included a behavioral component and most were 3 to 6 months in length, delivered through a digital stand-alone medium (eg, automated personalized texts, mobile health apps, and website), and assessed adherence to controller medication. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, digital interventions aimed at improving adherence are promising and also improve health outcomes in addition to medication adherence. Although future studies using evidence-based adherence assessment and multifactorial design should be conducted, the current literature suggests that both digital stand-alone interventions and interventions combining digital technology with support from a health care team member result in improved adherence and asthma outcomes. Recommendations for digital interventions for pediatric patients with asthma with adherence concerns are provided."

RESULTS: Seven clinical studies having 649 participants were studied. The median sample size was 58 (range = 41-247) and the median age of participants was 53.2 (range = 48-69.4) years. All studies showed improvements in adherence; however, only three studies reported statically significant improvements in adherence measures. Selected studies were deemed as unclear in their risk of bias and the most common source of risk of bias among the studies was the absence of objective outcome assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile apps appear to be effective interventions to help improve medication adherence in T2DM patients compared with conventional care strategies. The features of the App to improvise medical adherence cannot be defined based on the meta-analysis because of heterogeneity of study designs and less number of sample size. Systematically planned studies would set up applicability of mobile apps in the clinical management of T2DM."
Evaluation of the digital diabetes prevention programme pilot: uncontrolled mixed-methods study protocol,"Murray E, Daff K, Lavida A, Henley W, Irwin J, Valabhji J.",BMJ Open. 2019 May 22;9(5):e025903. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025903.,Murray E,BMJ Open,2019,2019/05/25,PMC6538049,,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025903,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rising steeply. National Health Service England (NHSE) is exploring the potential of a digital diabetes prevention programme (DDPP) and has commissioned a pilot with embedded evaluation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study aims to determine whether, and if so, how, should NHSE implement a national DDPP, using a mixed-methods pretest and post-test design, underpinned by two theoretical frameworks: the Coventry, Aberdeen and London - Refined (CALO-RE) taxonomy of behavioural change techniques for the digital interventions and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) for implementation processes. In eight pilot areas across England, adults with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia (NDH) (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 42-47 mmol/mol or fasting plasma glucose 5.5-6.9 mmol/L) and adults without NDH who are overweight (body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) will be referred to one of five digitally delivered diabetes prevention interventions. The primary outcomes are reduction in HbA1c and weight (for people with NDH) and reduction in weight (for people who are overweight or obese) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include use of the intervention, satisfaction, physical activity, patient activation and resources needed for successful implementation. Quantitative data will be collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months by the digital intervention providers. Qualitative data will be collected through semistructured interviews with commissioners, providers, healthcare professionals and patients. Quantitative data will be analysed descriptively and using generalised linear models to determine whether changes in outcomes are associated with demographic and intervention factors. Qualitative data will be analysed using framework analysis, with data pertaining to implementation mapped onto the CFIR. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethical approval from the Public Health England Ethics and Research Governance Group (reference R&D 324). Dissemination will include a report to NHSE to inform future policy and publication in peer-reviewed journals."
The Cost-Effectiveness of Mobile Health (mHealth) Interventions for Older Adults: Systematic Review,"Ghani Z, Jarl J, Sanmartin Berglund J, Andersson M, Anderberg P.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Jul 22;17(15):5290. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17155290.,Ghani Z,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020,2020/07/26,PMC7432315,,10.3390/ijerph17155290,"The objective of this study was to critically assess and review empirical evidence on the cost-effectiveness of Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions for older adults. We systematically searched databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Literature (CINAHL) for peer-reviewed economic evaluations published in English from 2007 to 2018. We extracted data on methods and empirical evidence (costs, effects, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) and assessed if this evidence supported the reported findings in terms of cost-effectiveness. The consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (CHEERS) checklist was used to assess the reporting quality of the included studies. Eleven studies were identified and categorized into two groups: complex smartphone communication and simple text-based communication. Substantial heterogeneity among the studies in terms of methodological approaches and types of intervention was observed. The cost-effectiveness of complex smartphone communication interventions cannot be judged due to lack of information. Limited evidence of cost-effectiveness was found for interventions related to simple text-based communications. Comprehensive economic evaluation studies are warranted to assess the cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions designed for older adults."
Mobile Phone Apps to Promote Weight Loss and Increase Physical Activity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Flores Mateo G, Granado-Font E, Ferré-Grau C, Montaña-Carreras X.",J Med Internet Res. 2015 Nov 10;17(11):e253. doi: 10.2196/jmir.4836.,Flores Mateo G,J Med Internet Res,2015,2015/11/12,PMC4704965,,10.2196/jmir.4836,"BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no meta-analysis to date has assessed the efficacy of mobile phone apps to promote weight loss and increase physical activity. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to compare the efficacy of mobile phone apps compared with other approaches to promote weight loss and increase physical activity. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies identified by a search of PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus from their inception through to August 2015. Two members of the study team (EG-F, GF-M) independently screened studies for inclusion criteria and extracted data. We included all controlled studies that assessed a mobile phone app intervention with weight-related health measures (ie, body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference) or physical activity outcomes. Net change estimates comparing the intervention group with the control group were pooled across studies using random-effects models. RESULTS: We included 12 articles in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, use of a mobile phone app was associated with significant changes in body weight (kg) and body mass index (kg/m(2)) of -1.04 kg (95% CI -1.75 to -0.34; I2 = 41%) and -0.43 kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.74 to -0.13; I2 = 50%), respectively. Moreover, a nonsignificant difference in physical activity was observed between the two groups (standardized mean difference 0.40, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.87; I2 = 93%). These findings were remarkably robust in the sensitivity analysis. No publication bias was shown. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this study shows that mobile phone app-based interventions may be useful tools for weight loss."

In this regard, mHealth technologies could potentially improve perioperative care. Based on these considerations, the objective of this scoping review is to evaluate the current status and use of mHealth interventions designed to provide perioperative care in orthopedic surgery. (2) Methods: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement (Extension for Scoping Review) and follows the framework of Arskey and O'Malley. (3) Results: The use of mHealth in the surgical setting is mainly oriented towards the development of applications for monitoring post-operative pain and optimizing communication between the various health professionals involved in patient care. (4) Conclusions: The mHealth systems can have a positive impact both on patient participation in the therapeutic process and on the communication between health professionals, increasing the quality of care."
A randomized controlled trial of an mHealth intervention for increasing access to HIV testing and care among young cisgender men and transgender women: the mLab App study protocol,"Wood OR, Garofalo R, Kuhns LM, Scherr TF, Zetina APM, Rodriguez RG, Nash N, Cervantes M, Schnall R.",BMC Public Health. 2021 Oct 29;21(1):1959. doi: 10.1186/s12889-021-12015-w.,Wood OR,BMC Public Health,2021,2021/10/30,PMC8554516,,10.1186/s12889-021-12015-w,"BACKGROUND: The number of youth living with HIV in the United States (US) continues to rise, and racial, ethnic, and sexual minority youth including young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and young transgender women (YTGW) bear a disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic. Due to social and healthcare system factors, many YMSM and YTGW do not seek HIV testing services and are therefore less likely to be aware that they are infected. Mobile health technology (mHealth) has the ability to increase uptake of HIV testing among these populations. Thus, the mLab App-which combines HIV prevention information with a mobile phone imaging feature for interpreting at-home HIV test results-was developed to improve testing rates and linkage to care among Black, Latino, and other YMSM and YTGW living in New York City and Chicago and their surrounding areas. METHODS: This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial among YMSM and YTGW aged 18-29 years. Participants are randomized to either the mLab App intervention including HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care, standard of preventive care only, or HIV home test kits and standard of preventive care only. DISCUSSION: mHealth technology used for HIV prevention is capable of delivering interventions in real-time, which creates an opportunity to remotely reach users across the country to strengthen their HIV care continuum engagement and treatment outcomes. Specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic, mHealth technology combined with at-home testing may prove to be essential in increasing HIV testing rates, especially among populations at high-risk or without regular access to HIV testing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03803683 ) on January 14, 2019."
Effectiveness of mHealth Apps for Maternal Health Care Delivery: Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews,"Ameyaw EK, Amoah PA, Ezezika O.",J Med Internet Res. 2024 May 29;26:e49510. doi: 10.2196/49510.,Ameyaw EK,J Med Internet Res,2024,2024/05/29,PMC11170050,,10.2196/49510,"BACKGROUND: Globally, the use of mobile health (mHealth) apps or interventions has increased. Robust synthesis of existing systematic reviews on mHealth apps may offer useful insights to guide maternal health clinicians and policy makers. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness or impact of mHealth apps on maternal health care delivery globally. METHODS: We systematically searched Scopus, Web of Science (Core Collection), MEDLINE or PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using a predeveloped search strategy. The quality of the reviews was independently assessed by 3 reviewers, while study selection was done by 2 independent raters. We presented a narrative synthesis of the findings, highlighting the specific mHealth apps, where they are implemented, and their effectiveness or outcomes toward various maternal conditions. RESULTS: A total of 2527 documents were retrieved, out of which 16 documents were included in the review. Most mHealth apps were implemented by sending SMS text messages with mobile phones. mHealth interventions were most effective in 5 areas: maternal anxiety and depression, diabetes in pregnancy, gestational weight management, maternal health care use, behavioral modification toward smoking cessation, and controlling substance use during pregnancy. We noted that mHealth interventions for maternal health care are skewed toward high-income countries (13/16, 81%). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of mHealth apps for maternity health care has drawn attention in research and practice recently. The study showed that research on mHealth apps and their use dominate in high-income countries. As a result, it is imperative that low- and middle-income countries intensify their commitment to these apps for maternal health care, in terms of use and research.

Strategies to Improve Adherence to Skin Self-examination and Other Self-management Practices in People at High Risk of Melanoma: A Scoping Review of Randomized Clinical Trials,"Ackermann DM, Bracken K, Janda M, Turner RM, Hersch JK, Drabarek D, Bell KJL.",JAMA Dermatol. 2023 Apr 1;159(4):432-440. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2022.6478.,Ackermann DM,JAMA Dermatol,2023,2023/03/01,,,10.1001/jamadermatol.2022.6478,"IMPORTANCE: Adherence, both in research trials and in clinical practice, is crucial to the success of interventions. There is limited guidance on strategies to increase adherence and the measurement and reporting of adherence in trials of melanoma self-management practices. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to describe (1) strategies to improve adherence to self-management practices in randomized clinical trials of people at high risk of melanoma and (2) measurement and reporting of adherence data in these trials. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Four databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL, were searched from inception to July 2022. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials of self-monitoring interventions for early detection of melanoma in people at increased risk due to personal history (eg, melanoma, transplant, dysplastic naevus syndrome), family history of melanoma, or as determined by a risk assessment tool or clinical judgment. FINDINGS: From 939 records screened, 18 eligible randomized clinical trials were identified, ranging in size from 40 to 724 participants, using a range of adherence strategies but with sparse evidence on effectiveness of the strategies. Strategies were classified as trial design (n = 15); social and economic support (n = 5); intervention design (n = 18); intervention and condition support (n = 10); and participant support (n = 18). No strategies were reported for supporting underserved groups (eg, people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, have low health literacy, non-English speakers, or older adults) to adhere to self-monitoring practices, and few trials targeted provider (referring to both clinicians and researchers) adherence (n = 5). Behavioral support tools included reminders (n = 8), priority-setting guidance (n = 5), and clinician feedback (n = 5). Measurement of adherence was usually by participant report of skin self-examination practice with some recent trials of digital interventions also directly measuring adherence to the intervention through website or application analytic data. Reporting of adherence data was limited, and fewer than half of all reports mentioned adherence in their discussion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using an adaptation of the World Health Organization framework for clinical adherence, this scoping review of randomized clinical trials identified key concepts as well as gaps in the way adherence is approached in design, conduct, and reporting of trials for skin self-examination and other self-management practices in people at high risk of melanoma. These findings may usefully guide future trials and clinical practice; evaluation of adherence strategies may be possible using a Study Within A Trial (SWAT) framework within host trials."
Effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for promoting healthy eating in adults: A systematic review,"McCarroll R, Eyles H, Ni Mhurchu C.",Prev Med. 2017 Dec;105:156-168. doi: 10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.08.022. Epub 2017 Sep 4.,McCarroll R,Prev Med,2017,2017/09/09,,,10.1016/j.ypmed.2017.08.022,"Unhealthy eating is a major risk factor for chronic disease. However, many current strategies to promote healthy eating are not sustainable over the longer-term. More cost-effective wide-reaching initiatives are urgently needed. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, delivered via mobile devices, could provide a solution. This systematic review summarized the evidence on the effect of mHealth interventions for promoting healthy eating in adults. A comprehensive systematic search of five scientific databases was conducted using methods adapted from the Cochrane Handbook. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published up to 1 July 2016, which examined healthy eating interventions delivered via mobile device. Of 879 articles identified, 84 full text articles were potentially eligible and further assessed, and 23 included. Narrative review results indicated small positive effects of mHealth interventions on healthy eating (5/8 trials) and weight loss (5/13 trials). However, the current evidence base is insufficient (studies are of poor quality) to determine conclusive positive effects. More rigorous RCTs with longer-term (>6months) follow-up are warranted to determine if effects are maintained."
How Is Quality of mHealth Interventions for Cancer Survivors Defined and Described? An Umbrella Review,"Tune T, Goh S, Williams PAH, Koczwara B.",JCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2022 May;6:e2100203. doi: 10.1200/CCI.21.00203.,Tune T,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,2022,2022/05/27,PMC9225666,,10.1200/CCI.21.00203,"PURPOSE: Although there are commonly accepted criteria of what defines quality of health care including cancer care, less is known about what defines quality of mHealth interventions in health care. The aim of this review was to identify how quality of mHealth interventions for cancer survivors is described and measured. METHODS: CINAHL, EmCare, JBI, Medline, SCOPUS, and ProQuest databases from January 2008 to January 2020 were searched. Review papers with search terms related to mobile devices, quality, and cancer relevant to adults with cancer were included. Interventions needed to consist of mHealth technologies, such as mobile applications or short message service, or wearable devices. Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Reviews were evaluated for coverage of quality according to six metrics defined by the Institute of Medicine: patient-centeredness, equitability, safety, effectiveness, timeliness, and efficiency. Any additional quality items were recorded. A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used to rate the quality of the reviews included. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 766 papers with seven systematic reviews meeting the eligibility criteria. Four papers were of AMSTAR moderate quality, with three of low quality. The median number of quality metrics reported in a review was two (the range was 1-4). Efficacy and safety and timeliness and efficiency were most reported (n = 4), followed by usability (n = 3), equitability and access (n = 2), privacy and security (n = 2), and patient-centeredness (n = 2). CONCLUSION: There is great variability in how quality of mHealth interventions is defined with no reviews addressing all quality metrics. A comprehensive approach to measure quality of mHealth interventions is needed."

Many digital health applications for pwMS have been developed. OBJECTIVES: Analysis of the evidence of digital health applications to improve health outcomes from a patient perspective. METHODS: A systematic review was performed on all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have studied mobile health interventions for pwMS, that is, which can be applied with a smartphone, tablet, or laptop to improve patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1127 articles identified in the literature search, 13 RCTs fit the inclusion criteria. Two trials studied messaging systems, two depression interventions, one addressed MS fatigue, five cognition, and three mobility issues, of which two focused on spasticity management. One trial aimed to enhance physical activity. Most were pilot studies that cannot yield definitive conclusions regarding efficacy. One depression intervention and one fatigue intervention showed significant results across several outcomes. CONCLUSION: Several mobile self-guided digital health applications for pwMS have been tested in RCTs, and two interventions targeting depression and fatigue have demonstrated significant effects. Challenges remain regarding implementation into routine care."
i-MoMCARE: Innovative Mobile Technology for Maternal and Child Health Care in Cambodia-study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Saing CH, Ung M, Suy S, Oy S, Dary C, Yam ELY, Chhorn S, Nagashima-Hayashi M, Khuon D, Mam S, Kim R, Saphonn V, Yi S.",Trials. 2023 Oct 26;24(1):692. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07724-z.,Saing CH,Trials,2023,2023/10/26,PMC10601211,,10.1186/s13063-023-07724-z,"BACKGROUND: The Government of Cambodia established the village health support groups (VHSGs) in 2003 to facilitate primary healthcare activities, including maternal and child health (MCH) services. However, VHSGs face several challenges that hinder them from performing optimally, including a lack of regular structured training and remuneration and limited and inconsistent support and supervision from the health centers (HCs). This implementation research aims to develop, implement, and evaluate a digital health intervention to improve the performance of VHSGs through better support and supervision and increase the MCH service coverage in rural Cambodia. METHODS: i-MoMCARE, a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, will be conducted between 2022 and 2025. Five operational districts (ODs) have been randomized to an intervention arm and the other five ODs to the control arm. The intervention will last for 24 months. Around 200 VHSGs in the intervention arm will be equipped with a mobile application as a job aid and 20 HC staff with a web interface to improve support and supervision of VHSGs. The potential beneficiaries will include pregnant women, mothers, and children under 2 years old. We will measure the outcomes at baseline and endline. The primary outcomes will consist of a composite MCH index constructed from maternal and newborn care indicators, child immunization, and treatment of under-two children. Secondary outcomes will include coverage of selected MCH services. We will conduct the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We will conduct qualitative interviews with selected beneficiaries and stakeholders to evaluate the intervention's acceptability, feasibility, and scalability. We will also conduct a cost-effective analysis using decision-analytic modeling incorporating a societal perspective that explores different time horizons, intervention effects, and when scaled up to the national level. DISCUSSION: i-MoMCARE is expected to increase MCH service access and coverage in rural Cambodia. It will contribute to advancing digital health use in primary healthcare interventions, which remains in its infancy in the country. Furthermore, the study findings will be a valuable addition to a growing body of literature on the effectiveness and feasibility of mobile health to improve coverage of MCH services in rural low- and middle-income country settings.

Mobile Apps to Improve Medication Adherence in Cardiovascular Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Al-Arkee S, Mason J, Lane DA, Fabritz L, Chua W, Haque MS, Jalal Z.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 May 25;23(5):e24190. doi: 10.2196/24190.,Al-Arkee S,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/05/25,PMC8188316,,10.2196/24190,"BACKGROUND: Adherence rates of preventative medication for cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported as 57%, and approximately 9% of all CVD events in Europe are attributable to poor medication adherence. Mobile health technologies, particularly mobile apps, have the potential to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the effects of mobile health care apps on medication adherence and health-related outcomes in patients with CVD. This study also evaluates apps' functionality and usability and the involvement of health care professionals in their use. METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE [Ovid], PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO [Ovid], Embase [Ovid], and Google Scholar) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate app-based interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in patients with CVD. RCTs published in English from inception to January 2020 were reviewed. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed for clinical outcomes and medication adherence, with meta-regression analysis used to evaluate the impact of app intervention duration on medication adherence. RESULTS: This study included 16 RCTs published within the last 6 years. In total, 12 RCTs reported medication adherence as the primary outcome, which is the most commonly self-reported adherence. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 to 12 months, and sample sizes ranged from 24 to 412. Medication adherence rates showed statistically significant improvements in 9 RCTs when compared with the control, and meta-analysis of the 6 RCTs reporting continuous data showed a significant overall effect in favor of the app intervention (mean difference 0.90, 95% CI 0.03-1.78) with a high statistical heterogeneity (I(2)=93.32%). Moreover, 9 RCTs assessed clinical outcomes and reported an improvement in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the intervention arm. Meta-analysis of these clinical outcomes from 6 RCTs favored app interventions, but none were significant. In the 7 trials evaluating app usability, all were found to be acceptable. There was a great variation in the app characteristics. A total of 10 RCTs involved health care professionals, mainly physicians and nurses, in the app-based interventions. The apps had mixed functionality: 2 used education, 7 delivered reminders, and 7 provided reminders in combination with educational support. CONCLUSIONS: Apps tended to increase medication adherence, but interventions varied widely in design, content, and delivery. Apps have an acceptable degree of usability; yet the app characteristics conferring usability and effectiveness are ill-defined. Future large-scale studies should focus on identifying the essential active components of successful apps.

In response there has been an explosion of digital interventions such as smartphone applications (""apps"") to extend care. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital depression intervention (VMood), delivered via a smartphone app. VMood is adapted from an in-person intervention that was delivered by non-specialist providers and shown to be effective in the Vietnamese context in our previous trial (2016-2019). A stepped-wedge, randomized controlled trial will be conducted across eight provinces in Vietnam. Adults aged 18 years and over will be recruited through community-based primary care centres and screened for depression using the embedded Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (primary outcome measure). Participants scoring 10-19, indicating depression caseness, will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group until the target of 336 is reached. Secondary outcome measures will examine the effect of the intervention on commonly co-occuring anxiety, quality of life and work productivity, along with use of alcohol and tobacco products. Assessments will be administered through an online survey platform (REDCap) at baseline, and at every 3 months until 3 months post-intervention. Intervention-group participants will receive VMood for a 3-month period, with online support provided by social workers. Control-group participants will receive a limited version of the app until they cross into the intervention group. Generalized Linear Mixed-effect Models for clustered measures will be used for all outcomes data. We will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside the trial to capture VMood's costs and benefits. This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a digital mental health intervention adapted from an in-person intervention. This trial will also contribute important information to the growing and promising field of digital mental health. Trail regulation. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier [NCT05783531]."

This scoping review aimed to provide an overview of methods for collecting intensive time series data in mental health research as well as basic principles, current applications, target constructs, and statistical methods for this type of data.In January 2021, the database MEDLINE was searched. Original articles were identified that (1) used active or passive data collection methods to gather intensive longitudinal data in daily life, (2) had a minimum sample size of N ⩾ 100 participants, and (3) included individuals with subclinical or clinical mental health problems.In total, 3799 original articles were identified, of which 174 met inclusion criteria. The most widely used methods were diary techniques (e.g. Experience Sampling Methodology), various types of sensors (e.g. accelerometer), and app usage data. Target constructs included affect, various symptom domains, cognitive processes, sleep, dysfunctional behaviour, physical activity, and social media use. There was strong evidence on feasibility of, and high compliance with, active and passive data collection methods in diverse clinical settings and groups. Study designs, sampling schedules, and measures varied considerably across studies, limiting the generalisability of findings.Gathering intensive longitudinal data has significant potential to advance mental health research. However, more methodological research is required to establish and meet critical quality standards in this rapidly evolving field. Advanced approaches such as digital phenotyping, ecological momentary interventions, and machine-learning methods will be required to efficiently use intensive longitudinal data and deliver personalised digital interventions and services for improving public mental health."

OBJECTIVE: To provide personalized estimates of short-term and long-term relative efficacy of guided and unguided iCBT for depression using patient-level information. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published up to January 1, 2019. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible RCTs were those comparing guided or unguided iCBT against each other or against any control intervention in individuals with depression. Available individual patient data (IPD) was collected from all eligible studies. Depression symptom severity was assessed after treatment, 6 months, and 12 months after randomization. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We conducted a systematic review and IPD network meta-analysis and estimated relative treatment effect sizes across different patient characteristics through IPD network meta-regression. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores. RESULTS: Of 42 eligible RCTs, 39 studies comprising 9751 participants with depression contributed IPD to the IPD network meta-analysis, of which 8107 IPD were synthesized. Overall, both guided and unguided iCBT were associated with more effectiveness as measured by PHQ-9 scores than control treatments over the short term and the long term. Guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT (mean difference [MD] in posttreatment PHQ-9 scores, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.2), but we found no evidence of a difference at 6 or 12 months following randomization. Baseline depression was found to be the most important modifier of the relative association for efficacy of guided vs unguided iCBT. Differences between unguided and guided iCBT in people with baseline symptoms of subthreshold depression (PHQ-9 scores 5-9) were small, while guided iCBT was associated with overall better outcomes in patients with baseline PHQ-9 greater than 9. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this network meta-analysis with IPD, guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT for individuals with depression, benefits were more substantial in individuals with moderate to severe depression. Unguided iCBT was associated with similar effectiveness among individuals with symptoms of mild/subthreshold depression. Personalized treatment selection is entirely possible and necessary to ensure the best allocation of treatment resources for depression."

The final sample resulted in 23 articles published between 2012 and 2020. Reviewed interventions focused on conditions such as: diabetes, depression, substance abuse, obesity, hypertension, maternal health, and farmworker safety. About one-third of mHealth interventions included mobile applications, the rest were limited to texting programs. Text message reminders can help improve medication adherence and care access, especially when coupled with support from community health workers. Bi-directional text message interventions with feedback loops and personalized treatment options can build user agency. Additionally, multi-modal applications that combine texting with self-guided interactive content show promise for culturally tailored mHealth."
A randomized controlled trial of the dissemination of an mHealth intervention for improving health outcomes: the WiseApp for Spanish-speakers living with HIV study protocol,"Olaya F, Brin M, Caraballo PB, Halpern M, Jia H, Ramírez SO, Padilla JJ, Stonbraker S, Schnall R.",BMC Public Health. 2024 Jan 17;24(1):201. doi: 10.1186/s12889-023-17538-y.,Olaya F,BMC Public Health,2024,2024/01/17,PMC10792787,,10.1186/s12889-023-17538-y,"BACKGROUND: While there is no cure for HIV, adherence to antiretroviral therapy can extend the lifespan and improve the quality of life of people with HIV. Despite the global reduction of HIV infection rates in recent years, New York City and La Romana, Dominican Republic, continue to report high infection rates among Latino populations. Many people with HIV remain virally unsuppressed in these geographic hotspots, suggesting a need for additional interventions to overcome medication adherence barriers. Tailored and culturally appropriate mobile health (mHealth) technology can be an engaging way to improve adherence. The primary objective of this trial is to test the effectiveness of an mHealth tool to improve HIV medication adherence among Spanish-speaking people living in New York City and the Dominican Republic. METHODS: The WiseApp study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial among 248 people with HIV across the New York and Dominican Republic sites over the course of 12 months. Participants are randomly assigned to either receive a CleverCap pill bottle that is linked to the WiseApp (intervention) or standard of care (control). All participants complete surveys at baseline, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up visits and the study team obtains HIV-1 viral load and CD4 count results through blood draw at each study timepoint. DISCUSSION: The use of mHealth technologies to improve medication adherence among people with HIV has been implemented in recent years. Although some studies have found improvement in adherence to antiretroviral therapy in the short term, there is limited information about how these interventions improve adherence among Spanish-speaking populations. Disproportionate rates of HIV infection among Latinos in New York City suggest an existing inequitable approach in reaching and treating this population. Due to a lack of mHealth studies with Latino populations, and apps tailored to Spanish-speakers, the WiseApp study will not only demonstrate the effectiveness of this particular mHealth app but will also contribute to the mHealth research community as a whole. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05398185) on 5/31/2022."
The Use of Mobile Technologies to Promote Physical Activity and Reduce Sedentary Behaviors in the Middle East and North Africa Region: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Tong HL, Alnasser A, Alshahrani NZ, Bawaked RA, AlAhmed R, Alsukait RF, Rakic S, Cetinkaya V, Al-Hazzaa HM, Alqahtani SA.",J Med Internet Res. 2024 Mar 19;26:e53651. doi: 10.2196/53651.,Tong HL,J Med Internet Res,2024,2024/03/19,PMC10988381,,10.2196/53651,"BACKGROUND: The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region faces unique challenges in promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviors, as the prevalence of insufficient physical activity is higher than the global average. Mobile technologies present a promising approach to delivering behavioral interventions; however, little is known about the effectiveness and user perspectives on these technologies in the MENA region. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile interventions targeting physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the MENA region and explore users' perspectives on these interventions as well as any other outcomes that might influence users' adoption and use of mobile technologies (eg, appropriateness and cultural fit). METHODS: A systematic search of 5 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Global Index Medicus) was performed. Any primary studies (participants of all ages regardless of medical condition) conducted in the MENA region that investigated the use of mobile technologies and reported any measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, or user perceptions were included. We conducted a narrative synthesis of all studies and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the quality of the included RCTs; quality assessment of the rest of the included studies was completed using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: In total, 27 articles describing 22 interventions (n=10, 37% RCTs) and 4 (15%) nonexperimental studies were included (n=6141, 46% women). Half (11/22, 50%) of the interventions included mobile apps, whereas the other half examined SMS. The main app functions were goal setting and self-monitoring of activity, whereas SMS interventions were primarily used to deliver educational content. Users in experimental studies described several benefits of the interventions (eg, gaining knowledge and receiving reminders to be active). Engagement with the interventions was poorly reported; few studies (8/27, 30%) examined users' perspectives on the appropriateness or cultural fit of the interventions. Nonexperimental studies examined users' perspectives on mobile apps and fitness trackers, reporting several barriers to their use, such as perceived lack of usefulness, loss of interest, and technical issues. The meta-analysis of RCTs showed a positive effect of mobile interventions on physical activity outcomes (standardized mean difference=0.45, 95% CI 0.17-0.73); several sensitivity analyses showed similar results. The trim-and-fill method showed possible publication bias. Only 20% (2/10) of the RCTs measured sedentary behaviors; both reported positive changes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mobile interventions for physical activity and sedentary behaviors in the MENA region is in its early stages, with preliminary evidence of effectiveness. Policy makers and researchers should invest in high-quality studies to evaluate long-term effectiveness, intervention engagement, and implementation outcomes, which can inform the design of culturally and socially appropriate interventions for countries in the MENA region.

This paper presents the study protocol of the evaluation of the application (e-intervention Tabac Info Service (e-TIS)). The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of e-TIS. The secondary objectives are to (1) describe efficacy variations with regard to users' characteristics, (2) analyse mechanisms and contextual conditions of e-TIS efficacy. METHODS AND ANALYSES: The study design is a two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial including a process evaluation with at least 3000 participants randomised to the intervention or to the control arm (current practices). Inclusion criteria are: aged 18 years or over, current smoker, having completed the online consent forms, possessing a mobile phone with android or apple systems and using mobile applications, wanting to stop smoking sooner or later. The primary outcome is the point prevalence abstinence of 7 days at 6 months later. Data will be analysed in intention to treat (primary) and per protocol analyses. A logistic regression will be carried out to estimate an OR (95% CI) for efficacy. A multivariate multilevel analysis will explore the influence on results of patients' characteristics (sex, age, education and socioprofessional levels, dependency, motivation, quit experiences) and contextual factors, conditions of use, behaviour change techniques. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was reviewed by the ethical and deontological institutional review board of the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance on 18 April 2016. The findings of this study will allow us to characterise the efficacy of e-TIS and conditions of its efficacy. These findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed articles.

Reducing craving and lapse risk in alcohol and stimulants dependence using mobile app involving ecological momentary assessment and self-guided psychological interventions: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Obarska K, Binkowska AA, Marcowski P, Szymczak K, Lewczuk K, Sollich K, Banaszak M, Woronowicz B, Nowicka M, Skorko M, Gola M.",Front Psychiatry. 2022 Dec 14;13:1011585. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1011585. eCollection 2022.,Obarska K,Front Psychiatry,2022,2023/01/02,PMC9795071,,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1011585,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of alcohol consumption in Poland is estimated to be as high as 80% of the adult population. The use of stimulants is the second most common reason for seeking addiction treatment. However, treatment outcomes remain unsatisfactory, as 40-85% of individuals who complete various treatment programs relapse and fall back into addiction within 2 years following program completion. METHODS: The 13-armed randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of a mobile app-based self-guided psychological intervention delivered via a smartphone app (Nalogometr) in reducing craving and lapse risk in problematic alcohol or stimulants use. Participant recruitment and data collection will be performed from June 2022 to September 2022. The 4-week mobile intervention program will include short-term and long-term intervention modules based mainly on mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Intervention effectiveness assessment will include Ecological Momentary Assessment. That is, we will collect longitudinal data on a set of characteristics of day-to-day functioning. The primary outcomes will include a self-reported number of lapses and addiction craving level. In contrast, the secondary outcomes will be the severity of problematic substance use, anxiety and depression scores, and life satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION: This study will establish how mobile app-based self-guided psychological interventions can help reduce craving and lapse risk in alcohol and stimulant dependence. If successful, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) may provide an innovative, easily available, and cost-effective mHealth approach for craving and lapse risk in substance addictions.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature evaluating the effectiveness of mHealth technologies supporting colonoscopy preparation on patient and clinical outcomes. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth technologies for colonoscopy preparation on patient and clinical outcomes. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and appraised methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Data were pooled using random effects models and when heterogeneity, assessed using I2, was statistically significant, a qualitative synthesis of the data was performed. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot. RESULTS: Ten RCTs (3,383 participants) met inclusion criteria. MHealth interventions included smartphone apps, SMS text messages, videos, camera apps, and a social media app. Outcomes were bowel cleanliness quality, user satisfaction, colonoscopy quality indicators (cecal intubation time, withdrawal time, adenoma detection rate), adherence to diet, and cancellation/no-show rates. MHealth interventions were associated with better bowel cleanliness scores on the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.57, 95%CI 0.37-0.77, I2 = 60%, p = 0.08] and the Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale [SMD -0.39, 95%CI -0.59-0.19, I2 = 45%, p = 0.16], but they were not associated with rates of willingness to repeat the colonoscopy using the same regimen [odds ratio (OR) 1.88, 95%CI 0.85-4.15, I2 = 48%, p = 0.12] or cancellations/no-shows [OR 0.96, 95%CI 0.68-1.35, I2 = 0%]. Most studies showed that adequate bowel preparation, user satisfaction and adherence to diet were better in the intervention groups compared to the control groups, while inconsistent findings were observed for the colonoscopy quality indicators. All trials were at high risk of bias for lack of participant blinding. Visual inspection of a funnel plot revealed publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: MHealth technologies show promise as a way to improve bowel cleanliness, but trials to date were of low methodological quality. High-quality research is required to understand the effectiveness of mHealth technologies on colonoscopy outcomes."
Application of Mobile Health Technologies Aimed at Salt Reduction: Systematic Review,"Ali SH, Luo R, Li Y, Liu X, Tang C, Zhang P.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Apr 17;7(4):e13250. doi: 10.2196/13250.,Ali SH,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/04/18,PMC6492062,,10.2196/13250,"BACKGROUND: High salt consumption has contributed to the rise of noncommunicable diseases around the world. The application of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has witnessed rapid growth in recent years. However, evidence to support mHealth interventions to confront the challenge of salt reduction has not yet been critically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify, characterize, and evaluate mHealth interventions aimed at salt reduction across the world. METHODS: A systematic search of studies in English or Chinese language published from January 1, 1992 to July 31, 2017 was conducted using 4 English databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Global Health, and Cochrane) and 3 Chinese databases (Wanfang, China Science and Technology Journal, and China National Knowledge of Infrastructure). All studies directly using mobile technologies in health care with a primary or secondary objective of reducing dietary salt consumption were included. RESULTS: A total of 1609 articles were found using the search strategy, with 11 full articles (8 English and 3 Chinese) being included for data extraction, including 11 interventional studies. Overall, few high-quality interventions were identified. Most interventions were limited by small study population sample sizes, lack of control groups, and short follow-up times, all of which were obstacles in generating long-term scalable approaches. Most interventions employed short message service as a platform for mHealth interventions, whereas some innovative mHealth technologies were also explored. Most interventions had a primary focus of improving awareness of dietary salt consumption. The outcome variables used to measure intervention effectiveness included 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, spot urine sampling, dietary records, and indirect behavior or knowledge indicators targeting salt consumption. Although most interventions displayed positive outcome results, none of them provided reliable evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of salt reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Salt reduction in mHealth initiatives remains relatively unexplored; however, studies that did intervene on salt-reduction show the potential of mHealth as an effective intervention method. We provide 3 recommendations for future mHealth interventions in salt reduction-(1) increased use of new, innovative, and interactive mHealth technologies; (2) development of mHealth interventions with primary prevention measures and goals of salt reduction; and (3) large-scale, rigorously designed, and object-targeted clinical trials of mHealth interventions with appropriate quantitative outcome variables, in particular 24-hour urine sodium."
An evidence-based gamified mHealth intervention for overweight young adults with maladaptive eating habits: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Podina IR, Fodor LA, Cosmoiu A, Boian R.",Trials. 2017 Dec 12;18(1):592. doi: 10.1186/s13063-017-2340-6.,Podina IR,Trials,2017,2017/12/14,PMC5727945,,10.1186/s13063-017-2340-6,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the first-line of treatment for overweight and obesity patients whose problems originate in maladaptive eating habits (e.g., emotional eating). However, in-person CBT is currently difficult to access by large segments of the population. The proposed SIGMA intervention (i.e., the Self-help, Integrated, and Gamified Mobile-phone Application) is a mHealth intervention based on CBT principles. It specifically targets overweight young adults with underlying maladaptive behaviors and cognitions regarding food. The SIGMA app was designed as a serious game and intended to work as a standalone app for weight maintenance or alongside a calorie-restrictive diet for weight loss. It uses a complex and novel scoring system that allows points earned within the game to be supplemented by points earned during outdoor activities with the help of an embedded pedometer. METHODS/DESIGN: The efficacy of the SIGMA mHealth intervention will be investigated within a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The intervention will be set to last 2 months with a 3-month follow-up. Selected participants will be young overweight adults with non-clinical maladaptive eating habits embodied by food cravings, binge eating, and emotional eating. The primary outcomes will be represented by changes in (1) self-reported maladaptive thoughts related to eating and body weight, (2) self-reported maladaptive eating behaviors in the range of urgent food cravings, emotional eating or binge eating, (3) as well as biased attentional processing of food items as indexed by reaction times. Secondary outcomes will be represented by changes in weight, Body Mass Index, general mood, and physical activity as indexed by the number of steps per day. DISCUSSION: Through an evidence-based cognitive behavioral approach and a user-friendly game interface, the SIGMA intervention offers a significant contribution to the development of a cost-effective and preventive self-help tool for young overweight adults with maladaptive eating habits.

Protect MSM from HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases by providing mobile health services of partner notification: protocol for a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial,"Yan X, Li Y, Su H, Xing Y, Zhang B, Lu Z, Jia Z.",BMC Public Health. 2020 Jul 14;20(1):1107. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-09162-x.,Yan X,BMC Public Health,2020,2020/07/16,PMC7362655,,10.1186/s12889-020-09162-x,"BACKGROUND: Recently, more and more men who have sex with men (MSM) look for casual partners through online dating platforms in China. However, most are unable to know their partners' HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) statuses, leading to the rapid increase in HIV infection among Chinese MSM. Effective partner notification is urgently needed to increase the risk awareness of MSM and prevent HIV and other STDs transmission. However, the traditional intervention mainly targets to the HIV-positive MSM and the effect is not promising. Our study aims to provide Internet-based partner notification, along with a series of health services for HIV-negative MSM to protect them from HIV and other STDs. METHODS: A pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial design is used to evaluate the effectiveness of a new intervention paradigm, which aims to reduce HIV and other STDs incidences among MSM in China. Through integrating a mobile health (mHealth) service application (app) to the current HIV and other STDs prevention and control methods, the new paradigm provides partner notification of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C statuses. A total of 6172 MSM in 16 districts of Beijing, China will be recruited and randomized to sequentially receive partner notification intervention through the app at 6-month intervals. The primary outcomes are HIV incidence and the additional cost of the intervention. The secondary outcomes include incidences of syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, disease transmission social networks, testing adherence, knowledge of HIV and STDs control, health self-responsibility awareness, changes of high risk behaviors and other related outcomes. The generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) will be used to analyze the differences of outcomes in the control period and in the intervention period. DISCUSSION: We expect that the HIV incidence will be significantly lower and the secondary outcomes will also be improved with providing health service of partner notification through mhealth intervention. The feasible and affordable public health intervention paradigm will have implications for HIV and STDs prevention and control among MSM and other key populations.

IMPlementation of A Relatives' Toolkit (IMPART study): an iterative case study to identify key factors impacting on the implementation of a web-based supported self-management intervention for relatives of people with psychosis or bipolar experiences in a National Health Service: a study protocol,"Lobban F, Appleton V, Appelbe D, Barraclough J, Bowland J, Fisher NR, Foster S, Johnson S, Lewis E, Mateus C, Mezes B, Murray E, O'Hanlon P, Pinfold V, Rycroft-Malone J, Siddle R, Smith J, Sutton CJ, Walker A, Jones SH.",Implement Sci. 2017 Dec 28;12(1):152. doi: 10.1186/s13012-017-0687-4.,Lobban F,Implement Sci,2017,2017/12/29,PMC5745602,,10.1186/s13012-017-0687-4,"BACKGROUND: Web-based interventions to support people to manage long-term health conditions are available and effective but rarely used in clinical services. The aim of this study is to identify critical factors impacting on the implementation of an online supported self-management intervention for relatives of people with recent onset psychosis or bipolar disorder into routine clinical care and to use this information to inform an implementation plan to facilitate widespread use and inform wider implementation of digital health interventions. METHODS: A multiple case study design within six early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services in England, will be used to test and refine theory-driven hypotheses about factors impacting on implementation of the Relatives' Education And Coping Toolkit (REACT). Qualitative data including behavioural observation, document analysis, and in-depth interviews collected in the first two EIP services (wave 1) and analysed using framework analysis, combined with quantitative data describing levels of use by staff and relatives and impact on relatives' distress and wellbeing, will be used to identify factors impacting on implementation. Consultation via stakeholder workshops with staff and relatives and co-facilitated by relatives in the research team will inform development of an implementation plan to address these factors, which will be evaluated and refined in the four subsequent EIP services in waves 2 and 3. Transferability of the implementation plan to non-participating services will be explored. DISCUSSION: Observation of implementation in a real world clinical setting, across carefully sampled services, in real time provides a unique opportunity to understand factors impacting on implementation likely to be generalizable to other web-based interventions, as well as informing further development of implementation theories. However, there are inherent challenges in investigating implementation without influencing the process under observation. We outline our strategies to ensure our design is transparent, flexible, and responsive to the timescales and activities happening within each service whilst also meeting the aims of the project.

The uses of smartphones and tablet devices in surgery: A systematic review of the literature,"Mobasheri MH, Johnston M, Syed UM, King D, Darzi A.",Surgery. 2015 Nov;158(5):1352-71. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2015.03.029. Epub 2015 May 9.,Mobasheri MH,Surgery,2015,2015/05/13,,,10.1016/j.surg.2015.03.029,"BACKGROUND: Smartphones and tablet devices have become ubiquitous, and their adoption in the health care arena is growing. Reviews have looked at their utilities within medical specialties. Despite the many surgical apps available currently, there has not been a comprehensive literature review evaluating uses of these platforms within surgical disciplines. We reviewed the literature systematically in this regard. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, Health Management Informatics Consortium, and PsychINFO databases were searched for empiric quantitative studies evaluating interventions based in the use of smartphone or tablet device within surgical disciplines targeted at surgeons, patients, or the wider public. RESULTS: Of the 39 studies included, 24 evaluated smartphone-based interventions and 15 looked at tablet devices, whereas 30 were app-based interventions and 9 were not. A wide range of effective and innovative utilities were identified and categorized into 8 domains; Diagnostics (n = 11), telemedicine (n = 9), operative navigation (n = 6), training (n = 5), data collection (n = 3), patient education (n = 2), behavior change (n = 2), and operative planning (n = 1). CONCLUSION: This comprehensive systematic literature review of smartphone and tablet device use in surgery demonstrates a wide range of innovative utilities in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative contexts. Although results of individual studies generally were favorable, limitations in methodologies existed in many, and although studies clearly highlight the substantial potential of smartphone and tablet devices in the surgical setting, trials of greater quality will be necessary to pave the way for their widespread adoption."
Toward Developing a Standardized Core Set of Outcome Measures in Mobile Health Interventions for Tuberculosis Management: Systematic Review,"Lee S, Lee Y, Lee S, Islam SMS, Kim SY.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Feb 19;7(2):e12385. doi: 10.2196/12385.,Lee S,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/02/20,PMC6399569,,10.2196/12385,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) management can be challenging in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) not only because of its high burden but also the prolonged treatment period involving multiple drugs. With rapid development in mobile technology, mobile health (mHealth) interventions or using a mobile device for TB management has gained popularity. Despite the potential usefulness of mHealth interventions for TB, few studies have quantitatively synthesized evidence on its effectiveness, presumably because of variability in outcome measures reported in the literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the outcome measures reported in TB mHealth literature in LMICs. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched to identify mHealth intervention studies for TB (published up to May 2018) that reported any type of outcome measures. The extracted information included the study setting, types of mHealth technology used, target population, study design, and categories of outcome measures. Outcomes were classified into 13 categories including treatment outcome, adherence, process measure, perception, technical outcome, and so on. The qualitative synthesis of evidence focused on the categories of outcome measures reported by the type of mHealth interventions. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included for the qualitative synthesis of evidence. The study designs varied widely, ranging from randomized controlled trials to economic evaluations. A total of 12 studies adopted short message service (SMS), whereas 5 studies used SMS in combination with additional technologies or mobile apps. The study populations were also diverse, including patients with TB, patients with TB/HIV, health care workers, and general patients attending a clinic. There was a wide range of variations in the definition of outcome measures across the studies. Among the diverse categories of outcome measures, treatment outcomes have been reported in 14 studies, but only 6 of them measured the outcome according to the standard TB treatment definitions by the World Health Organization. CONCLUSIONS: This critical evaluation of outcomes reported in mHealth studies for TB management suggests that substantial variability exists in reporting outcome measures. To overcome the challenges in evidence synthesis for mHealth interventions, this study can provide insights into the development of a core set of outcome measures by intervention type and study design."
"Protocol for the Let's Grow randomised controlled trial: examining efficacy, cost-effectiveness and scalability of a m-Health intervention for movement behaviours in toddlers","Hesketh KD, Downing KL, Galland BC, Nicholson JM, Taylor R, Orellana L, Abdelrazek M, Koorts H, Brown V, Haines J, Campbell KJ, Barnett LM, Löf M, Moodie M, Carson V, Salmon J.",BMJ Open. 2022 Mar 28;12(3):e057521. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057521.,Hesketh KD,BMJ Open,2022,2022/03/30,PMC8961153,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057521,"INTRODUCTION: Despite being an important period for the development of movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep), few interventions commencing prior to preschool have been trialled. The primary aim of this trial is to assess the 12-month efficacy of the Let's Grow mHealth intervention, designed to improve the composition of movement behaviours in children from 2 years of age. Let's Grow is novel in considering composition of movement behaviours as the primary outcome, using non-linear dynamical approaches for intervention delivery, and incorporating planning for real-world implementation and scale-up from its inception. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised controlled trial will test the effects of the 12-month parental support mHealth intervention, Let's Grow, compared with a control group that will receive usual care plus electronic newsletters on unrelated topics for cohort retention. Let's Grow will be delivered via a purpose-designed mobile web application with linked SMS notifications. Intervention content includes general and movement-behaviour specific parenting advice and incorporates established behaviour change techniques. Intervention adherence will be monitored by app usage data. Data will be collected from participants using 24-hour monitoring of movement behaviours and parent report at baseline (T(0)), mid-intervention (T(1); 6 months post baseline), at intervention conclusion (T(2); 12 months post baseline) and 1-year post intervention (T(3); 2 years post baseline). The trial aims to recruit 1100 families from across Australia during 2021. In addition to assessment of efficacy, an economic evaluation and prospective scalability evaluation will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Deakin University Human Ethics Committee (2020-077). Study findings will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentation at scientific and professional conferences, and via social and traditional media.

An Ecological Monitoring and Management App (EMMA) for Older Adults With Chronic Pain: Protocol for a Design and Feasibility Study,"Ledermann K, Abou Khaled O, Caon M, Berger T, Chabwine JN, Wicht J, Martin-Soelch C.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Aug 26;10(8):e26930. doi: 10.2196/26930.,Ledermann K,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/08/26,PMC8430865,,10.2196/26930,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a complex problem for many older adults that affects both physical functioning and psychological well-being. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have shown promise in supporting older persons in managing chronic conditions. Cognitive behavior therapy is recommended for older people with chronic pain. However, web-based treatment programs for chronic pain are not aimed at the needs of older people and offer standard therapies without providing tailored treatment for this population. OBJECTIVE: To address this problem, we aim to develop a psychological web-based intervention for ecological monitoring of daily life experiences with chronic pain called EMMA to support self-management of chronic pain in older adults. METHODS: The key clinical and engagement features of the intervention were established through the integration of evidence-based material from cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of chronic pain in older adults. The development process uses a co-design approach and actively involves end-users in the design process by incorporating feedback from focus groups with older adults in order to inform a user-centered intervention design. For the co-design process, we will include 10 older adults with chronic pain, who will discuss the requirements for the app in workshops in order to ensure suitability of the app for older adults with chronic pain. In order to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, we will include a sample of 30 older adults with chronic pain who will test all features of the intervention for a period of 8 consecutive weeks. After the trial period, validated instruments will be used to assess usability and acceptability, as well as influence on pain levels and associated physical and psychological symptoms. Participants will be invited to take part in a semistructured telephone interviews after the trial period to explore their experiences using the app. RESULTS: Digitalization of the pain diary and psychotherapeutic content has started. Recruitment of participants for the co-design workshops will start as soon as we have a functioning prototype of the electronic pain diary and EMMA intervention, which is expected to be in September 2021. The feasibility study will start as soon as the co-design process is finished and required changes have been implemented into the pain diary and the EMMA intervention. We expect to start the feasibility study early in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Required changes to assure usability and acceptability will be directly implemented in the app. EMMA brings together a strong body of evidence using cognitive behavioral and self-management theory with contemporary mHealth principles, allowing for a cost-effective intervention that can be used to target chronic pain anywhere and anytime by older adults. Given the ubiquity of mHealth interventions for chronic conditions, the results of this study may serve to inform the development of tailored self-management interventions.

Evaluation of the nurse-assisted eHealth intervention 'eHealth@Hospital-2-Home' on self-care by patients with heart failure and colorectal cancer post-hospital discharge: protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Storm M, Morken IM, Austin RC, Nordfonn O, Wathne HB, Urstad KH, Karlsen B, Dalen I, Gjeilo KH, Richardson A, Elwyn G, Bru E, Søreide JA, Kørner H, Mo R, Strömberg A, Lurås H, Husebø AML.",BMC Health Serv Res. 2024 Jan 4;24(1):18. doi: 10.1186/s12913-023-10508-5.,Storm M,BMC Health Serv Res,2024,2024/01/04,PMC10768157,,10.1186/s12913-023-10508-5,"BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are prone to comorbidity, a high rate of readmission, and complex healthcare needs. Self-care for people with HF and CRC after hospitalisation can be challenging, and patients may leave the hospital unprepared to self-manage their disease at home. eHealth solutions may be a beneficial tool to engage patients in self-care. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial with an embedded evaluation of intervention engagement and cost-effectiveness will be conducted to investigate the effect of eHealth intervention after hospital discharge on the self-efficacy of self-care. Eligible patients with HF or CRC will be recruited before discharge from two Norwegian university hospitals. The intervention group will use a nurse-assisted intervention-eHealth@Hospital-2-Home-for six weeks. The intervention includes remote monitoring of vital signs; patients' self-reports of symptoms, health and well-being; secure messaging between patients and hospital-based nurse navigators; and access to specific HF and CRC health-related information. The control group will receive routine care. Data collection will take place before the intervention (baseline), at the end of the intervention (Post-1), and at six months (Post-2). The primary outcome will be self-efficacy in self-care. The secondary outcomes will include measures of burden of treatment, health-related quality of life and 30- and 90-day readmissions. Sub-study analyses are planned in the HF patient population with primary outcomes of self-care behaviour and secondary outcomes of medication adherence, and readmission at 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. Patients' and nurse navigators' engagement and experiences with the eHealth intervention and cost-effectiveness will be investigated. Data will be analysed according to intention-to-treat principles. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. DISCUSSION: This protocol will examine the effects of the eHealth@ Hospital-2-Home intervention on self-care in two prevalent patient groups, HF and CRC. It will allow the exploration of a generic framework for an eHealth intervention after hospital discharge, which could be adapted to other patient groups, upscaled, and implemented into clinical practice.

Are digital health interventions valuable to support patients with cancer and caregivers? An umbrella review of web-based and app-based supportive care interventions,"Fournier V, Duprez C, Grynberg D, Antoine P, Lamore K.",Cancer Med. 2023 Dec;12(23):21436-21451. doi: 10.1002/cam4.6695. Epub 2023 Nov 8.,Fournier V,Cancer Med,2023,2023/11/08,PMC10726780,,10.1002/cam4.6695,"BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies have expanded tremendously in the last two decades, creating an emerging research and clinical field. They are regarded as cost-effective, and their use in healthcare is prioritized by many countries. However, the constant evolution of these technologies has led to an abundance of related literature. Thus, we conducted an umbrella review to identify and characterize digital supportive care interventions for patients with cancer and their relatives. METHODS: A preregistered umbrella review was conducted (PROSPERO registration number CRD42022333110). Five databases were searched (Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library). To be considered, studies had to be systematic reviews or meta-analyses, be performed on pediatric or adult patients with cancer or survivors or their relatives, report results on web-based or app-based supportive care interventions, and measure psychological, functional, or behavioral variables or quality of life related to cancer. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. FINDINGS: Twenty eligible studies were identified. Most of the included studies reported results from adult patients with cancer. Globally, digital interventions were shown to be effective for physical activity in patients with cancer but had mixed results regarding emotional outcomes and quality of life. Additionally, a lack of methodological quality was noted for most of the included reviews. DISCUSSION: Digital supportive care interventions could be an effective tool in cancer care for some outcomes. Recommendations have been formulated for further research in this field using adapted methodologies for the development of digital health interventions."
A community health worker and mobile health app intervention to improve adherence to HIV medication among persons with HIV: the CHAMPS study protocol,"Wood OR, Schnall R, Kay ES, Jia H, Abua JA, Nichols TK, Olender SA, Mugavero MJ, Batey DS.",BMC Public Health. 2023 May 24;23(1):942. doi: 10.1186/s12889-023-15616-9.,Wood OR,BMC Public Health,2023,2023/05/24,PMC10206576,,10.1186/s12889-023-15616-9,"BACKGROUND: Persons with HIV (PWH) can now achieve a near-normal life expectancy due to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Despite widespread availability of ART in the United States (US), many of the country's approximate 1.1 million PWH are not achieving viral suppression due to poor ART adherence. Viral suppression rates are particularly low in Alabama (AL, 62%) and New York City (NYC, 67%). There is mixed evidence on the efficacy of community health workers (CHW) and mHealth interventions for improving ART adherence and viral suppression in PWH thus, we sought to combine these interventions and test the efficacy for improving health outcomes in PWH. METHODS: The CHAMPS study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial among 300 PWH with suboptimal primary care appointment adherence (n = 150 in AL and 150 in NYC) over the course of 12 months. Participants are randomly assigned to CHAMPS (intervention) or a standard-of-care (control) arm. Participants in the intervention arm are given a CleverCap pill bottle that syncs to the WiseApp to track medication adherence, reminds users to take their medication at a set time, and enables communication with CHW. All participants complete baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up visits where surveys are administered and, CD4 and HIV-1 viral load are obtained through blood draw. DISCUSSION: Maintaining ART adherence has significant implications in HIV management and transmission. mHealth technologies have been shown to optimize the provision of health services, produce positive changes in health behavior, and significantly improve health outcomes. CHW interventions also provide personal support to PWH. The combination of these strategies may provide the necessary intensity to increase ART adherence and clinic attendance among PWH at highest risk for low engagement. Delivering care remotely enables CHW to contact, assess, and support numerous participants throughout the day, reducing burden on CHW and potentially improving intervention durability for PWH. The adoption of the WiseApp coupled with community health worker sessions in the CHAMPS study has the potential to improve HIV health outcomes, and will add to the growing knowledge of mHealth and CHW efforts to improve PWH medication adherence and viral suppression.

Prevention of dementia using mobile phone applications (PRODEMOS): protocol for an international randomised controlled trial,"Eggink E, Hafdi M, Hoevenaar-Blom MP, Song M, Andrieu S, Barnes LE, Birck C, Brooks RL, Coley N, Ford E, Georges J, van der Groep A, van Gool WA, Handels R, Hou H, Li D, Liu H, Lyu J, van Marwijk H, van der Meijden M, Niu Y, Sadhwani S, Wang W, Wang Y, Wimo A, Ye X, Yu Y, Zeng Q, Zhang W, Wang W, Brayne C, Moll van Charante EP, Richard E.",BMJ Open. 2021 Jun 9;11(6):e049762. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049762.,Eggink E,BMJ Open,2021,2021/06/10,PMC8191602,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049762,"INTRODUCTION: Profiles of high risk for future dementia are well understood and are likely to concern mostly those in low-income and middle-income countries and people at greater disadvantage in high-income countries. Approximately 30%-40% of dementia cases have been estimated to be attributed to modifiable risk factors, including hypertension, smoking and sedentary lifestyle. Tailored interventions targeting these risk factors can potentially prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Mobile health (mHealth) improves accessibility of such prevention strategies in hard-to-reach populations while at the same time tailoring such approaches. In the current study, we will investigate the effectiveness and implementation of a coach-supported mHealth intervention, targeting dementia risk factors, to reduce dementia risk. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The prevention of dementia using mobile phone applications (PRODEMOS) randomised controlled trial will follow an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, taking place in the UK and China. People are eligible if they are 55-75 years old, of low socioeconomic status (UK) or from the general population (China); have >/=2 dementia risk factors; and own a smartphone. 2400 participants will be randomised to either a coach-supported, interactive mHealth platform, facilitating self-management of dementia risk factors, or a static control platform. The intervention and follow-up period will be 18 months. The primary effectiveness outcome is change in the previously validated Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing and Incidence of Dementia dementia risk score. The main secondary outcomes include improvement of individual risk factors and cost-effectiveness. Implementation outcomes include acceptability, adoption, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The PRODEMOS trial is sponsored in the UK by the University of Cambridge and is granted ethical approval by the London-Brighton and Sussex Research Ethics Committee (reference: 20/LO/01440). In China, the trial is approved by the medical ethics committees of Capital Medical University, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Beijing Geriatric Hospital, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Taishan Medical University and Xuanwu Hospital.

Keep-on-Keep-up Nutrition (KOKU-Nut) is a free, tablet-based app that focuses on increasing physical activity and improving the dietary intake of older adults based on UK guidelines. The intervention targets an important research area identified as a research priority reported by the James Lind Alliance priority setting partnership for malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of using the digital health tool KOKU-Nut among community-dwelling older adults to inform a future randomized controlled trial. The secondary aims are to determine the acceptability, usability, preliminary effect sizes, and safety of the study and the intervention (KOKU-Nut). METHODS: This is a feasibility randomized controlled trial. We plan to recruit a total of 36 community-dwelling older adults using purposive sampling. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention or the control group. The intervention group will be asked to engage with KOKU-Nut 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants in the control group will receive a leaflet promoting a healthy lifestyle. All study participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and the end of the 12 weeks. A sample of participants will be asked to participate in an optional interview. The study will collect a range of data including anthropometry (height and weight), dietary intake (3-day food diary), physical function (grip strength and 5-times sit-to-stand), perceived quality of life (EQ-5D), usability (System Usability Scale), and safety (adverse events). RESULTS: Data collection commenced in March 2024, and the results will be ready for publication by January 2025. Feasibility will be determined on the basis of participants' self-reported engagement with the intervention, and recruitment and retention rates and will be summarized descriptively. We will also consider the amount of missing data and assess how outcomes are related to group assignment. Acceptability will be measured using the modified treatment evaluation inventory and one-to-one semistructured interviews. Transcripts from the interviews will be analyzed using NVivo (version 12; QSR International) software using framework analysis to understand any barriers to the recruitment process, the suitability of the assessment measures, and the acceptability of the intervention and study design. CONCLUSIONS: The study aligns with guidelines developed by the Medical Research Council for developing a complex intervention by using qualitative and quantitative research to examine the barriers of the intervention and identify potential challenges around recruitment and retention. We anticipate that these results will inform the development of a future powered randomized controlled design trial to test the true effectiveness of KOKU-Nut.

The development of new medical treatments is promising and important, but the basic treatment remains self-management, even if adherence to lifestyle advice is low. Electronic health (eHealth) or mHealth interventions can increase empowerment among people living with T2D and may compensate for the lack of professional resources and geographical distances. The interactive self-management support (iSMS) project aims at including digital tools to support people living with T2D in their self-management and facilitating their interaction with diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs). This protocol outlines a study with the purpose of developing and evaluating an intervention where people living with T2D can increase self-efficacy and empowerment through digital self-monitoring and interaction with DSNs. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a person-centered iSMS intervention in primary health care for people with T2D in addition to their usual diabetes care. METHODS: This study is a 12-month, 3-armed, nonblinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), which will be conducted in 6 primary health care centers (HCCs) in northern Sweden. Eligible participants will be randomized to either an intervention group (n=46), a control group (n=46), or an external group (n=46) for comparison. The intervention group will receive the mobile app, and the control group will receive a minimal intervention (diabetes brochure) and the usual standard of care. Changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) will be the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: This trial is currently open for recruitment. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in Autumn 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This study, with its focus on iSMS, will provide insights regarding suitable ways to promote and develop a person-centered intervention. If successful, the intervention has the potential to become a model for the provision of self-management support to people with T2D.

DESIGN: A multisite, parallel group, pilot randomized controlled trial (ethics approval: HREC2020.331-RMH69278). METHODS: Adult patients scheduled to undergo elective cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, or a combination of bypass grafting and valve surgery or aortic surgery) will be recruited from three metropolitan tertiary teaching hospitals. Patients allocated to the control group with receive usual care that is comprised of in-patient discharge education and local paper-based written discharge materials. Patients in the intervention group will be provided access to tailored 'GoShare' mHealth bundles preoperatively, in a week of hospital discharge and 30 days after surgery. The mHealth bundles are comprised of patient narrative videos, animations and links to reputable resources. Bundles can be accessed via a smartphone, tablet or computer. Bundles are evidence-based and designed to improve patient self-efficacy and self-management behaviours, and to empower people to have a more active role in their healthcare. Computer-generated permuted block randomization with an allocation ratio of 1:1 will be generated for each site. At the time of consent, and 30, 60 and 90 days after surgery quality of life and level of patient activation will be measured. In addition, rates of representation and readmission to hospital will be tracked and verified via data linkage 1 year after the date of surgery. DISCUSSION: Interventions using mHealth technologies have proven effectiveness for a range of cardiovascular conditions with limited testing in cardiac surgical populations. IMPACT: This study provides an opportunity to improve patient outcome and experience for adults undergoing cardiac surgery by empowering patients as end-users with strategies for self-help.

Early Intervention Services (EIS) for psychosis include face-to-face psychosocial interventions for CUD, because reducing or discontinuing cannabis use improves clinical and health care service use outcomes. However, multiple barriers (eg, staff availability and limited access to treatment) can hinder the implementation of these interventions. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may help circumvent some of these barriers; however, to date, no study has evaluated the effects of mHealth psychological interventions for CUD in individuals with FEP. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial using a novel mHealth psychological intervention (iCanChange [iCC]) to address CUD in young adults with FEP. iCC was developed based on clinical evidence showing that in individuals without psychosis, integrating the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and behavioral self-management approaches are effective in improving cannabis use-related outcomes. METHODS: Consenting individuals (n=100) meeting the inclusion criteria (eg, aged 18-35 years with FEP and CUD) will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention (iCC+modified EIS) or control (EIS) group. The iCC is fully automatized and contains 21 modules that are completed over a 12-week period and 3 booster modules available during the 3-month follow-up period. Validated self-report measures will be taken via in-person assessments at baseline and at 6, 12 (end point), and 24 weeks (end of trial); iCC use data will be collected directly from the mobile app. Primary outcomes are intervention completion and trial retention rates, and secondary outcomes are cannabis use quantity, participant satisfaction, app use, and trial recruiting parameters. Exploratory outcomes include severity of psychotic symptoms and CUD severity. For primary outcomes, we will use the chi-square test using data collected at week 12. We will consider participation in iCC acceptable if >/=50% of the participants complete at least 11 out of 21 intervention modules and the trial feasible if attrition does not reach 50%. We will use analysis of covariance and mixed-effects models for secondary outcomes and generalized estimating equation multivariable analyses for exploratory outcomes. RESULTS: Recruitment began in July 2022, and data collection is anticipated to be completed in July 2024. The main results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2024. We will engage patient partners and other stakeholders in creating a multifaceted knowledge translation plan to reach a diverse audience. CONCLUSIONS: If feasible, this study will provide essential data for a larger-scale efficacy trial of iCC on cannabis use outcomes in individuals with FEP and CUD.

The effectiveness of digital interventions for increasing physical activity in individuals of low socioeconomic status: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Western MJ, Armstrong MEG, Islam I, Morgan K, Jones UF, Kelson MJ.",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2021 Nov 9;18(1):148. doi: 10.1186/s12966-021-01218-4.,Western MJ,Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,2021,2021/11/10,PMC8576797,,10.1186/s12966-021-01218-4,"BACKGROUND: Digital technologies such as wearables, websites and mobile applications are increasingly used in interventions targeting physical activity (PA). Increasing access to such technologies makes an attractive prospect for helping individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) in becoming more active and healthier. However, little is known about their effectiveness in such populations. The aim of this systematic review was to explore whether digital interventions were effective in promoting PA in low SES populations, whether interventions are of equal benefit to higher SES individuals and whether the number or type of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used in digital PA interventions was associated with intervention effects. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was used to identify eligible studies from MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and The Cochrane Library, published between January 1990 and March 2020. Randomised controlled trials, using digital technology as the primary intervention tool, and a control group that did not receive any digital technology-based intervention were included, provided they had a measure of PA as an outcome. Lastly, studies that did not have any measure of SES were excluded from the review. Risk of Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2. RESULTS: Of the 14,589 records initially identified, 19 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Using random-effects models, in low SES there was a standardised mean difference (SMD (95%CI)) in PA between intervention and control groups of 0.06 (- 0.08,0.20). In high SES the SMD was 0.34 (0.22,0.45). Heterogeneity was modest in both low (I(2) = 0.18) and high (I(2) = 0) SES groups. The studies used a range of digital technologies and BCTs in their interventions, but the main findings were consistent across all of the sub-group analyses (digital interventions with a PA only focus, country, chronic disease, and duration of intervention) and there was no association with the number or type of BCTs. DISCUSSION: Digital interventions targeting PA do not show equivalent efficacy for people of low and high SES. For people of low SES, there is no evidence that digital PA interventions are effective, irrespective of the behaviour change techniques used. In contrast, the same interventions in high SES participants do indicate effectiveness. To reduce inequalities and improve effectiveness, future development of digital interventions aimed at improving PA must make more effort to meet the needs of low SES people within the target population."
"Feasibility, useability and acceptability of technology-based interventions for informal cancer carers: a systematic review","Heynsbergh N, Heckel L, Botti M, Livingston PM.",BMC Cancer. 2018 Mar 2;18(1):244. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4160-9.,Heynsbergh N,BMC Cancer,2018,2018/03/04,PMC5834845,,10.1186/s12885-018-4160-9,"BACKGROUND: Carers looking after someone with cancer often experience negative impacts on their own health. M-health interventions have been designed to provide information and support to patients and their carers. However, the effectiveness of technology-based interventions for carers is less well understood. The objectives were to assess the feasibility, useability and acceptability of technology-based interventions among carers of people living with cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of the CINAHL, MEDLINE and PSYCINFO databases was performed using terms related to web-based interventions and smartphone applications, carers and cancer. Studies were included if a randomised controlled trial or pilot study was conducted, focused on adult carers looking after another adult with cancer and were published between January 2007-June 2017. Articles were excluded if they reported qualitative results only or were evaluating existing websites and applications. Feasibility was measured by attrition, recruitment rates and frequency of intervention use; useability was measured by the ease of intervention use and the role of features to minimise errors in use. Acceptability was measured by carers' perception of the appropriateness of the content and their ability to incorporate the intervention into their daily routines. RESULTS: Of the 729 articles, six articles met the inclusion criteria. Attrition ranged from 14% - 77%, recruitment rates from 20% - 66% and intervention useability varied across studies. Half of the studies implemented measures to improve useability. Overall, carers rated the content of the interventions as appropriate and reported improved knowledge and communication. Acceptability was further demonstrated as carers preferred the flexibility available with web-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Technology-based interventions are suitable for use among carers of people with cancer. Further research is required to fully assess the impact of technology as an information and support mechanism for carers."
Classification of Digital Mental Health Interventions: A Rapid Review and Framework Proposal,"Gagnon MP, Sasseville M, Leblanc A.",Stud Health Technol Inform. 2022 May 25;294:629-633. doi: 10.3233/SHTI220545.,Gagnon MP,Stud Health Technol Inform,2022,2022/05/25,,,10.3233/SHTI220545,"The modern context of mental health interventions asks for an inclusion of digital solutions to the face-to-face approach, providing better access and reduced inequity for patients. The current classification of digital mental health interventions can be system specific (mobile apps) or general (virtual therapy), which causes inadequacy in applications. The goal of this study was to develop a framework to improve digital mental health interventions classification. We performed a rapid review of the literature on existing digital mental health interventions frameworks. We identified four existing frameworks, extracted their purpose, categories and items, completed a thematic analysis and formulated a four domains framework proposal. This framework allows to classify digital mental health interventions on their system, function, time and facilitation, which should facilitate our understanding of the effect of singular characteristics on patient outcomes."
Mobile Digital Health Intervention to Promote Nutrition and Physical Activity Behaviors Among Long-term Unemployed in Rural Areas: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Weishaupt I, Mages-Torluoglu J, Kunze C, Weidmann C, Steinhausen K, Bailer AC.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Nov 14;11(11):e40321. doi: 10.2196/40321.,Weishaupt I,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/11/14,PMC9706377,,10.2196/40321,"BACKGROUND: Long-term unemployed have poor nutritional and physical activity statuses, and, therefore, special health promotion needs. Particularly in rural areas, however, they often do not have access to health promotion service. Thus, new promising strategies to improve the health of long-term unemployed are needed. Hence, a digital health intervention to promote nutritional and physical health behaviors was conceived, and the effectiveness of the intervention in combination with face-to-face sessions will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to elucidate the effectiveness of a mobile digital health intervention to promote the nutritional and physical activity behaviors of long-term unemployed in the rural areas of Germany. METHODS: The 9-week intervention aims to promote nutritional or physical activity behavior by improving drinking habits, increasing the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, increasing daily step count, strengthening muscles, and improving endurance. The intervention design is based on the transtheoretical model and is implemented in a mobile app using the MobileCoach open-source platform. The effectiveness of the intervention will be elucidated by a 9-week, 2-armed, parallel-designed trial. Therefore, long-term unemployed will be recruited by employees of the German social sector institutions and randomized either to receive information brochures; the digital intervention in the form of a mobile app; and 3 face-to-face sessions regarding technical support, healthy eating, and physical activity (n=100) or to receive a control treatment consisting of solely the hand over of information brochures (n=100). The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed using questionnaires at baseline, after 9 weeks in face-to-face appointments, and after a 3-month follow-up period by postal contact. The use of the mobile app will be monitored, and qualitative interviews or focus groups with the participants will be conducted. Incentives of euro50 (US $49.7) will be paid to the participants and are tied to the completion of the questionnaires and not to the use of the mobile app or progress in the intervention. RESULTS: The effectiveness of the intervention in promoting the nutritional and physical activity behaviors of long-term unemployed participants will be elucidated. The adherence of the participants to and the acceptance and usability of the mobile device app will be evaluated. Recruitment started in March 2022, and the final publication of the results is expected in the first half of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Positive health-related changes made by the intervention would display the potency of digital health interventions to promote nutritional and physical activity behaviors among long-term unemployed in the rural areas of Germany, which would also contribute to an improved health status of the German population in general.

Measuring psychiatric symptoms online: A systematic review of the use of inventories on Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk),"Kolc KL, Tan YXK, Lo AZY, Shvetcov A, Mitchell PB, Perkes IE.",J Psychiatr Res. 2023 Jul;163:118-126. doi: 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.05.027. Epub 2023 May 2.,Kolc KL,J Psychiatr Res,2023,2023/05/20,,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.05.027,"Symptom measurement in psychiatric research increasingly uses digitized self-report inventories and is turning to crowdsourcing platforms for recruitment, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). The impact of digitizing pencil-and-paper inventories on the psychometric properties is underexplored in mental health research. Against this background, numerous studies report high prevalence estimates of psychiatric symptoms in mTurk samples. Here we develop a framework to evaluate the online implementation of psychiatric symptom inventories relative to two domains, that is, the adherence to (i) validated scoring and (ii) standardized administration. We apply this new framework to the online use of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Our systematic review of the literature identified 36 implementations of these three inventories on mTurk across 27 publications. We also evaluated methodological approaches to enhance data quality, e.g., the use of bot detection and attention check items. Of the 36 implementations, 23 reported the applied diagnostic scoring criteria and only 18 reported the specified symptom timeframe. None of the 36 implementations reported adaptations made in their digitization of the inventories. While recent reports attribute higher rates of mood, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders on mTurk to data quality, our findings indicate that this inflation may also relate to the assessment methods. We provide recommendations to enhance both data quality and fidelity to validated administration and scoring methods."
Information Needs and Communication Strategies for People with Coronary Heart Disease: A Scoping Review,"Zwack CC, Smith C, Poulsen V, Raffoul N, Redfern J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2023 Jan 17;20(3):1723. doi: 10.3390/ijerph20031723.,Zwack CC,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2023,2023/02/11,PMC9914653,,10.3390/ijerph20031723,"A critical aspect of coronary heart disease (CHD) care and secondary prevention is ensuring patients have access to evidence-based information. The purpose of this review is to summarise the guiding principles, content, context and timing of information and education that is beneficial for supporting people with CHD and potential communication strategies, including digital interventions. We conducted a scoping review involving a search of four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Medline) for articles published from January 2000 to August 2022. Literature was identified through title and abstract screening by expert reviewers. Evidence was synthesised according to the review aims. Results demonstrated that information-sharing, decision-making, goal-setting, positivity and practicality are important aspects of secondary prevention and should be patient-centred and evidenced based with consideration of patient need and preference. Initiation and duration of education is highly variable between and within people, hence communication and support should be regular and ongoing. In conclusion, text messaging programs, smartphone applications and wearable devices are examples of digital health strategies that facilitate education and support for patients with heart disease. There is no one size fits all approach that suits all patients at all stages, hence flexibility and a suite of resources and strategies is optimal."
Digital Health Technologies for Remote Monitoring and Management of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review,"Nguyen NH, Martinez I, Atreja A, Sitapati AM, Sandborn WJ, Ohno-Machado L, Singh S.",Am J Gastroenterol. 2022 Jan 1;117(1):78-97. doi: 10.14309/ajg.0000000000001545.,Nguyen NH,Am J Gastroenterol,2022,2021/11/09,PMC8987011,NIHMS1787816,10.14309/ajg.0000000000001545,"INTRODUCTION: Digital health technologies may be useful tools in the management of chronic diseases. We performed a systematic review of digital health interventions in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and evaluated its impact on (i) disease activity monitoring, (ii) treatment adherence, (iii) quality of life (QoL) measures, and/or (iv) health care utilization. METHODS: Through a systematic review of multiple databases through August 31, 2020, we identified randomized controlled trials in patients with IBD comparing digital health technologies vs standard of care (SoC) for clinical management and monitoring and reporting impact on IBD disease activity, treatment adherence, QoL, and/or health care utilization or cost-effectiveness. We performed critical qualitative synthesis of the evidence supporting digital health interventions in patients with IBD and rated certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS: Overall, we included 14 randomized controlled trials (median, 98 patients; range 34-909 patients; follow-up <12 months) that compared web-based interventions, mobile applications, and different telemedicine platforms with SoC (clinic-based encounters). Although overall disease activity and risk of relapse were comparable between digital health technologies and SoC (very low certainty of evidence), digital health interventions were associated with lower rate of health care utilization and health care costs (low certainty of evidence). Digital health interventions did not significantly improve patients' QoL and treatment adherence compared with SoC (very low certainty of evidence). Trials may have intrinsic selection bias due to nature of digital interventions. DISCUSSION: Digital health technologies may be effective in decreasing health care utilization and costs, though may not offer advantage in reducing risk of relapse, QoL, and improving treatment adherence in patients with IBD. These techniques may offer value-based care for population health management."
A self-guided Internet-based intervention for individuals with gambling problems: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Bücker L, Westermann S, Kühn S, Moritz S.",Trials. 2019 Jan 23;20(1):74. doi: 10.1186/s13063-019-3176-z.,Bücker L,Trials,2019,2019/01/25,PMC6343284,,10.1186/s13063-019-3176-z,"BACKGROUND: Only a small fraction of individuals with pathological or problematic gambling seek professional help despite available evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Anonymous Internet-based interventions may help to overcome treatment barriers. Results of a pilot study using an Internet-based intervention for depression in a sample of individuals with problematic or pathological gambling behavior show that both depressive and gambling-related symptomatology can be reduced with a generic depression program compared with a wait-list control group. Based on encouraging results of the pilot study, we developed a low-threshold, anonymous and cost-free online self-help program (""Restart"") to test whether a program tailored to the needs of gamblers yields better results compared to the effects of the intervention evaluated in the pilot study. The online self-help program is based on CBT, targeting emotional problems and gambling-related symptoms and is accompanied by a smartphone application to sustain treatment benefits. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial with two conditions (intervention group and wait-list control group), two assessment times (reassessment after 8 weeks) and a total of 136 participants is planned. The primary outcome will be change in pathological gambling measured with the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale from pre to post intervention. The change in depressive symptoms (assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 depression module) and gambling-related dysfunctional thoughts (assessed with the Gambling Attitudes and Beliefs Survey) will represent secondary outcomes. The intervention includes modules on debt management, impulse control, gambling-specific cognitive biases, self-esteem, social competence, sleep hygiene, mindfulness and positive activities. DISCUSSION: This study is one of the first investigations of Internet-based self-help programs in a sample of problematic gamblers. Self-guided Internet-based interventions represent a promising possibility to narrow the existing treatment gap while saving expensive and scarce resources (e.g., psychotherapists). The expected findings will add substantial knowledge in the development of effective Internet-based treatments for individuals with gambling problems. The empirical and clinical implications (e.g., broader use and promotion of such interventions in the future) and the limitations of the study will be discussed.

Testing the feasibility of a mobile technology intervention promoting healthy gestational weight gain in pregnant women (txt4two) - study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Willcox JC, Campbell KJ, McCarthy EA, Wilkinson SA, Lappas M, Ball K, Fjeldsoe B, Griffiths A, Whittaker R, Maddison R, Shub A, Pidd D, Fraser E, Moshonas N, Crawford DA.",Trials. 2015 May 7;16:209. doi: 10.1186/s13063-015-0730-1.,Willcox JC,Trials,2015,2015/05/08,PMC4426547,,10.1186/s13063-015-0730-1,"BACKGROUND: Overweight, obesity and excess gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with negative health outcomes for mother and child in pregnancy and across the life course. Interventions promoting GWG within guidelines report mixed results. Most are time and cost intensive, which limits scalability. Mobile technologies (mHealth) offer low cost, ready access and individually-tailored support. We aim to test the feasibility of an mHealth intervention promoting healthy nutrition, physical activity and GWG in women who begin pregnancy overweight or obese. METHODS/DESIGN: txt4two is a parallel randomised control trial pilot recruiting women with a singleton, live gestation between 10(+0) and 17(+6) weeks at the first hospital antenatal clinic visit. Inclusion criteria are pre-pregnancy BMI > 25 kg/m(2) and mobile phone ownership. One hundred consenting women will be randomised to intervention or control groups at a 1:1 ratio. All participants will receive standard antenatal care. In addition, the txt4two intervention will be delivered from baseline to 36 weeks gestation and consists of a tailored suite of theoretically-grounded, evidence-based intervention strategies focusing on healthy nutrition, physical activity and GWG. This includes: mobile phone interactive text messages promoting positive health behaviours, goal setting and self-monitoring; video messages; an information website; and a private moderated Facebook(R) chat forum. The primary outcome is the feasibility of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include GWG and participants' knowledge and behaviour regarding diet and physical activity during pregnancy. DISCUSSION: Findings will inform the development of larger-scale mHealth programmes to improve the delivery of healthy pregnancy nutrition, physical activity and GWG, that could be widely translated and disseminated.

Facilitators and barriers of mHealth interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic: systematic review,"Amiri P, Nadri H, Bahaadinbeigy K.",BMC Health Serv Res. 2023 Oct 28;23(1):1176. doi: 10.1186/s12913-023-10171-w.,Amiri P,BMC Health Serv Res,2023,2023/10/29,PMC10613392,,10.1186/s12913-023-10171-w,"BACKGROUND: With the spread of Covid-19 disease, health interventions related to the control, prevention, and treatment of this disease and other diseases were given real attention. The purpose of this systematic review is to express facilitators and barriers of using mobile health (mHealth) interventions during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this systematic review, original studies were searched using keywords in the electronic database of PubMed until August 2022. The objectives and outcomes of these studies were extracted. Finally, to identify the facilitators and barriers of mHealth interventions, a qualitative content analysis was conducted based on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis method with Atlas.ti 8 software. We evaluated the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). RESULTS: In total, 1598 articles were identified and 55 articles were included in this study. Most of the studies used mobile applications to provide and receive health services during the Covid-19 pandemic (96.4%). The purpose of the applications was to help prevention (17), follow-up (15), treatment (12), and diagnosis (8). Using SWOT analysis, 13 facilitators and 18 barriers to patients' use of mHealth services were identified. CONCLUSION: Mobile applications are very flexible technologies that can be customized for each person, patient, and population. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the applications designed due to lack of interaction, lack of time, lack of attention to privacy, and non-academic nature have not met their expectations of them."
mHealth intervention delivered in general practice to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour of patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (ENERGISED): rationale and study protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial,"Vetrovsky T, Kral N, Pfeiferova M, Kuhnova J, Novak J, Wahlich C, Jaklova A, Jurkova K, Janek M, Omcirk D, Capek V, Maes I, Steffl M, Ussher M, Tufano JJ, Elavsky S, Van Dyck D, Cimler R, Yates T, Harris T, Seifert B.",BMC Public Health. 2023 Mar 31;23(1):613. doi: 10.1186/s12889-023-15513-1.,Vetrovsky T,BMC Public Health,2023,2023/03/30,PMC10064755,,10.1186/s12889-023-15513-1,"BACKGROUND: The growing number of patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes is a major public health concern. Physical activity is a cornerstone of diabetes management and may prevent its onset in prediabetes patients. Despite this, many patients with (pre)diabetes remain physically inactive. Primary care physicians are well-situated to deliver interventions to increase their patients' physical activity levels. However, effective and sustainable physical activity interventions for (pre)diabetes patients that can be translated into routine primary care are lacking. METHODS: We describe the rationale and protocol for a 12-month pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention delivered in general practice to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour of patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (ENERGISED). Twenty-one general practices will recruit 340 patients with (pre)diabetes during routine health check-ups. Patients allocated to the active control arm will receive a Fitbit activity tracker to self-monitor their daily steps and try to achieve the recommended step goal. Patients allocated to the intervention arm will additionally receive the mHealth intervention, including the delivery of several text messages per week, with some of them delivered just in time, based on data continuously collected by the Fitbit tracker. The trial consists of two phases, each lasting six months: the lead-in phase, when the mHealth intervention will be supported with human phone counselling, and the maintenance phase, when the intervention will be fully automated. The primary outcome, average ambulatory activity (steps/day) measured by a wrist-worn accelerometer, will be assessed at the end of the maintenance phase at 12 months. DISCUSSION: The trial has several strengths, such as the choice of active control to isolate the net effect of the intervention beyond simple self-monitoring with an activity tracker, broad eligibility criteria allowing for the inclusion of patients without a smartphone, procedures to minimise selection bias, and involvement of a relatively large number of general practices. These design choices contribute to the trial's pragmatic character and ensure that the intervention, if effective, can be translated into routine primary care practice, allowing important public health benefits.

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were all searched (until February 2021). Inclusion criteria were full-text English articles reporting original data on the use of eHealth technologies in the follow-up of CD patients, with no age restriction. Exclusion criteria were studies only using non-interactive websites and phone consultation as the primary eHealth method. The results were summarized narratively. RESULTS: Using identified keywords, 926 unique studies were identified. After title and abstract screening by two independent reviewers, 26 studies were reviewed in full text. Finally, eight studies were included in this systematic review, and their quality appraised using standardized forms. Of the eight studies, six were randomized-controlled trials, one mixed-methods study, and one cross-sectional, observational study. Studies were assessed to be of ""low"" to ""moderate"" methodological quality. Studied eHealth technologies included web-based interventions, smartphone applications, text messaging, and online consultations. The most consistently reported effects related to improved quality of life (number of studies = 4), knowledge on CD (n = 3), and dietary adherence (n = 2); notably, only one study reported reduced costs of eHealth vs. standard (in-office) care. CONCLUSIONS: Although eHealth has the potential to improve the management of CD, so far, the research in the field is scarce and generally of low-moderate methodological quality. Hence, the effectiveness of eHealth in CD management remains uncertain, and more high-quality evidence is required before its utility is known."

With Louisiana routinely ranked last in indexes of health equity, violent crime rates in Orleans Parish quintupling national averages, and in-care New Orleans people living with HIV surviving twice the US average of adverse childhood experiences, accessible, trauma-focused, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for violence-affected people living with HIV are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: To meet this need, we adapted Living in the Face of Trauma, a well-established EBI tailored for people living with HIV, into NOLA GEM, a just-in-time adaptive mobile health (mHealth) intervention. This study aimed to culturally tailor and refine the NOLA GEM app and assess its acceptability; feasibility; and preliminary efficacy on care engagement, medication adherence, viral suppression, and mental well-being among in-care people living with HIV in Greater New Orleans. METHODS: The development of NOLA GEM entailed identifying real-time tailoring variables via a geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA) study (n=49; aim 1) and place-based and user-centered tailoring, responsive to the unique cultural contexts of HIV survivorship in New Orleans, via formative interviews (n=12; aim 2). The iOS- and Android-enabled NOLA GEM app leverages twice-daily GEMA prompts to offer just-in-time, in-app recommendations for effective coping skills practice and app-delivered Living in the Face of Trauma session content. For aim 3, the pilot trial will enroll an analytic sample of 60 New Orleans people living with HIV individually randomized to parallel NOLA GEM (intervention) or GEMA-alone (control) arms at a 1:1 allocation for a 21-day period. Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed via enrollment, attrition, active daily use through paradata metrics, and prevalidated usability measures. At the postassessment time point, primary end points will be assessed via a range of well-validated, domain-specific scales. Care engagement and viral suppression will be assessed via past missed appointments and self-reported viral load at 30 and 90 days, respectively, and through well-demonstrated adherence self-efficacy measures. RESULTS: Aims 1 and 2 have been achieved, NOLA GEM is in Beta, and all aim-3 methods have been reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Tulane University. Recruitment was launched in July 2023, with a target date for follow-up assessment completion in December 2023. CONCLUSIONS: By leveraging user-centered development and embracing principles that elevate the lived expertise of New Orleans people living with HIV, mHealth-adapted EBIs can reflect community wisdom on posttraumatic resilience. Sustainable adoption of the NOLA GEM app and a promising early efficacy profile will support the feasibility of a future fully powered clinical trial and potential translation to new underserved settings in service of holistic survivorship and well-being of people living with HIV.

Advancements in information technology continue to affect the delivery of patient care in all areas of medicine. Internet-based solutions, social media, and mobile technology could address some of the problems associated with increasing asthma prevalence. OBJECTIVE: This review evaluates Internet-based asthma interventions that were published between 2004 and October 2014 with respect to the use of behavioral change theoretical frameworks, applied clinical guidelines, and assessment tools. METHODS: The search term (Asthma AND [Online or Internet or Mobile or Application or eHealth or App]) was applied to six bibliographic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, BioMed Central, ProQuest Computing, Web of Knowledge, and ACM Digital Library) including only English-language articles published between 2004 and October 2014. In total, 3932 articles matched the priori search terms and were reviewed by the primary reviewer based on their titles, index terms, and abstracts. The matching articles were then screened by the primary reviewer for inclusion or exclusion based on their abstract, study type, and intervention objectives with respect to the full set of priori inclusion and exclusion criteria; 331 duplicates were identified and removed. A total of 85 articles were included for in-depth review and the remaining 3516 articles were excluded. The primary and secondary reviewer independently reviewed the complete content of the 85 included articles to identify the applied behavioral change theories, clinical guidelines, and assessment tools. Findings and any disagreement between reviewers were resolved by in-depth discussion and through a consolidation process for each of the included articles. RESULTS: The reviewers identified 17 out of 85 interventions (20%) where at least one model, framework, and/or construct of a behavioral change theory were applied. The review identified six clinical guidelines that were applied across 30 of the 85 interventions (35%) as well as a total of 21 assessment tools that were applied across 32 of the 85 interventions (38%). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this literature review indicate that the majority of published Internet-based interventions do not use any documented behavioral change theory, clinical guidelines, and/or assessment tools to inform their design. Further, it was found that the application of clinical guidelines and assessment tools were more salient across the reviewed interventions. A consequence, as such, is that many Internet-based asthma interventions are designed in an ad hoc manner, without the use of any notable evidence-based theoretical frameworks, clinical guidelines, and/or assessment tools."

These barriers could be overcome by mobile technologies. EMI (Ecological Momentary Intervention) is a treatment procedure characterized by the delivery of interventions (messages on smartphones) to people in their daily lives. EMI presents opportunities for treatments to be available to people during times and in situations when they are most needed. Craving is a strong predictor of relapse and a key target for addiction treatment. Studies using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) method have revealed that, in daily life, person-specific cues could precipitate craving, that in turn, is associated with a higher probability to report substance use and relapse in the following hours. Assessment and management of these specific situations in daily life could help to decrease addictive use and avoid relapse. The Craving-Manager smartphone app has been designed to diagnose addictive disorders, and assess and manage craving as well as individual predictors of use/relapse. It delivers specific and individualized interventions (counseling messages) composed of evidence-based addiction treatments approaches (cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness). The Craving-Manager app can be used for any addiction (substance or behavior). The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the Craving-Manager app in decreasing use (of primary substance(s)/addictive behavior(s)) over 4 weeks, among individuals on a waiting list for outpatient addiction treatment. METHODS/DESIGN: This multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare two parallel groups: experimental group (full interventional version of the app, 4 weeks, EMA + EMI), versus control group (restricted version of the app, 4 weeks, only EMA). Two hundred and seventy-four participants will be recruited in 6 addiction treatment centers in France. DISCUSSION: This RCT will provide indication on how the Craving-Manager app will reduce addictive use (e.g., better craving management, better stimulus control) in both substance and behavioral addictions. If its efficacy is confirmed, the app could offer the possibility of an easy to use and personalized intervention accessible to the greatest number of individuals with addiction.

Evaluation of Digital Interventions for Physical Activity Promotion: Scoping Review,"De Santis KK, Jahnel T, Matthias K, Mergenthal L, Al Khayyal H, Zeeb H.",JMIR Public Health Surveill. 2022 May 23;8(5):e37820. doi: 10.2196/37820.,De Santis KK,JMIR Public Health Surveill,2022,2022/05/23,PMC9171604,,10.2196/37820,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions are interventions supported by digital tools or technologies, such as mobile apps, wearables, or web-based software. Digital interventions in the context of public health are specifically designed to promote and improve health. Recent reviews have shown that many digital interventions target physical activity promotion; however, it is unclear how such digital interventions are evaluated. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate evaluation strategies in the context of digital interventions for physical activity promotion using a scoping review of published reviews. We focused on the target (ie, user outcomes or tool performance), methods (ie, tool data or self-reported data), and theoretical frameworks of the evaluation strategies. METHODS: A protocol for this study was preregistered and published. From among 300 reviews published up to March 19, 2021 in Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases, 40 reviews (1 rapid, 9 scoping, and 30 systematic) were included in this scoping review. Two authors independently performed study selection and data coding. Consensus was reached by discussion. If applicable, data were coded quantitatively into predefined categories or qualitatively using definitions or author statements from the included reviews. Data were analyzed using either descriptive statistics, for quantitative data (relative frequencies out of all studies), or narrative synthesis focusing on common themes, for qualitative data. RESULTS: Most reviews that were included in our scoping review were published in the period from 2019 to 2021 and originated from Europe or Australia. Most primary studies cited in the reviews included adult populations in clinical or nonclinical settings, and focused on mobile apps or wearables for physical activity promotion. The evaluation target was a user outcome (efficacy, acceptability, usability, feasibility, or engagement) in 38 of the 40 reviews or tool performance in 24 of the 40 reviews. Evaluation methods relied upon objective tool data (in 35/40 reviews) or other data from self-reports or assessments (in 28/40 reviews). Evaluation frameworks based on behavior change theory, including goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback on behavior, and educational or motivational content, were mentioned in 22 out of 40 reviews. Behavior change theory was included in the development phases of digital interventions according to the findings of 20 out of 22 reviews. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of digital interventions is a high priority according to the reviews included in this scoping review. Evaluations of digital interventions, including mobile apps or wearables for physical activity promotion, typically target user outcomes and rely upon objective tool data. Behavior change theory may provide useful guidance not only for development of digital interventions but also for the evaluation of user outcomes in the context of physical activity promotion. Future research should investigate factors that could improve the efficacy of digital interventions and the standardization of terminology and reporting in this field.

Digital Phenotyping for Monitoring Mental Disorders: Systematic Review,"Bufano P, Laurino M, Said S, Tognetti A, Menicucci D.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Dec 13;25:e46778. doi: 10.2196/46778.,Bufano P,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/12/13,PMC10753422,,10.2196/46778,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the impact and spread of mental illness and made health services difficult to access; therefore, there is a need for remote, pervasive forms of mental health monitoring. Digital phenotyping is a new approach that uses measures extracted from spontaneous interactions with smartphones (eg, screen touches or movements) or other digital devices as markers of mental status. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using digital phenotyping for predicting relapse or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with mental disorders through a systematic review of the scientific literature. METHODS: Our research was carried out using 2 bibliographic databases (PubMed and Scopus) by searching articles published up to January 2023. By following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines, we started from an initial pool of 1150 scientific papers and screened and extracted a final sample of 29 papers, including studies concerning clinical populations in the field of mental health, which were aimed at predicting relapse or exacerbation of symptoms. The systematic review has been registered on the web registry Open Science Framework. RESULTS: We divided the results into 4 groups according to mental disorder: schizophrenia (9/29, 31%), mood disorders (15/29, 52%), anxiety disorders (4/29, 14%), and substance use disorder (1/29, 3%). The results for the first 3 groups showed that several features (ie, mobility, location, phone use, call log, heart rate, sleep, head movements, facial and vocal characteristics, sociability, social rhythms, conversations, number of steps, screen on or screen off status, SMS text message logs, peripheral skin temperature, electrodermal activity, light exposure, and physical activity), extracted from data collected via the smartphone and wearable wristbands, can be used to create digital phenotypes that could support gold-standard assessment and could be used to predict relapse or symptom exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, as the data were consistent for almost all the mental disorders considered (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia), the feasibility of this approach was confirmed. In the future, a new model of health care management using digital devices should be integrated with the digital phenotyping approach and tailored mobile interventions (managing crises during relapse or exacerbation)."
Effectiveness of a mobile app-based educational intervention to treat internet gaming disorder among Iranian adolescents: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Pakpour AH, Fazeli S, Zeidi IM, Alimoradi Z, Georgsson M, Brostrom A, Potenza MN.",Trials. 2022 Mar 21;23(1):229. doi: 10.1186/s13063-022-06131-0.,Pakpour AH,Trials,2022,2022/03/22,PMC8935262,,10.1186/s13063-022-06131-0,"BACKGROUND: The use of video games, a hobby for many teenagers in their leisure time, has brought with it a new potential for concerns. Internet gaming disorder (IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due to addictive behaviors. It may include use of video games, both online and offline. Consequences of IGD may include introversion, social anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep problems, behavioral problems, depression, low self-esteem, and increased violence. In order to design an app-based intervention for adolescents, a transtheoretical model (TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field of behavioral change is also practical for health education programs. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve behavioral change. The present study seeks to determine the effectiveness of this app-based intervention in in the treatment of IGD among adolescents. METHOD: In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206 high-school adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be recruited. Eligible adolescents will be randomly assigned into intervention and control groups. Eight consecutive sessions delivered over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT will be delivered through the ;app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. The control group will receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive sessions for 2 months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet Gaming Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and Self-Efficacy. The study measures will be completed at baseline, post intervention, and 1 month and 3 months after the intervention. DISCUSSION: The results of this intervention could be used as adjunct therapy for adolescents with IGD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registration Center of Iran (IRCT) IRCT20181226042140N1 .

Targeting strategies of mHealth interventions for maternal health in low and middle-income countries: a systematic review protocol,"Ilozumba O, Abejirinde IO, Dieleman M, Bardají A, Broerse JEW, Van Belle S.",BMJ Open. 2018 Feb 24;8(2):e019345. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019345.,Ilozumba O,BMJ Open,2018,2018/02/26,PMC5855310,,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019345,"INTRODUCTION: Recently, there has been a steady increase in mobile health (mHealth) interventions aimed at improving maternal health of women in low-income and middle-income countries. While there is evidence indicating that these interventions contribute to improvements in maternal health outcomes, other studies indicate inconclusive results. This uncertainty has raised additional questions, one of which pertains to the role of targeting strategies in implementing mHealth interventions and the focus on pregnant women and health workers as target groups. This review aims to assess who is targeted in different mHealth interventions and the importance of targeting strategies in maternal mHealth interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search for peer-reviewed, English-language literature published between 1999 and July 2017 in PubMed, Web of Knowledge (Science Direct, EMBASE) and Cochrane Central Registers of Controlled Trials. The study scope is defined by the Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes framework: P, community members with maternal or reproductive needs; I, electronic health or mHealth programmes geared at improving maternal or reproductive health; C, other non-electronic health or mHealth-based interventions; O, maternal health measures including family planning, antenatal care attendance, health facility delivery and postnatal care attendance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is a review of already published or publicly available data and needs no ethical approval. Review results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42017072280."
Usability and Engagement Testing of mHealth Apps in Paediatric Obesity: A Narrative Review of Current Literature,"Arthurs N, Tully L, O'Malley G, Browne S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Jan 27;19(3):1453. doi: 10.3390/ijerph19031453.,Arthurs N,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022,2022/02/15,PMC8834793,,10.3390/ijerph19031453,"Mobile health (mHealth) platforms have become increasingly popular for delivering health interventions in recent years and particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Childhood obesity treatment is an area where mHealth interventions may be useful due to the multidisciplinary nature of interventions and the need for long-term care. Many mHealth apps targeting youth exist but the evidence base underpinning the methods for assessing technical usability, user engagement and user satisfaction of such apps with target end-users or among clinical populations is unclear, including for those aimed at paediatric overweight and obesity management. This review aims to examine the current literature and provide an overview of the scientific methods employed to test usability and engagement with mHealth apps in children and adolescents with obesity. A narrative literature review was undertaken following a systematic search. Four academic databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were studies describing the usability of mHealth interventions for childhood obesity treatment. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, fifty-nine articles were included for full-text review, and seven studies met the criteria for usability and engagement in a clinical paediatric population with obesity. Six apps were tested for usability and one for engagement in childhood obesity treatment. Sample sizes ranged from 6-1120 participants. The included studies reported several heterogenous measurement instruments, data collection approaches, and outcomes. Recommendations for future research include the standardization and validation of instruments to measure usability and engagement within mHealth studies in this population."
Lessons from digital technology-enabled health interventions implemented during the coronavirus pandemic to improve maternal and birth outcomes: a global scoping review,"Moise IK, Ivanova N, Wilson C, Wilson S, Halwindi H, Spika VM.",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2023 Mar 20;23(1):195. doi: 10.1186/s12884-023-05454-3.,Moise IK,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,2023,2023/03/21,PMC10026210,,10.1186/s12884-023-05454-3,"BACKGROUND: Timely access to essential obstetric and gynecologic healthcare is an effective method for improving maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted pregnancy care globally. In this global scoping review, we select and investigate peer-reviewed empirical studies related to mHealth and telehealth implemented during the pandemic to support pregnancy care and to improve birth outcomes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science for this Review because they include peer-reviewed literature in the disciplines of behavioral sciences, medicine, clinical sciences, health-care systems, and psychology. Because our investigative searches reviewed that there is considerable 'grey literature' in this area; we did not restrict our review to any study design, methods, or place of publication. In this Review, peer-reviewed preprints were comparable to published peer-reviewed articles, with relevant articles screened accordingly. RESULTS: The search identified 1851 peer reviewed articles, and after removal of duplicates, using inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 22 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review published from January 2020 to May 2022. mHealth interventions accounted for 72.7% (16 of 22 studies) and only 27.3% (6 of 22 studies) were telehealth studies. There were only 3 example studies that integrated digital technologies into healthcare systems and only 3 studies that developed and evaluated the feasibility of mobile apps. Experimental studies accounted 68.8% of mHealth studies and only 33.3% studies of telehealth studies. Key functionalities of the pregnancy apps and telehealth platforms focused on mental and physical wellness, health promotion, patient tracking, health education, and parenting support. Implemented interventions ranged from breastfeeding and selfcare to behavioral health. Facilitators of uptake included perceived benefits, user satisfaction and convenience. Mobile apps and short messaging services were the primary technologies employed in the implemented mHealth interventions. CONCLUSION: Although our Review emphasizes a lack of studies on mHealth interventions and data from pregnant women during the COVID-19 crisis, the review shows that implementation of digital health interventions during emergencies are inevitable given their potential for supporting pregnancy care. There is also a need for more randomized clinical trials and longitudinal studies to better understand the effectiveness and feasibility of implementing such interventions during disease outbreaks and emergencies."
"Fit24, a digital health intervention to reduce type 2 diabetes risk among Hispanic youth: Protocol for a feasibility pilot study","Soltero EG, Lopez C, Musaad SM, O'Connor TM, Thompson D.",Contemp Clin Trials. 2023 Apr;127:107117. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2023.107117. Epub 2023 Feb 10.,Soltero EG,Contemp Clin Trials,2023,2023/02/12,PMC10065958,NIHMS1876490,10.1016/j.cct.2023.107117,"BACKGROUND: Poor physical activity (PA) and sleep behaviors in Hispanic adolescents contributes to increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Commonly owned digital devices and services like smartphones and text-messaging are highly used among adolescents and are promising intervention tools for reaching this age group. Personal activity trackers assess activity and sleep, making them ideal tools for addressing these behaviors. We propose to examine the feasibility of a 12-week intervention that uses theoretically grounded text messages and a Fitbit device to improve PA and sleep among Hispanic adolescents with obesity, as compared to a wait-list control group with a Fitbit device only. METHODS: Participants (N = 48; 14-16 years) will be randomized (1:1) to the intervention or wait-list control group. Youth in the intervention will receive a Fitbit Charge 5 and daily text messages. Youth in the wait-list control group will receive a Fitbit Charge 5 and information on PA and sleep guidelines. RESULTS: Feasibility will be examined by collecting process evaluation data on the following criteria: (1) recruit 48 Hispanic adolescents 14-16 years; (2) retain 85% of participants for post-assessments; (3) Fitbit wear >/=4 days/week and respond to 80% of text messages when prompted; (4) </=10% technical issues; and (5) obtain 80% satisfaction from participants. DISCUSSION: This study will advance our knowledge on the feasibility of digital prevention strategies to promote PA and sleep behaviors to reduce T2D risk among Hispanic youth. If feasible, this approach has the potential to be a scalable, cost-effective diabetes prevention strategy among high-risk youth. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04953442, registered on July 8, 2021."
Can online and app-based interventions be used by people with diabetes to reduce diabetes distress? A protocol for a scoping review,"Andersen CM, Mathiesen AS, Pouwer F, Mouritsen JD, Mathiasen K, Rothmann MJ.",BMJ Open. 2023 Nov 17;13(11):e074015. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2023-074015.,Andersen CM,BMJ Open,2023,2023/11/17,PMC10660435,,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-074015,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetes distress has been defined as ""the negative emotional or affective experience resulting from the challenge of living with the demands of diabetes"". Diabetes distress affects 20%-25% of individuals living with diabetes and can have negative effects on both diabetes regulation and quality of life. For people living with diabetes distress, innovative tools/interventions such as online or app-based interventions may potentially alleviate diabetes distress in a cost-effective way. The specific research questions of this scoping review are: (1) what are the effects of online or app-based interventions on diabetes distress for adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and (2) what are the characteristics of these interventions (eg, type of intervention, duration, frequency, mode of delivery, underlying theories and working mechanisms)? METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review will be conducted, using the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley along with Levac et al. Eligible studies are: studies of adults >/=18 years old with type 1 or 2 diabetes using an online or app-based intervention and assessing diabetes distress as the primary or secondary outcome. Five databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Scopus) will be searched and is limited to articles written in English, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish or Dutch. Two reviewers will independently screen potentially eligible studies in Covidence, select studies, and together chart data, collate, summarise, and report the results. We will adhere to the Preferred reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scoping review has been exempt from full ethical review by the Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern Denmark (case number: S-20232000-88). The results of the review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences and workshops with relevant stakeholders."
Characteristics and Potential Challenges of Digital-Based Interventions for Children and Young People: Scoping Review,"Yun J, Shin J, Lee H, Kim DJ, Choi IY, Kim M.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Apr 14;25:e45465. doi: 10.2196/45465.,Yun J,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/04/14,PMC10148209,,10.2196/45465,"BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies are becoming increasingly available to children and young people and their families. However, there are no scoping reviews that provide both an overview of the characteristics of digital interventions for children and young people and potential challenges to be considered when developing and implementing them. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review scientific publications to identify the current characteristics and potential complications of digital interventions for children and young people. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted using the framework of Arksey and O'Malley and adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews. A search of 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, MEDLINE, and CINAHL) and Google Scholar was performed for eligible clinical trials published between January 1, 2018, and August 19, 2022. RESULTS: The initial search of the 5 databases yielded 3775 citations; duplicates and those not meeting the inclusion criteria were eliminated. In total, 34 articles were included in the final review and relevant information, such as the descriptive characteristics and potential challenges, were classified. Mental health (26/34, 76%) was the most common target for the digital intervention for children and young people, exceeding physical health (8/34, 24%) by more than 3 times. In addition, a substantial number of digital interventions were dedicated solely to children and young people. Digital interventions for children and young people were more likely to be delivered via computers (17/34, 50%) rather than smartphones (13/34, 38%). More than one-third of the studies (13/34, 38%) applied cognitive behavioral theory as the theory of digital interventions. The duration of the digital intervention for children and young people was more likely to vary depending on the target user rather than the target disease. Intervention components were classified into 5 categories: guidance, task and activity, reminder and monitoring, supportive feedback, and reward system. Potential challenges were subcategorized into ethical, interpersonal, and societal challenges. For ethical challenges, the consent of children and young people or caregivers, potential risk of adverse events, and data privacy issues were considered. For interpersonal challenges, the engagement of children and young people was affected by the preference or barrier of caregivers to participate in studies. For societal challenges, restricted ethnicity in recruitment, limited availability of digital technology, differences in internet use patterns between girls and boys, unified clinical settings, and language barriers were described. CONCLUSIONS: We identified potential challenges and provided suggestions about ethical, interpersonal, and societal aspects to consider when developing and deploying digital-based interventions for children and young people. Our findings provide a thorough overview of the published literature and may serve as a comprehensive, informative foundation for the development and implementation of digital-based interventions for children and young people."

Moreover, many patients with FEP remain socially isolated with poor functional outcomes. To address this, our multidisciplinary team has developed a moderated online social media therapy (HORYZONS) designed to enhance social functioning and maintain clinical gains from specialist FEP services. HORYZONS merges: (1) peer-to-peer social networking; (2) tailored therapeutic interventions; (3) expert and peer-moderation; and (4) new models of psychological therapy (strengths and mindfulness-based interventions) targeting social functioning. The aim of this trial is to determine whether following 2 years of specialised support and 18-month online social media-based intervention (HORYZONS) is superior to 18 months of regular care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-blind randomised controlled trial. The treatment conditions include HORYZONS plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. We recruited 170 young people with FEP, aged 16-27 years, in clinical remission and nearing discharge from Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne. The study includes four assessment time points, namely, baseline, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up. The study is due for completion in July 2018 and included a 40-month recruitment period and an 18-month treatment phase. The primary outcome is social functioning at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures include rate of hospital admissions, cost-effectiveness, vocational status, depression, social support, loneliness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, anxiety, psychological well-being, satisfaction with life, quality of life, positive and negative psychotic symptoms and substance use. Social functioning will be also assessed in real time through our Smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment tool.

Findings will be made available through scientific journals and forums and to the public via social media and the Orygen website. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12614000009617; Pre-results."
Reducing Drinking Among People Experiencing Homelessness: Protocol for the Development and Testing of a Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention,"Businelle MS, Walters ST, Mun EY, Kirchner TR, Hébert ET, Li X.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Apr 16;9(4):e15610. doi: 10.2196/15610.,Businelle MS,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/04/17,PMC7193437,,10.2196/15610,"BACKGROUND: Adults who are homeless are more likely to have alcohol use disorders (AUDs) compared with domiciled adults. Although AUD treatments are commonly available, many factors (eg, transportation limitations and inability to schedule appointments) contribute to low treatment completion rates and low success rates of these interventions among adults experiencing homelessness. Most adults who are homeless own mobile phones; however, no interventions have been developed that use mobile devices to deliver and support AUD interventions for this population. Mobile phone-based AUD interventions may reduce barriers that have limited the use and utility of traditional interventions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to (1) identify variables (eg, affect, stress, geolocation, and cravings) that predict drinking among homeless adults (phase I), (2) develop a mobile intervention that utilizes an algorithm to identify moments of risk for drinking and deliver treatment messages that are tailored to the individual's current needs in real time (phase II), and (3) pilot test the intervention app (phase III). METHODS: In phase I, adults experiencing homelessness with an AUD (N=80) will complete baseline, equipment, 2-week, and 4-week follow-up visits in person. Participants will be prompted to complete five daily ecological momentary assessments on a study-provided smartphone for 28 days. The smartphone app will collect GPS coordinates every 5 min for the entire 28-day study period. Participants will wear a transdermal alcohol sensor that will objectively measure alcohol use. In phase II, we will use phase I data to develop an algorithm that identifies moments of heightened risk for drinking and develop treatment messages that address risk factors for drinking. Phase III will pilot test the intervention in 40 adults experiencing homelessness with AUD. RESULTS: This project was funded in June 2018. IRB approval was obtained in October 2018, and data collection for phase I began in February 2019. Phase III data collection is expected to conclude in 2020. To date, 80 participants have consented to the study, and data analysis for phase I will begin in early 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This research will highlight intervention targets and develop a novel intervention for understudied and underserved adults experiencing homelessness with AUD.

Due to language and cultural barriers, there is need for specifically adapted therapeutic procedures for refugees in inpatient mental health care settings. Internet-based applications in refugee mother tongues have the potential to improve the outcomes of mental health care for this vulnerable population. The key research question of the present implementation study is whether the newly developed ""blended ALMAMAR"" app for Arabic and Farsi speaking refugees in Germany is used and accepted by patients and professionals in routine inpatient mental health care (blended care). METHODS: We present the design of an observational, prospective multicenter implementation study in eight psychiatric hospitals. We plan to recruit 100 Farsi or Arabic speaking refugees receiving in-patient treatment due to depression, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder or substance use disorders. These patients will get access to the ""blended ALMAMAR"" app during their inpatient stay in a blended-care approach. We will assess the usage (e.g., duration and frequency of use of the app) as well as subjective acceptability and usability of the intervention. To identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with ""blended ALMAMAR"" usage, we will also perform clinical and questionnaire assessments. DISCUSSION: The newly developed ""blended ALMAMAR"" app may help to close communication gaps for the hard-to reach and vulnerable group of refugees in inpatient mental health care. It is the first blended-care intervention that addresses severely mentally ill refugees in an inpatient psychiatric setting in Germany. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register on November 11, 2021 (DRKS00025972) and adapted on November 14, 2023."
The Impact of Digital Technology on Self-Management in Cancer: Systematic Review,"Lim DSC, Kwok B, Williams P, Koczwara B.",JMIR Cancer. 2023 Nov 22;9:e45145. doi: 10.2196/45145.,Lim DSC,JMIR Cancer,2023,2023/11/22,PMC10701654,,10.2196/45145,"BACKGROUND: Self-management (SM) plays an important role in supporting patients' adaptation to and management of the symptoms of chronic diseases. Cancer is a chronic disease that requires patients to have responsibility in management. Digital technology has the potential to enhance SM support, but there is little data on what SM skills are most commonly supported by digital technology. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to examine the SM core skills that were enabled and supported by digital interventions in people with cancer and identify any predictors of the effect of digital health intervention on SM core skills. METHODS: Three electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL) were searched for papers, published from January 2010 to February 2022, that reported randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with cancer or survivors of cancer where a digital technology intervention was evaluated and change in 1 or more SM core skills was a measured outcome. RESULTS: This systematic review resulted in 12 studies that were eligible to identify which SM core skills were enabled and supported by digital intervention. The total number of participants in the 12 studies was 2627. The most common SM core skills targeted by interventions were decision-making, goal setting, and partnering with health professionals. A total of 8 (67%) out of 12 RCTs demonstrated statistically significant improvement in outcomes including self-efficacy, survivorship care knowledge and attitude, quality of life, increased knowledge of treatment, and emotional and social functioning. A total of 5 (62%) out of 8 positive RCTs used theoretical considerations in their study design; whereas in 1 (25%) out of 4 negative RCTs, theoretical considerations were used. In 3 studies, some factors were identified that were associated with the development of SM core skills, which included younger age (regression coefficient [RC]=-0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to -0.02; P=.002), computer literacy (RC=-0.20, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.03; P=.02), completing cancer treatment (Cohen d=0.31), male sex (SD 0.34 in social functioning; P=.009), higher education (SD 0.19 in social functioning; P=.04), and being a recipient of chemotherapy (SD 0.36 in depression; P=.008). In all 3 studies, there were no shared identical factors that supported the development of SM core skills, whereby each study had a unique set of factors that supported the development of SM core skills. CONCLUSIONS: Digital technology for patients with cancer appears to improve SM core skills including decision-making, goal setting, and partnering with health care partners. This effect is greater in people who are younger, male, educated, highly computer literate, completing cancer treatment, or a recipient of chemotherapy. Future research should focus on targeting multiple SM core skills and identifying predictors of the effect of digital technology intervention.

Evaluating the role of digital intervention design in treatment outcomes and adherence to eTherapy programs for eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Barakat S, Maguire S, Smith KE, Mason TB, Crosby RD, Touyz S.",Int J Eat Disord. 2019 Oct;52(10):1077-1094. doi: 10.1002/eat.23131. Epub 2019 Jul 22.,Barakat S,Int J Eat Disord,2019,2019/07/23,,,10.1002/eat.23131,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the existence of reviews which document the effectiveness of online therapies, there is little consensus regarding the exact components of online treatment delivery that are most effective in maintaining user engagement and reducing eating disorder (ED) symptomology. The current review and meta-analysis aimed to determine which components of web-based, ED self-help interventions are associated with lower attrition and improved therapeutic outcome. METHOD: A systematic search of electronic databases (PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus) was conducted for published studies of web-based interventions for EDs and a meta-analysis of the final included studies was performed. Each intervention was coded across four dimensions, including the multimedia channels employed (e.g., text, audio, videos), degree of user interactivity (e.g., online self-monitoring, skills exercises), level of automated feedback (e.g., reminders, personalized feedback), and technological device through which the program was accessed (e.g., smartphone, computer). RESULTS: A final 23 papers were included. The results of meta-regressions indicated that higher scores on the multimedia subscale were associated with greater ED symptom improvement in treatment groups. Conversely, a higher degree of feedback in the treatment group was associated with a group difference in ED psychopathology favoring the control group. Other intervention components were not associated with treatment outcome or dropout. DISCUSSION: The results are discussed in relation to limitations of the scale used to quantify digital intervention features, as well as the limited diversity and technological sophistication of available ED digital interventions. Such findings indicate the importance of understanding the digital components, which differentiate online therapeutic programs."
Enhanced Patient Activation in Cancer Care Transitions: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Tailored Electronic Health Intervention for Men With Prostate Cancer,"Ekstedt M, Schildmeijer K, Wennerberg C, Nilsson L, Wannheden C, Hellström A.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Mar 22;8(3):e11625. doi: 10.2196/11625.,Ekstedt M,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/03/23,PMC6450475,,10.2196/11625,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer has increased in incidence worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer death in 24 countries. The most common treatment is radical prostatectomy. However, surgery is associated with postoperative complications such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction, causing decreased quality of life. If survivors are encouraged to be more active in self-care management, the symptom burden may decrease and quality of life may improve. An electronic health (eHealth) intervention based on motivational behavioral theory has been developed for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of standard care in combination with a tailored eHealth and mobile health self-management support system, electronic Patient Activation in Treatment at Home (ePATH), with standard care of adverse effects of prostate cancer treatment (urinary incontinence and sexual functioning) in men undergoing radical prostatectomy. The secondary aim was to test the effect on patient activaftion, motivation, overall well-being, and health literacy over time in and between groups. METHODS: A pragmatic multicenter, block-randomized controlled trial with 2 study arms, standard care (control) and eHealth-assisted standard care (intervention), for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. For 80% power, a sample of 242 men will need to be recruited. RESULTS: Recruitment started in January 2018 and is expected to be completed by August 2019. Data collection will be completed in August 2020. The first cross-sectional results from this trial are anticipated to be published in January 2020. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing number of prostate cancer survivors, attention should be paid to rehabilitation, psychosocial care, and support for endurance of self-care to reduce suffering from adverse treatment effects, poor quality of life, and depression because of postoperative complications. This project may increase knowledge of how patients can be supported to feel involved in their care and returning to as normal a life as possible. The anticipated effects of ePATH could improve health outcomes for individuals and facilitate follow-up for health care professionals.

"mHealth Intervention for Improving Pain, Quality of Life, and Functional Disability in Patients With Chronic Pain: Systematic Review","Moreno-Ligero M, Moral-Munoz JA, Salazar A, Failde I.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Feb 2;11:e40844. doi: 10.2196/40844.,Moreno-Ligero M,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/02/02,PMC9936365,,10.2196/40844,"BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) is 1 of the leading causes of disability worldwide and represents a significant burden on individual, social, and economic aspects. Potential tools, such as mobile health (mHealth) systems, are emerging for the self-management of patients with CP. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to analyze the effects of mHealth interventions on CP management, based on pain intensity, quality of life (QoL), and functional disability assessment, compared to conventional treatment or nonintervention. METHODS: PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines were followed to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases from February to March 2022. No filters were used. The eligibility criteria were RCTs of adults (>/=18 years old) with CP, intervened with mHealth systems based on mobile apps for monitoring pain and health-related outcomes, for pain and behavioral self-management, and for performing therapeutic approaches, compared to conventional treatments (physical, occupational, and psychological therapies; usual medical care; and education) or nonintervention, reporting pain intensity, QoL, and functional disability. The methodological quality and risk of bias (RoB) were assessed using the Checklist for Measuring Quality, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence, and the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. RESULTS: In total, 22 RCTs, involving 2641 patients with different CP conditions listed in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11), including chronic low back pain (CLBP), chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP), chronic neck pain (CNP), unspecified CP, chronic pelvic pain (CPP), fibromyalgia (FM), interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and osteoarthritis (OA). A total of 23 mHealth systems were used to conduct a variety of CP self-management strategies, among which monitoring pain and symptoms and home-based exercise programs were the most used. Beneficial effects of the use of mHealth systems in reducing pain intensity (CNP, FM, IC/BPS, and OA), QoL (CLBP, CNP, IBS, and OA), and functional disability (CLBP, CMSP, CNP, and OA) were found. Most of the included studies (18/22, 82%) reported medium methodological quality and were considered as highly recommendable; in addition, 7/22 (32%) studies had a low RoB, 10/22 (45%) had some concerns, and 5/22 (23%) had a high RoB. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mHealth systems indicated positive effects for pain intensity in CNP, FM, IC/BPS, and OA; for QoL in CLBP, CNP, IBS, and OA; and for functional disability in CLBP, CMSP, CNP, and OA. Thus, mHealth seems to be an alternative to improving pain-related outcomes and QoL and could be part of multimodal strategies for CP self-management. High-quality studies are needed to merge the evidence and recommendations of the use of mHealth systems for CP management.

Patient-Facing Mobile Apps to Support Physiotherapy Care: Protocol for a Systematic Review of Apps Within App Stores,"Merolli M, Francis JJ, Vallance P, Bennell KL, Malliaras P, Hinman RS.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Dec 9;10(12):e29047. doi: 10.2196/29047.,Merolli M,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/12/10,PMC8704116,,10.2196/29047,"BACKGROUND: Care delivered by physiotherapists aims to facilitate engagement in positive health behaviors by patients (eg, adherence to exercise). However, research suggests that behavioral interventions are frequently omitted from care. Hence, better understanding of strategies that can be used by physiotherapists to support patients to engage in positive behaviors is important and likely to optimize outcomes. Digital health interventions delivered via mobile apps are garnering attention for their ability to support behavior change. They have potential to incorporate numerous behavior change techniques (BCTs) to support goals of physiotherapy care, including but not limited to self-monitoring, goal setting, and prompts/alerts. Despite their potential to support physiotherapy care, much is still unknown about what apps are available to consumers, the BCTs they use, their quality, and their potential to change behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to systematically review the mobile apps available in app stores that are intended for use by patients to support physiotherapy care, including the BCTs within these apps. The secondary aims are to evaluate the quality and behavior change potential of these apps. METHODS: A systematic review of mobile apps in app stores will be undertaken. This will be guided by recommendations for systematic reviews in line with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement but adapted to suit our app store search, consistent with similar systematic reviews of apps published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. Apple Store and Google Play will be searched with a two-step search strategy, using terms relevant to physiotherapy, physiotherapists, and common physiotherapy care. Key eligibility criteria will include apps that are intended for use by patients and are self-contained or stand-alone without the need of additional wearable devices or other add-ons. Included apps will be coded for BCTs and rated for quality using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) and for potential to change behavior using the App Behavior Change Scale (ABACUS). RESULTS: App store search and screening are expected to be completed in 2021. Data extraction and quality appraisal are expected to commence by November 2021. The study results are expected to be published in a subsequent paper in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge gained from this review will support clinical practice and inform research by providing a greater understanding of the quality of currently available mobile apps and their potential to support patient behavior change goals of physiotherapy care.

Mobile App-Based Interventions to Support Diabetes Self-Management: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials to Identify Functions Associated with Glycemic Efficacy,"Wu Y, Yao X, Vespasiani G, Nicolucci A, Dong Y, Kwong J, Li L, Sun X, Tian H, Li S.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2017 Mar 14;5(3):e35. doi: 10.2196/mhealth.6522.,Wu Y,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2017,2017/03/16,PMC5373677,,10.2196/mhealth.6522,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health apps for diabetes self-management have different functions. However, the efficacy and safety of each function are not well studied, and no classification is available for these functions. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) develop and validate a taxonomy of apps for diabetes self-management, (2) investigate the glycemic efficacy of mobile app-based interventions among adults with diabetes in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and (3) explore the contribution of different function to the effectiveness of entire app-based interventions using the taxonomy. METHODS: We developed a 3-axis taxonomy with columns of clinical modules, rows of functional modules and cells of functions with risk assessments. This taxonomy was validated by reviewing and classifying commercially available diabetes apps. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2007 to May 2016. We included RCTs of adult outpatients with diabetes that compared using mobile app-based interventions with usual care alone. The mean differences (MDs) in hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) concentrations and risk ratios of adverse events were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. After taxonomic classification, we performed exploratory subgroup analyses of the presence or absence of each module across the included app-based interventions. RESULTS: Across 12 included trials involving 974 participants, using app-based interventions was associated with a clinically significant reduction of HbA(1c) (MD 0.48%, 95% CI 0.19%-0.77%) without excess adverse events. Larger HbA(1c) reductions were noted among patients with type 2 diabetes than those with type 1 diabetes (MD 0.67%, 95% CI 0.30%-1.03% vs MD 0.36%, 95% CI 0.08%-0.81%). Having a complication prevention module in app-based interventions was associated with a greater HbA(1c) reduction (with complication prevention: MD 1.31%, 95% CI 0.66%-1.96% vs without: MD 0.38%, 95% CI 0.09%-0.67%; intersubgroup P=.01), as was having a structured display (with structured display: MD 0.69%, 95% CI 0.32%-1.06% vs without: MD 0.16%, 95% CI 0.16%-0.48%; intersubgroup P=.03). However, having a clinical decision-making function was not associated with a larger HbA(1c) reduction (with clinical decision making: MD 0.18%, 95% CI 0.21%-0.56% vs without: MD 0.61%, 95% CI 0.27%-0.95%; intersubgroup P=.10). CONCLUSIONS: The use of mobile app-based interventions yields a clinically significant HbA(1c) reduction among adult outpatients with diabetes, especially among those with type 2 diabetes. Our study suggests that the clinical decision-making function needs further improvement and evaluation before being added to apps."

To ensure the dissemination of psychological treatments for these conditions, novel forms of delivery (e.g., Internet or mobile apps) and more scalable forms of psychotherapy (e.g., transdiagnostic interventions) have become increasingly popular. Research, however, shows that a significant number of patients, around 40 % according to some studies, do not respond to the interventions as expected (i.e., not-on-track patients). Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) could simplify tailoring treatments to the patients' progress and rapidly respond to undesired outcomes during psychotherapy. Therefore, these would facilitate measurement-based care with little therapist involvement. This study aims to explore the feasibility of an app-based system called My EMI, Emotional Well-being for people with emotional disorders. According to daily EMAs, the app will provide personalized EMIs while participants receive a self-applied online transdiagnostic treatment. The app will be used as an add-tool to the online intervention to address emotion dysregulation, foster adherence, and reinforce contents. The current study describes the study protocol for this trial. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A single-group, open trial design will be used. Participants will be 30 adults suffering from emotional disorders. Primary outcomes will be app usability, acceptability, and response rates. Secondary outcomes will be either evaluated in Qualtrics at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up (depression and anxiety severity, and transdiagnostic dimensions of emotional disorders) or daily throughout the study with the app (EMAs of mood and five transdiagnostic mechanisms of therapeutic change). EMIs will consist of brief, evidence-based transdiagnostic CBT digital content (images, infographics, or videos) delivered just-in-time. Only if problems persist, short phone calls or episodic videocalls will be conducted. The Ethics Committee of the Jaume I University approved the study and all its procedures (CD/111/2021) in December 2021. DISCUSSION: Identifying personalized and scalable interventions is paramount to improve mental health care, especially its accessibility, and to reduce the psychological distress of people with mental health problems. Feasibility data of the app (EMA and EMI system) supported by a self-applied online transdiagnostic intervention will be important to explore whether this modern approach is a real option to move forward personalized psychological interventions for persons with emotional disorders.

This study is set to determine the effectiveness of the ""KmAsthma"" self-management app in improving the control of asthma among adolescents in a low-resource setting. METHODS: The two-arm 6-month cluster randomized controlled trial, will aim at enrolling 120 day scholars aged 12-19 years in secondary schools with a clinician's diagnosis and self-reported uncontrolled asthma in Kampala City Uganda. The primary endpoint of asthma control will be measured as a change in mean Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores. Asthma quality of life, adherence to medications, and self-efficacy will also be assessed. The iMprovIng the ContROl of aSthma (MICROS) study will employ the ""KmAsthma"" app for self-management education. The intervention group will receive the app on their smartphones and training on its eight sections: the profile, asthma history, goals, inspirations, reminders, connect, information about asthma, and emergency support. Participants will navigate these sections to set asthma control goals, schedule medication reminders, log daily symptoms, and receive guidance for attacks. All participants will be encouraged to seek routine care. A study nurse will follow up with each participant via the phone six weeks post-intervention. The MICROS study was approved by the Makerere University School of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology. This protocol is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05850806). CONCLUSION: The MICROS study will provide comprehensive insights into how effective a mHealth intervention can be an aid for adolescents in a low-resource setting in managing their asthma. The findings of this study will contribute to filling the gap leading to unsatisfactory asthma control in adolescents."
Improving Medication Adherence Through Adaptive Digital Interventions (iMedA) in Patients With Hypertension: Protocol for an Interrupted Time Series Study,"Etminani K, Göransson C, Galozy A, Norell Pejner M, Nowaczyk S.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 May 12;10(5):e24494. doi: 10.2196/24494.,Etminani K,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/05/12,PMC8156113,,10.2196/24494,"BACKGROUND: There is a strong need to improve medication adherence (MA) for individuals with hypertension in order to reduce long-term hospitalization costs. We believe this can be achieved through an artificial intelligence agent that helps the patient in understanding key individual adherence risk factors and designing an appropriate intervention plan. The incidence of hypertension in Sweden is estimated at approximately 27%. Although blood pressure control has increased in Sweden, barely half of the treated patients achieved adequate blood pressure levels. It is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke as well as heart failure. MA is a key factor for good clinical outcomes in persons with hypertension. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study is to design, develop, test, and evaluate an adaptive digital intervention called iMedA, delivered via a mobile app to improve MA, self-care management, and blood pressure control for persons with hypertension. METHODS: The study design is an interrupted time series. We will collect data on a daily basis, 14 days before, during 6 months of delivering digital interventions through the mobile app, and 14 days after. The effect will be analyzed using segmented regression analysis. The participants will be recruited in Region Halland, Sweden. The design of the digital interventions follows the just-in-time adaptive intervention framework. The primary (distal) outcome is MA, and the secondary outcome is blood pressure. The design of the digital intervention is developed based on a needs assessment process including a systematic review, focus group interviews, and a pilot study, before conducting the longitudinal interrupted time series study. RESULTS: The focus groups of persons with hypertension have been conducted to perform the needs assessment in a Swedish context. The design and development of digital interventions are in progress, and the interventions are planned to be ready in November 2020. Then, the 2-week pilot study for usability evaluation will start, and the interrupted time series study, which we plan to start in February 2021, will follow it. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that iMedA will improve medication adherence and self-care management. This study could illustrate how self-care management tools can be an additional (digital) treatment support to a clinical one without increasing burden on health care staff.

Few interventions, however, have been developed specifically for this age group. OBJECTIVE: In this randomized trial, we will provide a mobile app (SweetGoals) to all participants as a ""core"" intervention. The app prompts participants to upload data from their diabetes devices weekly to a device-agnostic uploader (Glooko), automatically retrieves uploaded data, assesses daily and weekly self-management goals, and generates feedback messages about goal attainment. Further, the trial will test two unique intervention components: (1) incentives to promote consistent daily adherence to goals, and (2) web health coaching to teach effective problem solving focused on personalized barriers to self-management. We will use a novel digital direct-to-patient recruitment method and intervention delivery model that transcends the clinic. METHODS: A 2x2 factorial randomized trial will be conducted with 300 young adults ages 19-25 with type 1 diabetes and (Hb)A(1c) >/= 8.0%. All participants will receive the SweetGoals app that tracks and provides feedback about two adherence targets: (a) daily glucose monitoring; and (b) mealtime behaviors. Participants will be randomized to the factorial combination of incentives and health coaching. The intervention will last 6 months. The primary outcome will be reduction in A(1c). Secondary outcomes include self-regulation mechanisms in longitudinal mediation models and engagement metrics as a predictor of outcomes. Participants will complete 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. We hypothesize greater sustained A(1c) improvements in participants who receive coaching and who receive incentives compared to those who do not receive those components. RESULTS: Data collection is expected to be complete by February 2025. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes are expected by December 2025. CONCLUSIONS: Successful completion of these aims will support dissemination and effectiveness studies of this intervention that seeks to improve glycemic control in this high-risk and understudied population of young adults with T1D.

We systematically reviewed the literature to determine the impact of mHealth interventions on health care quality for non-communicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries and to identify knowledge gaps in this rapidly evolving field. Overall, we found few high-quality studies. Most studies narrowly focused on text messaging systems for patient behavior change, and few studies examined the health systems strengthening aspects of mHealth. There were limited literature reporting clinical effectiveness, costs, and patient acceptability, and none reporting equity and safety issues. Despite the bold promise of mHealth to improve health care, much remains unknown about whether and how this will be fulfilled. Encouragingly, we identified some registered clinical trial protocols of large-scale, multidimensional mHealth interventions, suggesting that the current limited evidence base will expand in coming years."
The Use of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Mobile Apps for Supporting a Healthy Diet and Controlling Hypertension in Adults: Systematic Review,"Alnooh G, Alessa T, Hawley M, de Witte L.",JMIR Cardio. 2022 Nov 2;6(2):e35876. doi: 10.2196/35876.,Alnooh G,JMIR Cardio,2022,2022/11/02,PMC9669886,,10.2196/35876,"BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hypertension is a public health issue, with increasing prevalence worldwide. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is one of the most effective dietary approaches for lowering blood pressure (BP). Dietary mobile apps have gained popularity and are being used to support DASH diet self-management, aiming to improve DASH diet adherence and thus lower BP. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of smartphone apps that support self-management to improve DASH diet adherence and consequently reduce BP. A secondary aim was to assess engagement, satisfaction, acceptance, and usability related to DASH mobile app use. METHODS: The Embase (OVID), Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar electronic databases were used to conduct systematic searches for studies conducted between 2008 and 2021 that used DASH smartphone apps to support self-management. The reference lists of the included articles were also checked. Studies were eligible if they (1) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or pre-post studies of app-based interventions for adults (aged 18 years or above) with prehypertension or hypertension, without consideration of gender or sociodemographic characteristics; (2) used mobile phone apps alone or combined with another component, such as communication with others; (3) used or did not use any comparator; and (4) had the primary outcome measures of BP level and adherence to the DASH diet. For eligible studies, data were extracted and outcomes were organized into logical categories, including clinical outcomes (eg, systolic BP, diastolic BP, and weight loss), DASH diet adherence, app usability and acceptability, and user engagement and satisfaction. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, and nonrandomized quantitative studies were evaluated using a tool provided by the US National Institutes of Health. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies (3 RCTs and 2 pre-post studies) including 334 participants examined DASH mobile apps. All studies found a positive trend related to the use of DASH smartphone apps, but the 3 RCTs had a high risk of bias. One pre-post study had a high risk of bias, while the other had a low risk. As a consequence, no firm conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of DASH smartphone apps for increasing DASH diet adherence and lowering BP. All the apps appeared to be acceptable and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: There is weak emerging evidence of a positive effect of using DASH smartphone apps for supporting self-management to improve DASH diet adherence and consequently lower BP. Further research is needed to provide high-quality evidence that can determine the effectiveness of DASH smartphone apps."
Does providing a brief internet intervention for hazardous alcohol use to people seeking online help for depression reduce both alcohol use and depression symptoms among participants with these co-occurring disorders? Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Cunningham JA, Hendershot CS, Kay-Lambkin F, Neighbors C, Griffiths KM, Bennett K, Bennett A, Godinho A, Schell C.",BMJ Open. 2018 Jul 19;8(7):e022412. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022412.,Cunningham JA,BMJ Open,2018,2018/07/22,PMC6059322,,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022412,"INTRODUCTION: Hazardous alcohol consumption is common among people experiencing depression, often acting to exacerbate depressive symptoms. While many people with these co-occurring disorders do not seek face-to-face treatment, they do seek help online. There are effective internet interventions that target hazardous alcohol consumption or depression separately but none that combine these online interventions without the involvement of a therapist. In order to realise the potential of internet interventions, we need to develop an evidence base supporting the efficacy of internet interventions for co-occurring depression and hazardous alcohol use without any therapist involvement. This study aims to evaluate the effects on drinking, and on depressive symptoms, of combining an internet intervention targeting hazardous alcohol consumption with one for depression. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A double blinded, parallel group randomised controlled trial will be used. Participants with current depression who also drink in a hazardous fashion (n=986) will be recruited for a study to 'help improve an online intervention for depression'. Participants will be randomised either to receive an established online intervention for depression (MoodGYM) or to receive MoodGYM plus a brief internet intervention for hazardous alcohol consumption (Check Your Drinking; CYD). Participants will be contacted 3 and 6 months after receiving the interventions to assess changes in drinking and depression symptoms. It is predicted that participants receiving the CYD intervention in addition to MoodGYM will report greater postintervention reductions in alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms compared with those who received MoodGYM only. Hypothesised mediation and moderation effects will also be investigated. Using an intention-to-treat basis for the analyses, the hypotheses will be tested using a generalised linear hypothesis framework, and longitudinal analyses will use either generalised linear mixed modelling or generalised estimating equation approach where appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research comprises the crucial first steps in developing lower-cost and efficacious internet interventions for people suffering from depression who also drink in a hazardous fashion-promoting the widespread availability of care for those in need. This study has been approved by the standing ethics review committee of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and findings will be disseminated in the form of at least one peer-reviewed article and presentations at conferences.

Food Allergy Symptom Self-Management With Technology (FASST) mHealth Intervention to Address Psychosocial Outcomes in Caregivers of Children With Newly Diagnosed Food Allergy: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Broome B, Madisetti M, Prentice M, Williams KW, Kelechi T.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Mar 3;10(3):e25805. doi: 10.2196/25805.,Broome B,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/03/03,PMC7970224,,10.2196/25805,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 2.4 million children in the United States suffer from food-induced anaphylaxis, a condition that is annually responsible for over 200 deaths and 200,000 emergency room visits. As a result, caregivers of children newly diagnosed with severe and life-threatening food allergic reactions experience clinically significant symptoms of psychological distress, including fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood, social isolation, and substantially reduced quality of life. Despite this recognition, there is a lack of caregiver-centered self-management interventions to address these concerns. OBJECTIVE: In this protocol, we propose to develop and conduct feasibility testing of a technology-enhanced, self-management, mobile health, smartphone app intervention called Food Allergy Symptom Self-Management with Technology for Caregivers (FASST) designed to meet the psychosocial health needs of caregivers of children with a new diagnosis of food allergy. METHODS: This pilot study uses qualitative work (Phase I) to inform a 4-week longitudinal randomized controlled trial (Phase II). In Phase I, 10 caregivers of children (</=18 years old) with established food allergy (>/=1 year from diagnosis) will participate in semistructured interviews to inform the development of the FASST app. In Phase II, 30 caregivers of children (</=18 years old) with a newly diagnosed food allergy (</=90 days from diagnosis) will be randomized 2:1 to receive the FASST intervention (n=20) or control condition (basic app with educational resources; n=10). Process measures include feasibility, caregiver acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction. Outcome measures include caregiver fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep, self-efficacy, and quality of life measured at baseline, week 4, and 3 months post study completion. RESULTS: Phase I study activities have been completed, and Phase II participant enrollment into the randomized controlled trial is expected to commence in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: With limited readily available resources at their disposal, the results from this study have the potential to provide caregivers of children with a newly diagnosed food allergy a tool to help them self-manage and mitigate negative psychosocial factors during a critical time period in the caregiving/condition trajectory.

Testing the Effects of App-Based Motivational Messages on Physical Activity and Resting Heart Rate Through Smartphone App Compliance in Patients With Vulnerable Coronary Artery Plaques: Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial,"Mitra S, Kroeger CM, Xu J, Avery L, Masedunskas A, Cassidy S, Wang T, Hunyor I, Wilcox I, Huang R, Chakraborty B, Fontana L.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Oct 2;12:e46082. doi: 10.2196/46082.,Mitra S,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/10/02,PMC10580140,,10.2196/46082,"BACKGROUND: Achieving the weekly physical activity recommendations of at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise is important for reducing cardiometabolic risk, but evidence shows that most people struggle to meet these goals, particularly in the mid to long term. OBJECTIVE: The Messages Improving Resting Heart Health (MIRTH) study aims to determine if (1) sending daily motivational messages through a research app is effective in improving motivation and in promoting adherence to physical activity recommendations in men and women with coronary heart disease randomized to a 12-month intensive lifestyle intervention, and (2) the time of the day when the message is delivered impacts compliance with exercise training. METHODS: We will conduct a single-center, microrandomized trial. Participants will be randomized daily to either receive or not receive motivational messages over two 90-day periods at the beginning (phase 1: months 4-6) and at the end (phase 2: months 10-12) of the Lifestyle Vulnerable Plaque Study. Wrist-worn devices (Fitbit Inspire 2) and Bluetooth pairing with smartphones will be used to passively collect data for proximal (ie, physical activity duration, steps walked, and heart rate within 180 minutes of receiving messages) and distal (ie, change values for resting heart rate and total steps walked within and across both phases 1 and 2 of the trial) outcomes. Participants will be recruited from a large academic cardiology office practice (Central Sydney Cardiology) and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Departments of Cardiology and Radiology. All clinical investigations will be undertaken at the Charles Perkins Centre Royal Prince Alfred clinic. Individuals aged 18-80 years (n=58) with stable coronary heart disease who have low attenuation plaques based on a coronary computed tomography angiography within the past 3 months and have been randomized to an intensive lifestyle intervention program will be included in MIRTH. RESULTS: The Lifestyle Vulnerable Plaque Study was funded in 2020 and started enrolling participants in February 2022. Recruitment for MIRTH commenced in November 2022. As of September 2023, 2 participants were enrolled in the MIRTH study and provided baseline data. CONCLUSIONS: This MIRTH microrandomized trial will represent the single most detailed and integrated analysis of the effects of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention delivered through a customized mobile health app on smart devices on time-based motivational messaging for patients with coronary heart disease. This study will also help inform future studies optimizing for just-in-time adaptive interventions.

The Impact of Digital Health Interventions for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes on Health and Social Care Utilisation and Costs: A Systematic Review,"Morris T, Aspinal F, Ledger J, Li K, Gomes M.",Pharmacoecon Open. 2023 Mar;7(2):163-173. doi: 10.1007/s41669-022-00377-9. Epub 2022 Dec 10.,Morris T,Pharmacoecon Open,2023,2022/12/10,PMC10043074,,10.1007/s41669-022-00377-9,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions such as smartphone applications (mHealth) or Internet resources (eHealth) are increasingly used to improve the management of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. These digital health interventions can augment or replace traditional health services and may be paid for using healthcare budgets. While the impact of digital health interventions for the management of type 2 diabetes on health outcomes has been reviewed extensively, less attention has been paid to their economic impact. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to critically review existing literature on the impact of digital health interventions for the management of type 2 diabetes on health and social care utilisation and costs. METHODS: Studies that assessed the impact on health and social care utilisation of digital health interventions for type 2 diabetes were included in the study. We restricted the digital health interventions to information provision, self-management and behaviour management. Four databases were searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and EconLit) for articles published between January 2010 and March 2021. The studies were analysed using a narrative synthesis approach. The risk of bias and reporting quality were appraised using the ROBINS-I checklist. RESULTS: The review included 22 studies. Overall, studies reported mixed evidence on the impact of digital health interventions on health and social care utilisation and costs, and suggested this impact differs according to the healthcare utilisation component. For example, digital health intervention use was associated with lower medication use and fewer outpatient appointments, whereas evidence on general practitioner visits and inpatient admissions was mixed. Most reviewed studies focus on a single component of healthcare utilisation. CONCLUSIONS: The review shows no clear evidence of an impact of digital health interventions on health and social care utilisation or costs. Further work is needed to assess the impact of digital health interventions across a broader range of care utilisation components and settings, including social and mental healthcare services. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO before searches began in April 2021 (registration number: CRD42020172621)."
A Smartphone-Based Intervention for Anxiety and Depression in Racially and Ethnically Diverse Adults (EASE): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Garey L, Zvolensky MJ, Gallagher MW, Vujanovic A, Kendzor DE, Stephens L, Cheney MK, Cole AB, Kezbers K, Matoska CT, Robison J, Montgomery A, Zappi CV, Businelle MS.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Dec 5;11(12):e40713. doi: 10.2196/40713.,Garey L,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/11/21,PMC9728024,,10.2196/40713,"BACKGROUND: Clear health disparities have emerged in the rates of COVID-19 exposure, hospitalization, and death among Black, Hispanic, and American Indian (BHAI) individuals, relative to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. BHAI populations have been disproportionately affected by lower behavioral health access and heightened negative mental health outcomes during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This project directly addresses health disparities in access to behavioral health care during the COVID-19 pandemic among BHAI populations via an adaptation of the established, initially validated, low-cost, mobile app Easing Anxiety Sensitivity for Everyone (EASE) among individuals with symptoms of elevated anxiety or depression or both. METHODS: The EASE trial is a 2-arm, prospective, randomized, blinded-assessor study with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants (N=800; n=200, 25%, Black; n=200, 25%, Hispanic; n=200, 25%, American Indian; and n=200, 25%, NHW) are randomized to receive either EASE or an active comparison condition for anxiety and depression. Participants compete an online prescreener, an enrollment call to provide informed consent, a baseline survey, a 6-month intervention period, and 3- and 6-month postbaseline assessments. Select participants also complete a 3- and 6-month postbaseline qualitative interview via phone or an online platform (eg, Zoom). Participants complete 2 scheduled daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) during the 6-month study period. These twice-daily EMAs guide a just-in-time approach to immediate, personalized behavioral health care. RESULTS: Outcomes include reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and functional impairment at 3 and 6 months postrandomization. We also will examine putative mechanisms (eg, anxiety sensitivity [AS] and COVID-19-specific stress and fear) of the intervention effects. Further, as treatment effects may differ across sociocultural factors, perceived discrimination, social support, and socioeconomic status (SES) will be evaluated as potential moderators of treatment effects on the primary outcomes. Process evaluation using data collected during the study, as well as individual interviews with participants, will complement quantitative data. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this efficacy trial will determine whether EASE successfully improves symptoms of anxiety and depression and whether these improvements outperform an active comparison control app. If successful, findings from this study have the potential to decrease anxiety and depression symptoms among vulnerable populations determined to be most at risk of exacerbated, long-lasting negative health sequelae. Data from this study may be used to support an implementation and dissemination trial of EASE within real-world behavioral health and social service settings.

A Bluetooth-Based Smartphone App for Detecting Peer Proximity: Protocol for Evaluating Functionality and Validity,"Barnett NP, Sokolovsky AW, Meisel MK, Forkus SR, Jackson KM.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2024 Apr 5;13:e50241. doi: 10.2196/50241.,Barnett NP,JMIR Res Protoc,2024,2024/04/05,PMC11031693,,10.2196/50241,"BACKGROUND: While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is commonly used to study social contexts and social influence in the real world, EMA almost exclusively relies on participant self-report of present circumstances, including the proximity to influential peers. There is the potential for developing a proximity sensing approach that uses small Bluetooth beacons and smartphone-based detection and data collection to collect information about interactions between individuals passively in real time. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the methods for evaluating the functionality and validity of a Bluetooth-based beacon and a smartphone app to identify when >/=2 individuals are physically proximal. METHODS: We will recruit 20 participants aged 18 to 29 years with Android smartphones to complete a 3-week study during which beacon detection and self-report data will be collected using a smartphone app (MEI Research). Using an interviewer-administered social network interview, participants will identify up to 3 peers of the same age who are influential on health behavior (alcohol use in this study). These peers will be asked to carry a Bluetooth beacon (Kontakt asset tag) for the duration of the study; each beacon has a unique ID that, when detected, will be recorded by the app on the participant's phone. Participants will be prompted to respond to EMA surveys (signal-contingent reports) when a peer beacon encounter meets our criteria and randomly 3 times daily (random reports) and every morning (morning reports) to collect information about the presence of peers. In all reports, the individualized list of peers will be presented to participants, followed by questions about peer and participant behavior, including alcohol use. Data from multiple app data sets, including beacon encounter specifications, notification, and app logs, participant EMA self-reports and postparticipation interviews, and peer surveys, will be used to evaluate project goals. We will examine the functionality of the technology, including the stability of the app (eg, app crashes and issues opening the app), beacon-to-app detection (ie, does the app detect proximal beacons?), and beacon encounter notification when encounter criteria are met. The validity of the technology will be defined as the concordance between passive detection of peers via beacon-to-app communication and the participant's EMA report of peer presence. Disagreement between the beacon and self-report data (ie, false negatives and false positives) will be investigated in multiple ways (ie, to determine if the reason was technology-related or participant compliance-related) using encounter data and information collected from participants and peers. RESULTS: Participant recruitment began in February 2023, and enrollment was completed in December 2023. Results will be reported in 2025. CONCLUSIONS: This Bluetooth-based technology has important applications and clinical implications for various health behaviors, including the potential for just-in-time adaptive interventions that target high-risk behavior in real time.

Designing and evaluating a web-based self-management site for patients with type 2 diabetes--systematic website development and study protocol,"Yu CH, Parsons J, Mamdani M, Lebovic G, Shah BR, Bhattacharyya O, Laupacis A, Straus SE.",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2012 Jun 24;12:57. doi: 10.1186/1472-6947-12-57.,Yu CH,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,2012,2012/06/26,PMC3473319,,10.1186/1472-6947-12-57,"BACKGROUND: Given that patients provide the majority of their own diabetes care, patient self-management training has increasingly become recognized as an important strategy with which to improve quality of care. However, participation in self management programs is low. In addition, the efficacy of current behavioural interventions wanes over time, reducing the impact of self-management interventions on patient health. Web-based interventions have the potential to bridge the gaps in diabetes care and self-management. METHODS: Our objective is to improve self-efficacy, quality of life, self-care, blood pressure, cholesterol and glycemic control and promote exercise in people with type 2 diabetes through the rigorous development and use of a web-based patient self-management intervention. This study consists of five phases: (1) intervention development; (2) feasibility testing; (3) usability testing; (4) intervention refinement; and (5) intervention evaluation using mixed methods. We will employ evidence-based strategies and tools, using a theoretical framework of self-efficacy, then elicit user feedback through focus groups and individual user testing sessions. Using iterative redesign the intervention will be refined. Once finalized, the impact of the website on patient self-efficacy, quality of life, self-care, HbA1c, LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure and weight will be assessed through a non-randomized observational cohort study using repeated measures modeling and individual interviews. DISCUSSION: Increasing use of the World Wide Web by consumers for health information and ongoing revolutions in social media are strong indicators that users are primed to welcome a new era of technology in health care. However, their full potential is hindered by limited knowledge regarding their effectiveness, poor usability, and high attrition rates. Our development and research agenda aims to address these limitations by improving usability, identifying characteristics associated with website use and attrition, and developing strategies to sustain patient use in order to maximize clinical outcomes."

Innovative and easily accessible interventions are lacking. Breast Cancer e-Support is a mobile Application program (App) that provides patients with individually tailored information and a support group of peers and health care professionals. Breast Cancer e-Support aims to promote women's self-efficacy, social support and symptom management, thus improving their quality of life and psychological well-being. METHODS: A single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, 6-month, parallel-group superiority design will be used. Based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and the social exchange theory, Breast Cancer e-Support has four modules: 1) a Learning forum; 2) a Discussion forum; 3) an Ask-the-Expert forum; and 4) a Personal Stories forum. Women with breast cancer (n = 108) who are commencing chemotherapy will be recruited from two university-affiliated hospitals in China. They will be randomly assigned to either control group that receives routine care or intervention group that receives routine care plus access to Breast Cancer e-Support program during their four cycles of chemotherapy. Self-efficacy, social support, symptom distress, quality of life, and anxiety and depression will be measured at baseline, then one week and 12 weeks post-intervention. DISCUSSION: This is the first study of its kind in China to evaluate the use of a mobile application intervention with a rigorous research design and theoretical framework. This study will contribute to evidence regarding the effectiveness of a theory-based mobile application to support women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The results should provide a better understanding of the role of self-efficacy and social support in reducing symptom distress and of the credibility of using a theoretical framework to develop internet-based interventions. The results will provide evidence to support the implementation of an innovative and easily accessible intervention that enhances health outcomes.

RESULTS: Using our systematic framework for the evaluation of mental health apps, we analyzed the accessibility, privacy, clinical foundation, features, and interoperability of the top-returned 100 apps for bipolar disorder. Only 56% of the apps mentioned bipolar disorder specifically in their title, description, or content. Only one app's efficacy was supported in a peer-reviewed study, and 32 apps lacked privacy policies. The most common features provided were mood tracking, journaling, and psychoeducation. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in the current digital environment for individuals seeking an evidence-based, clinically usable app for bipolar disorder. Although there have been academic advances in development of digital interventions for bipolar disorder, this work has yet to be translated to the publicly available app marketplace. This unmet need of digital mood management underscores the need for a comprehensive evaluation system of mental health apps, which we have endeavored to provide through our framework and accompanying database (apps.digitalpsych.org)."

High penetration of smartphone usage and widespread acceptance of social media applications provide an unprecedented opportunity for mobile-based health interventions (mHealth interventions) in resource-limited settings like China. The current report describes the design and sample characteristics of the Run4Love randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at improving mental health in PLWH in China. METHODS: A total of 300 PLWH with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited and randomized into either the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group received an adapted cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) course delivered by the enhanced WeChat platform (for 3 months) and were motivated to engage in physical activities. Progress of the participants was automatically tracked and monitored with timely feedback and rewards. The control group received a brochure on nutrition for PLWH in addition to standard care. The outcome assessments are conducted at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months using tablets. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms measured by the scale of the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression (CES-D). Secondary outcomes include quality of life, chronic stress measured with biomarker of hair cortisol, and other measures of stress and depression, self-efficacy, coping, HIV-related stigma, physical activity, and patient satisfaction. Mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to analyze the intervention effects. DISCUSSION: The Run4Love study is among the first efforts to develop and evaluate a multicomponent and integrated mHealth intervention to improve the mental health and quality of life of PLWH. Once proven effective, Run4Love could be scaled up and potentially integrated into the routine case management of PLWH and adapted to other populations with chronic diseases.

Self-directed digital interventions for the improvement of emotion regulation-effectiveness for mental health and functioning in adolescents: protocol for a systematic review,"Thomson A, Lawrence EG, Oliver BR, Wright B, Hosang GM.",BMJ Open. 2024 Apr 23;14(4):e081556. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2023-081556.,Thomson A,BMJ Open,2024,2024/04/24,PMC11043735,,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-081556,"INTRODUCTION: Research suggests that problems with emotion regulation, that is, how a person manages and responds to an emotional experience, are related to a range of psychological disorders (eg, bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression). Interventions targeting emotion regulation have been shown to improve mental health in adults, but evidence on related interventions for adolescents is still emerging. Increasingly, self-directed digital interventions (eg, mobile apps) are being developed to target emotion regulation in this population, but questions remain about their effectiveness. This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence on current self-directed digital interventions available to adolescents (aged 11-18 years) and their effectiveness in addressing emotion regulation, psychopathology and functioning (eg, academic achievement). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Several electronic databases will be searched (eg, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library) to identify all studies published any time after January 2010 examining self-directed digital interventions for adolescents, which include an emotion regulation component. This search will be updated periodically to identify any new relevant research from the selected databases. Data on the study characteristics (eg, author(s)) and methodology, participant characteristics (eg, age) and the digital interventions used to address emotion (dys-)regulation (eg, name, focus) will be extracted. A narrative synthesis of all studies will be presented. If feasible, the effectiveness data will be synthesised using appropriate statistical techniques. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this study. Findings will be disseminated widely via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences related to this field.

Mobile interventions (i.e., mHealth) have the potential to increase monitoring and improve coping post-acute care for this population. This protocol paper describes a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study, in which a randomized controlled trial will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of a multi-component mHealth intervention (tFOCUS) for improving outcomes for adults with SMI transitioning from acute to outpatient care. METHODS: Adults meeting criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum or major mood disorders (n = 180) will be recruited from a psychiatric hospital and randomized to treatment-as-usual (TAU) plus standard discharge planning and aftercare (CHECK-IN) or TAU plus tFOCUS. tFOCUS is a 12-week intervention, consisting of: (a) a patient-facing mHealth smartphone app with daily self-assessment prompts and targeted coping strategies; (b) a clinician-facing web dashboard; and, (c) mHealth aftercare advisors, who will conduct brief post-hospital clinical calls with patients (e.g., safety concerns, treatment engagement) and encourage app use. Follow-ups will be conducted at 6-, 12-, and 24-weeks post-discharge to assess primary and secondary outcomes, as well as target mechanisms. We also will assess barriers and facilitators to future implementation of tFOCUS via qualitative interviews of stakeholders and input from a Community Advisory Board throughout the project. CONCLUSIONS: Information gathered during this project, in combination with successful study outcomes, will inform a potential tFOCUS intervention scale-up across a range of psychiatric hospitals and healthcare systems.

App-based oral health promotion interventions on modifiable risk factors associated with early childhood caries: A systematic review,"Ajay K, Azevedo LB, Haste A, Morris AJ, Giles E, Gopu BP, Subramanian MP, Zohoori FV.",Front Oral Health. 2023 Mar 10;4:1125070. doi: 10.3389/froh.2023.1125070. eCollection 2023.,Ajay K,Front Oral Health,2023,2023/03/27,PMC10036826,,10.3389/froh.2023.1125070,"BACKGROUND: Early childhood caries (ECC) is a preventable chronic disease. Parents' knowledge and attitudes toward oral healthcare have been associated with higher caries experience in their children. Mobile apps within the context of mHealth interventions are a potential tool for raising awareness and informing parents about their children's oral health. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of mobile health apps, targeted at parents and caregivers, for the prevention of ECC. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was carried out in five scientific databases; Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Original studies, delivering oral health interventions to parents of children <6 years via smartphones, were included. Both quantitative and qualitative findings from the included studies were extracted. SYNTHESIS: A convergent segregated approach was used to integrate the quantitative and qualitative evidence, followed by side-by-side display and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Out of 5,953 retrieved articles, five met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Three articles reported quantitative findings, while two reported both quantitative and qualitative findings. Four studies reported that a mobile app can be an effective tool to improve the oral health knowledge of parents/caregivers, aiding them in incorporating good oral health habits into their children's daily routines. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated that oral health promotion programs delivered through mobile apps to parents could be effective in improving child oral health awareness among parents. There is a need for more high-quality studies with a large number of participants to find out which features of mHealth interventions with parents could effectively be employed to reduce the prevalence of ECC. Further studies and apps should be developed based on evidence-based behaviour change techniques and incorporate features such as gamification to increase the effectiveness and engagement of the target population.

Digital Phenotyping in Adults with Schizophrenia: A Narrative Review,"Lane E, D'Arcey J, Kidd S, Onyeaka H, Alon N, Joshi D, Torous J.",Curr Psychiatry Rep. 2023 Nov;25(11):699-706. doi: 10.1007/s11920-023-01467-z. Epub 2023 Oct 20.,Lane E,Curr Psychiatry Rep,2023,2023/10/20,,,10.1007/s11920-023-01467-z,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As care for older adult patients with schizophrenia lacks innovation, technology can help advance the field. Specifically, digital phenotyping, the real-time monitoring of patients' behaviors through smartphone sensors and symptoms through surveys, holds promise as the method can capture the dynamicity and environmental correlates of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Few studies have used digital phenotyping to elucidate adult patients' experiences with schizophrenia. In this narrative review, we summarized the literature using digital phenotyping on adults with schizophrenia. No study focused solely on older adult patients. Studies including all adult patients were heterogeneous in measures used, duration, and outcomes. Despite limited research, digital phenotyping shows potential for monitoring outcomes such as negative, positive, and functional symptoms, as well as predicting relapse. Future research should work to target the symptomology persistent in chronic schizophrenia and ensure all patients have the digital literacy required to benefit from digital interventions and homogenize datasets to allow for more robust conclusions."
Effectiveness and Minimum Effective Dose of App-Based Mobile Health Interventions for Anxiety and Depression Symptom Reduction: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Lu SC, Xu M, Wang M, Hardi A, Cheng AL, Chang SH, Yen PY.",JMIR Ment Health. 2022 Sep 7;9(9):e39454. doi: 10.2196/39454.,Lu SC,JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022/09/07,PMC9494214,,10.2196/39454,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer new opportunities to deliver psychological treatments for mental illness in an accessible, private format. The results of several previous systematic reviews support the use of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression symptom management. However, it remains unclear how much or how long the minimum treatment ""dose"" is for an mHealth intervention to be effective. Just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) has been introduced in the mHealth domain to facilitate behavior changes and is positioned to guide the design of mHealth interventions with enhanced adherence and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: Inspired by the JITAI framework, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the dose effectiveness of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression symptom reduction. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on 7 databases (ie, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Scopus, Cochrane Library (eg, CENTRAL), ScienceDirect, and ClinicalTrials, for publications from January 2012 to April 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression. The study selection and data extraction process followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We estimated the pooled effect size using Hedge g and appraised study quality using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs. RESULTS: We included 15 studies involving 2627 participants for 18 app-based mHealth interventions. Participants in the intervention groups showed a significant effect on anxiety (Hedge g=-.10, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.06, I2=0%) but not on depression (Hedge g=-.08, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.07, I2=4%). Interventions of at least 7 weeks' duration had larger effect sizes on anxiety symptom reduction. CONCLUSIONS: There is inconclusive evidence for clinical use of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression at the current stage due to the small to nonsignificant effects of the interventions and study quality concerns. The recommended dose of mHealth interventions and the sustainability of intervention effectiveness remain unclear and require further investigation."
Understanding the Effect of Adding Automated and Human Coaching to a Mobile Health Physical Activity App for Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of the Stay Strong Intervention,"Buis LR, McCant FA, Gierisch JM, Bastian LA, Oddone EZ, Richardson CR, Kim HM, Evans R, Hooks G, Kadri R, White-Clark C, Damschroder LJ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Jan 29;8(1):e12526. doi: 10.2196/12526.,Buis LR,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/01/30,PMC6371069,,10.2196/12526,"BACKGROUND: Although maintaining a healthy weight and physical conditioning are requirements of active military duty, many US veterans rapidly gain weight and lose conditioning when they separate from active-duty service. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions that incorporate wearables for activity monitoring have become common, but it is unclear how to optimize engagement over time. Personalized health coaching, either through tailored automated messaging or by individual health coaches, has the potential to increase the efficacy of mHealth programs. In an attempt to preserve conditioning and ward off weight gain, we developed Stay Strong, a mobile app that is tailored to veterans of recent conflicts and tracks physical activity monitored by Fitbit Charge 2 devices and weight measured on a Bluetooth-enabled scale. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to determine the effect of activity monitoring plus health coaching compared with activity monitoring alone. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, with Stay Strong, a mobile app designed specifically for veterans, we plan to enroll 350 veterans to engage in an mHealth lifestyle intervention that combines the use of a wearable physical activity tracker and a Bluetooth-enabled weight scale. The Stay Strong app displays physical activity and weight data trends over time. Enrolled participants are randomized to receive the Stay Strong app (active comparator arm) or Stay Strong + Coaching, an enhanced version of the program that adds coaching features (automated tailored messaging with weekly physical activity goals and up to 3 telephone calls with a health coach-intervention arm) for 1 year. Our primary outcome is change in physical activity at 12 months, with weight, pain, patient activation, and depression serving as secondary outcome measures. All processes related to recruitment, eligibility screening, informed consent, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act authorization, baseline assessment, randomization, the bulk of intervention delivery, and outcome assessment will be accomplished via the internet or smartphone app. RESULTS: The study recruitment began in September 2017, and data collection is expected to conclude in 2019. A total of 465 participants consented to participate and 357 (357/465, 77%) provided baseline levels of physical activity and were randomized to 1 of the 2 interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This novel randomized controlled trial will provide much-needed findings about whether the addition of telephone-based human coaching and other automated supportive-coaching features will improve physical activity compared with using a smartphone app linked to a wearable device alone.

A systematic review of mHealth interventions for HIV prevention and treatment among GBMSM was conducted to summarize the current evidence and provide recommendations for future research. PRISMA guidelines were followed (PROSPERO ID: 148452). Studies identified via PubMed, PsychInfo, or Embase were included that (i) were in English, (ii) were published in a peer-reviewed journal prior to July 1, 2019, (iii) presented primary results, (iv) included only GBMSM, and (v) reported the results of an mHealth intervention (e.g., text message, phone/mobile application [app]) to improve HIV prevention or treatment outcomes. Of 1,636 identified abstracts, 16 published studies met inclusion criteria. Eleven studies were conducted in the United States. One study was a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT), seven were single-arm pilots with pre-post assessments, four were pilot RCTs, and four tested public health campaigns with post-assessments. Seven developed study-specific apps, five used text messaging, and four used existing social networking apps. Most (81%) targeted prevention outcomes. Nine cited a specific behavioral theory. All studies found that a mHealth approach was feasible and acceptable. All interventions provided evidence of preliminary efficacy or promising trends on primary outcomes. Although mHealth interventions for HIV prevention and treatment appear feasible and acceptable, most published studies are small pilot trials. Additional research assessing the efficacy and mechanisms of mHealth interventions is needed."
A Smartphone-Based Self-management Intervention for Individuals With Bipolar Disorder (LiveWell): Protocol Development for an Expert System to Provide Adaptive User Feedback,"Goulding EH, Dopke CA, Michaels T, Martin CR, Khiani MA, Garborg C, Karr C, Begale M.",JMIR Form Res. 2021 Dec 24;5(12):e32932. doi: 10.2196/32932.,Goulding EH,JMIR Form Res,2021,2021/12/24,PMC8742209,,10.2196/32932,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness that results in significant morbidity and mortality. While pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment, adjunctive psychotherapy can improve outcomes. However, access to therapy is limited. Smartphones and other technologies can increase access to therapeutic strategies that enhance self-management while simultaneously augmenting care by providing adaptive delivery of content to users as well as alerts to providers to facilitate clinical care communication. Unfortunately, while adaptive interventions are being developed and tested to improve care, information describing the components of adaptive interventions is often not published in sufficient detail to facilitate replication and improvement of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: To contribute to and support the improvement and dissemination of technology-based mental health interventions, we provide a detailed description of the expert system for adaptively delivering content and facilitating clinical care communication for LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for individuals with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Information from empirically supported psychotherapies for bipolar disorder, health psychology behavior change theories, and chronic disease self-management models was combined with user-centered design data and psychiatrist feedback to guide the development of the expert system. RESULTS: Decision points determining the timing of intervention option adaptation were selected to occur daily and weekly based on self-report data for medication adherence, sleep duration, routine, and wellness levels. These data were selected for use as the tailoring variables determining which intervention options to deliver when and to whom. Decision rules linking delivery of options and tailoring variable thresholds were developed based on existing literature regarding bipolar disorder clinical status and psychiatrist feedback. To address the need for treatment adaptation with varying clinical statuses, decision rules for a clinical status state machine were developed using self-reported wellness rating data. Clinical status from this state machine was incorporated into hierarchal decision tables that select content for delivery to users and alerts to providers. The majority of the adaptive content addresses sleep duration, medication adherence, managing signs and symptoms, building and utilizing support, and keeping a regular routine, as well as determinants underlying engagement in these target behaviors as follows: attitudes and perceptions, knowledge, support, evaluation, and planning. However, when problems with early warning signs, symptoms, and transitions to more acute clinical states are detected, the decision rules shift the adaptive content to focus on managing signs and symptoms, and engaging with psychiatric providers. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive mental health technologies have the potential to enhance the self-management of mental health disorders. The need for individuals with bipolar disorder to engage in the management of multiple target behaviors and to address changes in clinical status highlights the importance of detailed reporting of adaptive intervention components to allow replication and improvement of adaptive mental health technologies for complex mental health problems."
mHealth and Perinatal Depression in Low-and Middle-Income Countries: A Scoping Review of the Literature,"Dosani A, Arora H, Mazmudar S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Oct 21;17(20):7679. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17207679.,Dosani A,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2020,2020/10/24,PMC7589927,,10.3390/ijerph17207679,"Women in low- and middle-income countries have high rates of perinatal depression. As smartphones become increasingly accessible around the world, there is an opportunity to explore innovative mHealth tools for the prevention, screening, and management of perinatal depression. We completed a scoping review of the literature pertaining to the use of mobile phone technologies for perinatal depression in low-and middle-income countries. PubMed CINHAL, and Google Scholar databases were searched, generating 423 results. 12 articles met our inclusion criteria. Two of the 12 articles reviewed mobile phone applications. The remaining 9 articles were study protocols or descriptive/intervention studies. Our results reveal that minimal literature is currently available on the use of mobile health for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries. We found four articles that present the results of an intervention that were delivered through mobile phones for the treatment of perinatal depressive symptoms and an additional qualitative study describing the perceptions of mothers receiving cognitive behavioral therapy via telephones. These studies demonstrated that depressive symptoms improved after the interventions. There is potential to improve the quality of mHealth interventions, specifically mobile phone applications for perinatal depressive symptoms and depression, through meaningful collaborative work between healthcare professionals and application developers."
Digital Phenotyping Data to Predict Symptom Improvement and App Personalization: Protocol for a Prospective Study,"Currey D, Torous J.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Nov 29;11(11):e37954. doi: 10.2196/37954.,Currey D,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/11/29,PMC9748794,,10.2196/37954,"BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps that capture surveys and sensors are increasingly being leveraged to collect data on clinical conditions. In mental health, this data could be used to personalize psychiatric support offered by apps so that they are more effective and engaging. Yet today, few mental health apps offer this type of support, often because of challenges associated with accurately predicting users' actual future mental health. OBJECTIVE: In this protocol, we present a study design to explore engagement with mental health apps in college students, using the Technology Acceptance Model as a theoretical framework, and assess the accuracy of predicting mental health changes using digital phenotyping data. METHODS: There are two main goals of this study. First, we present a logistic regression model fit on data from a prior study on college students and prospectively test this model on a new student cohort to assess its accuracy. Second, we will provide users with data-driven activity suggestions every 4 days to determine whether this type of personalization will increase engagement or attitudes toward the app compared to those receiving no personalized recommendations. RESULTS: The study was completed in the spring of 2022, and the manuscript is currently in review at JMIR Publications. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first digital phenotyping algorithms to be prospectively validated. Overall, our results will inform the potential of digital phenotyping data to serve as tailoring data in adaptive interventions and to increase rates of engagement.

Moderated online social therapy for carers of young people recovering from first-episode psychosis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Gleeson J, Lederman R, Herrman H, Koval P, Eleftheriadis D, Bendall S, Cotton SM, Alvarez-Jimenez M.",Trials. 2017 Jan 17;18(1):27. doi: 10.1186/s13063-016-1775-5.,Gleeson J,Trials,2017,2017/01/19,PMC5240433,,10.1186/s13063-016-1775-5,"BACKGROUND: First-episode psychosis most often has its onset during late adolescence. In caring for the young person, families endure high levels of stress and depression. Meanwhile, the social networks of families often erode. Our group has previously shown that family cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) leads to significantly improved perceived stress compared with specialist first-episode treatment as usual; however, there are well-known barriers to the dissemination of effective family interventions. To address this, we have developed a novel online intervention entitled 'Altitudes' that fully integrates purpose-built online social networking, expert and peer moderation, and evidence-based psychoeducation within a single application. The primary aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of Altitudes in reducing stress in carers over a 6-month period. METHODS/DESIGN: We describe here a single-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with permutated blocks. The clusters comprise individual families. The two treatment conditions include Altitudes plus Specialist Treatment as Usual (STAU) and STAU alone. Altitudes involves participation in our novel online programme whereas STAU comprises specialist family work at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC), Melbourne, Australia. We aim to recruit 160 family members of young, 15-27 year-old, patients registered for treatment for first-episode psychosis (FEP) at EPPIC. The design includes two assessment time points, namely, baseline and 6-month follow-up. The study is due for completion within 2 years including an 18-month recruitment period and a 6-month treatment phase. The primary outcome is carers' perceived stress at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures include a biomarker of stress, depressive symptoms, worry, substance use, loneliness, social support, satisfaction with life, and a range of measures that tap into coping resources. We seek to gain a dynamic picture of carer stress through our Smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment (SEMA) tool. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate an online intervention for carers of young people recovering from FEP. It has the potential to produce evidence in support of a highly novel, accessible, and cost-effective intervention to reduce stress in carers who are providing support to young people at a critical phase in their recovery from psychosis.

Efficacy and Conflicts of Interest in Randomized Controlled Trials Evaluating Headspace and Calm Apps: Systematic Review,"O'Daffer A, Colt SF, Wasil AR, Lau N.",JMIR Ment Health. 2022 Sep 20;9(9):e40924. doi: 10.2196/40924.,O'Daffer A,JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022/09/20,PMC9533203,,10.2196/40924,"BACKGROUND: Although there are thousands of mental health apps, 2 apps, Headspace and Calm, claim a large percentage of the marketplace. These two mindfulness and meditation apps have reached tens of millions of active users. To guide consumers, clinicians, and researchers, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Headspace and Calm. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate intervention efficacy, risk of bias, and conflicts of interest (COIs) in the evidence base for Headspace and Calm, the two most popular mental health apps at the time of our search. METHODS: To identify studies, we searched academic databases (Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) and the websites of Headspace and Calm in May 2021 for RCTs of Headspace and Calm testing efficacy via original data collection, published in English in peer-reviewed journals. For each study, we coded (1) study characteristics (eg, participants, sample size, and outcome measures), (2) intervention characteristics (eg, free vs paid version of the app and intended frequency of app usage), (3) all study outcomes, (4) Cochrane risk of bias variables, and (5) COI variables (eg, presence or absence of a preregistration and the presence or absence of a COI statement involving the company). RESULTS: We identified 14 RCTs of Headspace and 1 RCT of Calm. Overall, 93% (13/14) of RCTs of Headspace and 100% (1/1) of RCTs of Calm recruited participants from a nonclinical population. Studies commonly measured mindfulness, well-being, stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Headspace use improved depression in 75% of studies that evaluated it as an outcome. Findings were mixed for mindfulness, well-being, stress, and anxiety, but at least 40% of studies showed improvement for each of these outcomes. Studies were generally underpowered to detect ""small"" or ""medium"" effect sizes. Furthermore, 50% (7/14) of RCTs of Headspace and 0% (0/1) of RCTs of Calm reported a COI that involved Headspace or Calm (the companies). The most common COI was the app company providing premium app access for free for participants, and notably, 14% (2/14) of RCTs of Headspace reported Headspace employee involvement in study design, execution, and data analysis. Only 36% (5/14) of RCTs of Headspace were preregistered, and the 1 RCT of Calm was not preregistered. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical research on Headspace appears promising, whereas there is an absence of randomized trials on Calm. Limitations of this study include an inability to compare Headspace and Calm owing to the dearth of RCTs studying Calm and the reliance on author reports to evaluate COIs. When determining whether or not mental health apps are of high quality, identification of high-quality apps and evaluation of their effectiveness and investigators' COIs should be ensured."
The Nourish Protocol: A digital health randomized controlled trial to promote the DASH eating pattern among adults with hypertension,"Miller HN, Berger MB, Askew S, Kay MC, Hopkins CM, Iragavarapu MS, de Leon M, Freed M, Barnes CN, Yang Q, Tyson CC, Svetkey LP, Bennett GG, Steinberg DM.",Contemp Clin Trials. 2021 Oct;109:106539. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2021.106539.

The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating pattern is an evidence-based first-line treatment option for hypertension; however, adherence to the DASH eating pattern at a population level remains low. To address this gap, we will implement Nourish, a randomized controlled efficacy trial that will leverage a commercially-available smartphone application and evidence-based behavior change principles to improve adherence to the DASH eating pattern among adults with hypertension. METHODS: The Nourish trial is a two-arm, 12-month randomized control trial that will enroll adults (N = 300) with hypertension, defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120-159 mmHg; a diastolic blood pressure of 80-99 mmHg; and/or adults on blood pressure-lowering medication. Nourish will test the efficacy of a digital health intervention, as compared to the attention control arm, on DASH eating pattern adherence and blood pressure. Intervention components will include skills training, self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and responsive coaching. The primary outcome of the trial is 6-month changes in adherence to the DASH eating pattern, as measured by 24-h dietary recalls. DISCUSSION: Millions of Americans remain in need of effective behavioral interventions to manage and improve their hypertension and its adverse consequences. The ubiquity of smartphones offers a promising approach to disseminate the DASH eating pattern. By leveraging these widely used smartphone applications, combined with evidence-based behavior change principles and the DASH eating plan, Nourish will demonstrate the effectiveness of a digital health intervention to improve DASH adherence, and ultimately, to reduce blood pressure.

A systematic review of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) to promote physical activity,"Hardeman W, Houghton J, Lane K, Jones A, Naughton F.",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2019 Apr 3;16(1):31. doi: 10.1186/s12966-019-0792-7.,Hardeman W,Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,2019,2019/04/05,PMC6448257,,10.1186/s12966-019-0792-7,"BACKGROUND: Progress in mobile health (mHealth) technology has enabled the design of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). We define JITAIs as having three features: behavioural support that directly corresponds to a need in real-time; content or timing of support is adapted or tailored according to input collected by the system since support was initiated; support is system-triggered. We conducted a systematic review of JITAIs for physical activity to identify their features, feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness. METHODS: We searched Scopus, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov and the ISRCTN register using terms related to physical activity, mHealth interventions and JITAIs. We included primary studies of any design reporting data about JITAIs, irrespective of population, age and setting. Outcomes included physical activity, engagement, uptake, feasibility and acceptability. Paper screening and data extraction were independently validated. Synthesis was narrative. We used the mHealth Evidence Reporting and Assessment checklist to assess quality of intervention descriptions. RESULTS: We screened 2200 titles, 840 abstracts, 169 full-text papers, and included 19 papers reporting 14 unique JITAIs, including six randomised studies. Five JITAIs targeted both physical activity and sedentary behaviour, five sedentary behaviour only, and four physical activity only. JITAIs prompted breaks following sedentary periods and/or suggested physical activities during opportunistic moments, typically over three to four weeks. Feasibility challenges related to the technology, sensor reliability and timeliness of just-in-time messages. Overall, participants found JITAIs acceptable. We found mixed evidence for intervention effects on behaviour, but no study was sufficiently powered to detect any effects. Common behaviour change techniques were goal setting (behaviour), prompts/cues, feedback on behaviour and action planning. Five studies reported a theory-base. We found lack of evidence about cost-effectiveness, uptake, reach, impact on health inequalities, and sustained engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Research into JITAIs to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour is in its early stages. Consistent use and a shared definition of the term 'JITAI' will aid evidence synthesis. We recommend robust evaluation of theory and evidence-based JITAIs in representative populations. Decision makers and health professionals need to be cautious in signposting patients to JITAIs until such evidence is available, although they are unlikely to cause health-related harm.

"A Smartphone-Based Self-management Intervention for Individuals With Bipolar Disorder (LiveWell): Empirical and Theoretical Framework, Intervention Design, and Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Goulding EH, Dopke CA, Rossom RC, Michaels T, Martin CR, Ryan C, Jonathan G, McBride A, Babington P, Bernstein M, Bank A, Garborg CS, Dinh JM, Begale M, Kwasny MJ, Mohr DC.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Feb 21;11(2):e30710. doi: 10.2196/30710.,Goulding EH,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/02/21,PMC8902672,,10.2196/30710,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness with high morbidity and mortality rates. Even with pharmacological treatment, frequent recurrence of episodes, long episode durations, and persistent interepisode symptoms are common and disruptive. Combining psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy improves outcomes; however, many individuals with bipolar disorder do not receive psychotherapy. Mental health technologies can increase access to self-management strategies derived from empirically supported bipolar disorder psychotherapies while also enhancing treatment by delivering real-time assessments, personalized feedback, and provider alerts. In addition, mental health technologies provide a platform for self-report, app use, and behavioral data collection to advance understanding of the longitudinal course of bipolar disorder, which can then be used to support ongoing improvement of treatment. OBJECTIVE: A description of the theoretical and empirically supported framework, design, and protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of LiveWell, a smartphone-based self-management intervention for individuals with bipolar disorder, is provided to facilitate the ability to replicate, improve, implement, and disseminate effective interventions for bipolar disorder. The goal of the trial is to determine the effectiveness of LiveWell for reducing relapse risk and symptom burden as well as improving quality of life (QOL) while simultaneously clarifying behavioral targets involved in staying well and better characterizing the course of bipolar disorder and treatment response. METHODS: The study is a single-blind RCT (n=205; 2:3 ratio of usual care vs usual care plus LiveWell). The primary outcome is the time to relapse. Secondary outcomes are percentage time symptomatic, symptom severity, and QOL. Longitudinal changes in target behaviors proposed to mediate the primary and secondary outcomes will also be determined, and their relationships with the outcomes will be assessed. A database of clinical status, symptom severity, real-time self-report, behavioral sensor, app use, and personalized content will be created to better predict treatment response and relapse risk. RESULTS: Recruitment and screening began in March 2017 and ended in April 2019. Follow-up ended in April 2020. The results of this study are expected to be published in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will examine whether LiveWell reduces relapse risk and symptom burden and improves QOL for individuals with bipolar disorder by increasing access to empirically supported self-management strategies. The role of selected target behaviors (medication adherence, sleep duration, routine, and management of signs and symptoms) in these outcomes will also be examined. Simultaneously, a database will be created to initiate the development of algorithms to personalize and improve treatment for bipolar disorder. In addition, we hope that this description of the theoretical and empirically supported framework, intervention design, and study protocol for the RCT of LiveWell will facilitate the ability to replicate, improve, implement, and disseminate effective interventions for bipolar and other mental health disorders.

Adapting and Scaling a Digital Health Intervention to Improve Maternal and Child Health Among Ethnic Minority Women in Vietnam Amid the COVID-19 Context: Protocol for the dMOM Project,"McBride B, O'Neil J, Nguyen PC, Linh DT, Trinh HT, Vu NC, Nguyen LT.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Apr 24;12:e44720. doi: 10.2196/44720.,McBride B,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/04/14,PMC10167587,,10.2196/44720,"BACKGROUND: Due to interconnected structural determinants including low maternal health knowledge, economic marginalization, and remoteness from low-capacity health centers, ethnic minority women in remote areas of Vietnam face severe maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) inequities. As ethnic minorities represent 15% of the Vietnamese population, these disparities are significant. mMOM-a pilot mobile health (mHealth) intervention using SMS text messaging to improve MNCH outcomes among ethnic minority women in northern Vietnam-was implemented from 2013-2016 with promising results. Despite mMOM's findings, exacerbated MNCH inequities, and digital health becoming more salient amid COVID-19, mHealth has not yet been scaled to address MNCH among ethnic minority women in Vietnam. OBJECTIVE: We describe the protocol for adapting, expanding, and exponentially scaling the mMOM intervention qualitatively through adding COVID-19-related MNCH guidance and novel technological components (mobile app and artificial intelligence chatbots) and quantitatively through broadening the geographical area to reach exponentially more participants, within the evolving COVID-19 context. METHODS: dMOM will be conducted in 4 phases. (1) Drawing on a review of international literature and government guidelines on MNCH amid COVID-19, mMOM project components will be updated to respond to COVID-19 and expanded to include a mobile app and artificial intelligence chatbots to more deeply engage participants. (2) Using an intersectionality lens and participatory action research approach, a scoping study and rapid ethnographic fieldwork will explore ethnic minority women's unmet MNCH needs; acceptability and accessibility of digital health; technical capacity of commune health centers; gendered power dynamics and cultural, geographical, and social determinants impacting health outcomes; and multilevel impacts of COVID-19. Findings will be applied to further refine the intervention. (3) dMOM will be implemented and incrementally scaled across 71 project communes. (4) dMOM will be evaluated to assess whether SMS text messaging or mobile app delivery engenders better MNCH outcomes among ethnic minority women. The documentation of lessons learned and dMOM models will be shared with Vietnam's Ministry of Health for adoption and further scaling up. RESULTS: The dMOM study was funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in November 2021, cofacilitated by the Ministry of Health, and is being coimplemented by provincial health departments in 2 mountainous provinces. Phase 1 was initiated in May 2022, and phase 2 is planned to begin in December 2022. The study is expected to be complete in June 2025. CONCLUSIONS: dMOM research outcomes will generate important empirical evidence on the effectiveness of leveraging digital health to address intractable MNCH inequities among ethnic minority women in low-resource settings in Vietnam and provide critical information on the processes of adapting mHealth interventions to respond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Finally, dMOM activities, models, and findings will inform a national intervention led by the Ministry of Health. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/44720."
Combining Behavioral Economics-Based Incentives With the Anchoring Strategy: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Stecher C, Cloonan S, Linnemayr S, Huberty J.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Apr 28;12:e39930. doi: 10.2196/39930.,Stecher C,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/04/28,PMC10182474,,10.2196/39930,"BACKGROUND: Chronic (ie, long-term) elevated stress is associated with a number of mental and physical health conditions. Mindfulness meditation mobile apps are a promising tool for stress self-management that can overcome several barriers associated with in-person interventions; however, to date, poor app-based intervention adherence has limited the efficacy of these mobile health tools. Anchoring, or pairing, a new behavior with an existing routine has been shown to effectively establish habits that are maintained over time, but this strategy typically only works for those with high initial motivation and has yet to be tested for maintaining meditation with a mobile app. OBJECTIVE: This study will test novel combinations of behavioral economics-based incentives with the anchoring strategy for establishing and maintaining adherence to an effective dose of meditation with a mobile app. METHODS: This 16-week study will use a 5-arm, parallel, partially blinded (participants only), randomized controlled design. We will implement a fractional factorial study design that varies the use of self-monitoring messages and financial incentives to support participants' use of their personalized anchoring strategy for maintaining adherence to a >/=10 minute-per-day meditation prescription during an 8-week intervention period, followed by an 8-week postintervention observation period. Specifically, we will vary the use of self-monitoring messages of either the target behavior (ie, meditation tracking) or the outcome associated with the target behavior (ie, mood symptom tracking). We will also vary the use of financial incentives conditional on either meditation at any time of day or meditation performed at approximately the same time of day as participants' personalized anchors. RESULTS: Continuous meditation app use data will be used to measure weekly meditation adherence over the 16-week study period as a binary variable equal to 1 if participants complete >/=10 minutes of meditation for >/=4 days per week and 0 otherwise. We will measure weekly anchoring plan adherence as a binary variable equal to 1 if participants complete >/=10 minutes of meditation within +1 or -1 hour of the timing of their chosen anchor on >/=4 days per week and 0 otherwise. In addition to these primary measures of meditation and anchoring plan adherence, we will also assess the secondary measures of stress, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep disturbance, and meditation app habit strength at baseline, week 8, and week 16. CONCLUSIONS: This study will fill an important gap in the mobile health literature by testing novel intervention approaches for establishing and maintaining adherence to app-based mindfulness meditation. If successful, this study will identify an accessible and scalable stress self-management intervention that can help combat stress in the United States.

Digital health interventions are a double-edged sword: they have the potential to reduce health inequalities, for example, by making treatments available remotely to rural populations underserved by health care facilities or by helping to overcome language barriers via in-app translation services; however, if not designed and deployed with care, digital health interventions also have the potential to increase health inequalities and exacerbate the effects of the digital divide. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to review ways to mitigate the digital divide through digital health intervention design, deployment, and engagement mechanisms sensitive to the needs of digitally excluded populations. METHODS: This protocol outlines the procedure for a systematic scoping review that follows the methodology recommended by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidance. The following databases will be searched for primary research studies published in English from October 1, 2011, to October 1, 2021: Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, NICE Evidence, PROSPERO, PubMed (with MEDLINE and Europe PMC), and Trip. In addition, the following sources of gray literature will be searched: Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Health Management Information Consortium, International HTA Database, OpenGrey, The Grey Literature Report, Google Scholar Basic Search UK, MedNar Deep Web Search Engine, and Carrot2. We will select publications that meet the following inclusion criteria: primary research papers that evaluated digital health interventions that describe features of digital health intervention design and deployment that enable or hinder access to and engagement with digital health interventions by adults from demographic groups likely to be affected by the digital divide (eg, older age, minority ethnic groups, lower income, and lower education level). A random selection of 25 publications identified from the search will be double screened by four reviewers. If there is >75% agreement for included/excluded publications, the team will continue to screen all the identified publications. For all included publications, study characteristics will be extracted by one author and checked for agreement by a second author, with any disagreements resolved by consensus among the study team. Consultation digital health intervention design and deployment, and digital health intervention users will also be conducted in parallel. RESULTS: The review is underway and is anticipated to be completed by September 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The results will have implications for researchers and policy makers using digital health interventions for health improvement peripandemic and post pandemic, and will inform best practices in the design and delivery of digital health interventions.

Design Principles in mHealth Interventions for Sustainable Health Behavior Changes: Protocol for a Systematic Review,"Yang L, Kuang A, Xu C, Shewchuk B, Singh S, Quan H, Zeng Y.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Feb 22;12:e39093. doi: 10.2196/39093.,Yang L,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/02/22,PMC9996417,,10.2196/39093,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, mHealth has increasingly been used to deliver behavioral interventions for disease prevention and self-management. Computing power in mHealth tools can provide unique functions beyond conventional interventions in provisioning personalized behavior change recommendations and delivering them in real time, supported by dialogue systems. However, design principles to incorporate these features in mHealth interventions have not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review is to identify best practices for the design of mHealth interventions targeting diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. We aim to identify and summarize the design characteristics of current mHealth tools with a focus on the following features: (1) personalization, (2) real-time functions, and (3) deliverable resources. METHODS: We will conduct a systematic search of electronic databases, including MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for studies published since 2010. First, we will use keywords that combine mHealth, interventions, chronic disease prevention, and self-management. Second, we will use keywords that cover diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Literature found in the first and second steps will be combined. Finally, we will use keywords for personalization and real-time functions to limit the results to interventions that have reported these design features. We expect to perform narrative syntheses for each of the 3 target design features. Study quality will be evaluated using the Risk of Bias 2 assessment tool. RESULTS: We have conducted a preliminary search of existing systematic reviews and review protocols on mHealth-supported behavior change interventions. We have identified several reviews that aimed to evaluate the efficacy of mHealth behavior change interventions in a range of populations, evaluate methodologies for assessing mHealth behavior change randomized trials, and assess the diversity of behavior change techniques and theories in mHealth interventions. However, syntheses on the unique features of mHealth intervention design are absent in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will provide a basis for developing best practices for designing mHealth tools for sustainable behavior change.

A Mobile App for Chronic Disease Self-Management: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Ownby RL, Acevedo A, Waldrop-Valverde D, Caballero J, Simonson M, Davenport R, Kondwani K, Jacobs RJ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2017 Apr 5;6(4):e53. doi: 10.2196/resprot.7272.,Ownby RL,JMIR Res Protoc,2017,2017/04/07,PMC5399224,,10.2196/resprot.7272,"BACKGROUND: Health literacy is a critically important skill that helps people become active participants in their health care. Multiple studies in the United States and across the world have documented the association of health literacy with multiple health outcomes. In particular, the elderly and many members of minority groups have been shown to have low levels of health literacy; the same groups are disproportionately affected by chronic illnesses. These twin burdens affect the people most in need of the skills and knowledge required for coping with chronic illnesses. Chronic disease self-management (CDSM) is a logical target for a general health literacy intervention. In an approach that spans across specific diseases, CDSM targets problems and skills needed to cope with issues such as fatigue, pain, stress, depression, sleep disturbance, and treatment adherence. In a previous study, we showed that a computer-delivered tailored information intervention targeting health literacy could improve treatment and adherence and be cost effective, but it is not clear that this same strategy will be effective in persons with low health literacy and multiple chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-delivered mobile intervention that will provide individuals with chronic conditions the necessary information to cope with their conditions. METHODS: In this project, we will complete a qualitative study on the status and needs of individuals with more than one chronic condition. Results of this study will be used to develop a mobile tailored information app that will address self-management challenges in the areas of pain, sleep, fatigue, depression, anger, stress, memory problems, and treatment adherence. The impact of the intervention on patient quality of life, patient-provider relationships, health literacy, and patient activation will be assessed. We will also explore the extent to which health literacy mediates important outcomes, such as health-related quality of life and health service utilization. RESULTS: We are currently completing the preliminary qualitative and usability studies that will inform the content and design of the intervention. We anticipate that the intervention will be complete in 2017, and the clinical trial of its efficacy will also commence in 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Results will provide evidence on the usefulness of a mobile tailored information app for improving health literacy, patient activation, health-related quality of life, and self-reported health in patients with multiple chronic conditions.

An mHealth App to Promote Adherence to Immunosuppressant Medication and Track Symptoms in Children After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Usability Study,"Skeens M, Sezgin E, Stevens J, Landier W, Pai A, Gerhardt C.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Jul 21;11(7):e39098. doi: 10.2196/39098.,Skeens M,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/07/21,PMC9353681,,10.2196/39098,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, poor adherence accounts for up to 70% of all medication-related hospital admissions, resulting in $100 billion in health care costs annually. In pediatrics, adherence is largely dependent on caregivers. In a high-risk hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) population, caregivers are isolated with their child due to infection risk and must manage challenging treatment regimens at home, often with limited time and support. Complex behavioral interventions, typically employed to address adherence, are difficult to deliver and manage in the context of these daily tasks. The most successful adherence interventions, and thus improved clinical outcomes, have included mobile health (mHealth) reminder approaches and a direct measure of adherence. OBJECTIVE: This is a 3-phase project, with this protocol describing phase 2, to determine the usability and feasibility of an mHealth app (BMT4me) designed to promote adherence to immunosuppressant medication and to track symptoms among children who received HSCT. METHODS: This study uses an iterative convergent mixed methods design to develop and assess the usability and feasibility of an adherence digital health intervention. We will recruit 15 caregivers of pediatric patients receiving HSCT to complete user testing. Qualitative and quantitative data will be integrated to enhance and expand upon study findings. RESULTS: Enrollment began in September 2021 and is ongoing. A total of 7 caregivers have enrolled. We anticipate completion by fall 2022. We anticipate high usability scores and a better understanding of unique features within the app that are needed for HSCT families post transplant. To date, usability scores among enrolled participants are greater than 70%. Feedback from qualitative interviews is being used to further adapt the app by adding specific weekly logs, call provider options, and voice to text. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol describes a mixed methods usability and feasibility study to develop and implement a smartphone app for caregivers of children receiving HSCT. The app was designed to improve immunosuppressant adherence and to track symptoms in the acute phase post discharge. Study findings will inform further refinement of the app and the feasibility of a pilot randomized controlled trial examining efficacy on clinical outcomes.

Effectiveness of mobile technologies delivering Ecological Momentary Interventions for stress and anxiety: a systematic review,"Loo Gee B, Griffiths KM, Gulliver A.",J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2016 Jan;23(1):221-9. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocv043. Epub 2015 May 21.,Loo Gee B,J Am Med Inform Assoc,2016,2015/05/23,PMC7814930,,10.1093/jamia/ocv043,"OBJECTIVES: Mobile technologies may be suitable for delivering Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) to treat anxiety in real-time. This review aims to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of EMI for treating anxiety conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four databases and the reference lists of previous studies were searched. A total of 1949 abstracts were double screened for inclusion. Sufficient studies were available to undertake a quantitative meta-analysis on EMIs on generalized anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: The 15 randomized trials and randomized controlled trials examined anxiety (n = 7), stress (n = 3), anxiety and stress (n = 2), panic disorder (n = 2), and social phobia (n = 1). Eight EMIs comprised self-monitoring integrated with therapy modules, seven comprised multimedia content, and three comprised self-monitoring only. The quality of studies presented high risk of biases. Meta-analysis (n = 7) demonstrated that EMIs reduced generalized anxiety compared to control and/or comparison groups (Effect Size (ES) = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.12-0.53). Most EMIs targeting stress were reported effective relative to control as were the two EMIs targeting panic disorders. The EMI targeting social phobia was not effective. DISCUSSION: EMIs have potential in treating both anxiety and stress. However, few high-quality trials have been conducted for specific anxiety disorders. Further trials are needed to assess the value of EMI technologies for anxiety in enhancing existing treatments. CONCLUSION: This study found a small significant effect of EMI studies on reducing generalized anxiety. Studies on stress demonstrated EMI was effective compared to control, with the small number of studies on panic and social phobia demonstrating mixed results."
A Library of Analytic Indicators to Evaluate Effective Engagement with Consumer mHealth Apps for Chronic Conditions: Scoping Review,"Pham Q, Graham G, Carrion C, Morita PP, Seto E, Stinson JN, Cafazzo JA.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Jan 18;7(1):e11941. doi: 10.2196/11941.,Pham Q,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/01/22,PMC6356188,,10.2196/11941,"BACKGROUND: There is mixed evidence to support current ambitions for mobile health (mHealth) apps to improve chronic health and well-being. One proposed explanation for this variable effect is that users do not engage with apps as intended. The application of analytics, defined as the use of data to generate new insights, is an emerging approach to study and interpret engagement with mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to consolidate how analytic indicators of engagement have previously been applied across clinical and technological contexts, to inform how they might be optimally applied in future evaluations. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to catalog the range of analytic indicators being used in evaluations of consumer mHealth apps for chronic conditions. We categorized studies according to app structure and application of engagement data and calculated descriptive data for each category. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests of independence were applied to calculate differences between coded variables. RESULTS: A total of 41 studies met our inclusion criteria. The average mHealth evaluation included for review was a two-group pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial of a hybrid-structured app for mental health self-management, had 103 participants, lasted 5 months, did not provide access to health care provider services, measured 3 analytic indicators of engagement, segmented users based on engagement data, applied engagement data for descriptive analyses, and did not report on attrition. Across the reviewed studies, engagement was measured using the following 7 analytic indicators: the number of measures recorded (76%, 31/41), the frequency of interactions logged (73%, 30/41), the number of features accessed (49%, 20/41), the number of log-ins or sessions logged (46%, 19/41), the number of modules or lessons started or completed (29%, 12/41), time spent engaging with the app (27%, 11/41), and the number or content of pages accessed (17%, 7/41). Engagement with unstructured apps was mostly measured by the number of features accessed (8/10, P=.04), and engagement with hybrid apps was mostly measured by the number of measures recorded (21/24, P=.03). A total of 24 studies presented, described, or summarized the data generated from applying analytic indicators to measure engagement. The remaining 17 studies used or planned to use these data to infer a relationship between engagement patterns and intended outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although researchers measured on average 3 indicators in a single study, the majority reported findings descriptively and did not further investigate how engagement with an app contributed to its impact on health and well-being. Researchers are gaining nuanced insights into engagement but are not yet characterizing effective engagement for improved outcomes. Raising the standard of mHealth app efficacy through measuring analytic indicators of engagement may enable greater confidence in the causal impact of apps on improved chronic health and well-being."
Preventing Cardiovascular Disease Among Urban African Americans With a Mobile Health App (the MOYO App): Protocol for a Usability Study,"Taylor HA Jr, Francis S, Evans CR, Harvey M, Newton BA, Jones CP, Akintobi TH, Clifford G.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Jul 9;9(7):e16699. doi: 10.2196/16699.,Taylor HA Jr,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/07/17,PMC7380980,,10.2196/16699,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are a particularly devastating manifestation of health inequity. Despite advancements in prevention and treatment, CVD is still the leading cause of death in the United States. Additionally, research indicates that African American (AA) and other ethnic-minority populations are affected by CVD at earlier ages than white Americans. Given that AAs are the fastest-growing population of smartphone owners and users, mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer the unparalleled potential to prevent or improve self-management of chronic disease among this population. OBJECTIVE: To address the unmet need for culturally tailored primordial prevention CVD-focused mHealth interventions, the MOYO app was cocreated with the involvement of young people from this priority community. The overall project aims to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a novel smartphone app designed to reduce CVD risk factors among urban-AAs, 18-29 years of age. METHODS: The theoretical underpinning will combine the principles of community-based participatory research and the agile software development framework. The primary outcome goals of the study will be to determine the usability, acceptability, and functionality of the MOYO app, and to build a cloud-based data collection infrastructure suitable for digital epidemiology in a disparity population. Changes in health-related parameters over a 24-week period as determined by both passive (eg, physical activity levels, sleep duration, social networking) and active (eg, use of mood measures, surveys, uploading pictures of meals and blood pressure readings) measures will be the secondary outcome. Participants will be recruited from a majority AA ""large city"" school district, 2 historically black colleges or universities, and 1 urban undergraduate college. Following baseline screening for inclusion (administered in person), participants will receive the beta version of the MOYO app. Participants will be monitored during a 24-week pilot period. Analyses of varying data including social network dynamics, standard metrics of activity, percentage of time away from a given radius of home, circadian rhythm metrics, and proxies for sleep will be performed. Together with external variables (eg, weather, pollution, and socioeconomic indicators such as food access), these metrics will be used to train machine-learning frameworks to regress them on the self-reported quality of life indicators. RESULTS: This 5-year study (2015-2020) is currently in the implementation phase. We believe that MOYO can build upon findings of classical epidemiology and longitudinal studies like the Jackson Heart Study by adding greater granularity to our knowledge of the exposures and behaviors that affect health and disease, and creating a channel for outreach capable of launching interventions, clinical trials, and enhancements of health literacy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot will provide valuable information about community cocreation of mHealth programs, efficacious design features, and essential infrastructure for digital epidemiology among young AA adults.

At the same time, they have been associated with risks such as unsafe sexual behavior and privacy concerns in young adults. This paper presents a study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-led web-based intervention to promote its safe usage in young adults. METHODS: The study design is an open-labeled cluster RCT with an intervention and a placebo control arm. The intervention group will receive a web-based intervention developed through focus group discussions, a crowdsourcing contest, and a Peer-Vetted Creative Production (PVCP) workshop. The control group will receive a web-based resource on health and exercise. We aim to recruit approximately 338 young adults aged 17-27 years from three tertiary educational institutions in Hong Kong with the class as the cluster unit. Based on the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) model, the primary outcome of this study is self-efficacy in using dating applications measured by the General Self Efficacy Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in risk perception measured by the Risk Propensity Scale and a Risk Assessment Tool. Questionnaires will be administered before the intervention, after the intervention, and at one-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis and multilevel regression modeling will be used to evaluate differences in outcomes between groups and the factors affecting these outcomes, respectively. DISCUSSION: Dating application usage presents opportunities as well as challenges to young adults meeting new friends. Innovative and relatable interventions are needed to promote the safe usage of dating applications to this population. Practical knowledge gained from the development process may be helpful for future intervention utilizing the peer-led approach. If effective, the intervention will be disseminated to non-governmental organizations and educational institutions to be used as a teaching resource.

At the same time, digital health technologies (DHTs), which include mobile health apps (mHealth) have been rapidly gaining popularity in the self-management of chronic diseases, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, while a great variety of DM-specific mHealth apps exist on the market, the evidence supporting their clinical effectiveness is still limited. METHODS: A systematic review was performed. A systematic search was conducted in a major electronic database to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth interventions in DM published between June 2010 and June 2020. The studies were categorized by the type of DM and impact of DM-specific mHealth apps on the management of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was analysed. RESULTS: In total, 25 studies comprising 3,360 patients were included. The methodological quality of included trials was mixed. Overall, participants diagnosed with T1DM, T2DM and Prediabetes all demonstrated greater improvements in HbA1c as a result of using a DHT compared with those who experienced usual care. The analysis revealed an overall improvement in HbA1c compared with usual care, with a mean difference of -0.56% for T1DM, -0.90% for T2DM and -0.26% for Prediabetes. CONCLUSION: DM-specific mHealth apps may reduce HbA1c levels in patients with T1DM, T2DM and Prediabetes. The review highlights a need for further research on the wider clinical effectiveness of diabetes-specific mHealth specifically within T1DM and Prediabetes. These should include measures which go beyond HbA1c, capturing outcomes including short-term glycemic variability or hypoglycemic events."

The increasing expansion of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in patient communication, the reduction of health inequalities, improved access to health care resources, adherence to treatment, and self-care of chronic diseases all point to an optimistic outlook. However, only few mobile apps demonstrate their effectiveness in these patients, which is diminished when they are not based on evidence, or when they are not designed by and for users with different levels of health literacy (HL). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an mHealth intervention relative to routine clinical practice in improving HL and self-management in patients with multimorbidity with heart failure (HF) and complex health needs. METHODS: This is a randomized, multicenter, blinded clinical trial evaluating 2 groups, namely, a control group (standard clinical practice) and an intervention group (standard clinical practice and an ad hoc designed mHealth intervention previously developed), for 12 months. RESULTS: The contents of the mHealth intervention will address user-perceived needs based on the development of user stories regarding diet, physical exercise, cardiac rehabilitation, therapeutic adherence, warning signs and symptoms, and emotional management. These contents have been validated by expert consensus. The creation and development of the contents of the mHealth intervention (app) took 18 months and was completed during 2021. The mobile app is expected to be developed by the end of 2022, after which it will be applied to the experimental group as an adjunct to standard clinical care during 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The trial will demonstrate whether the mobile app improves HL and self-management in patients with HF and complex health needs, improves therapeutic adherence, and reduces hospital admissions. This study can serve as a starting point for developing other mHealth tools in other pathologies and for their generalization to other contexts.

Efficacy of a hybrid online training for panic symptoms and agoraphobia: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Ebenfeld L, Kleine Stegemann S, Lehr D, Ebert DD, Jazaieri H, van Ballegooijen W, Funk B, Riper H, Berking M.",Trials. 2014 Nov 4;15:427. doi: 10.1186/1745-6215-15-427.,Ebenfeld L,Trials,2014,2014/11/06,PMC4233107,,10.1186/1745-6215-15-427,"BACKGROUND: Recently, internet-based interventions have been proposed as effective treatments for people with panic disorder (PD). However, little is known about the clinical effects of integrating mobile technology into these interventions. Because users carry their smartphones with them throughout the day, we hypothesize that this technology can be used to significantly support individuals with monitoring and overcoming their PD symptoms. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed hybrid intervention that combines internet/PC with smartphone delivery to treat the symptoms of PD. The intervention is based on cognitive behavioral therapy and consists of six modules over a total of six weeks. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to evaluate the effects of a hybrid online training module for PD. Based on a power calculation (d =0.60; 1-beta of 80%; alpha =0.05), 90 participants with mild to moderate panic symptoms with or without agoraphobia (as assessed by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale) will be recruited from the general population and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. The primary outcome measure will be the severity of panic symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include depression, quality of life, and an observer-based rating of panic severity. Furthermore, data regarding acceptance and the usability of the smartphone app will be assessed. Assessments will take place at baseline as well as eight weeks, three months, and six months after randomization. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from a societal perspective. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this RCT is one of the first to examine the efficacy of a hybrid online training for adult PD. This study seeks to contribute to the emerging field of hybrid online training. If the intervention is efficacious, then research on this hybrid online training should be extended. The cost-effectiveness analysis will also indicate whether online training is an economical tool for treating PD among adults.

Improving Mild to Moderate Depression With an App-Based Self-Guided Intervention: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Beintner I, Kerber A, Dominke C, Voderholzer U.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Oct 25;12:e46651. doi: 10.2196/46651.,Beintner I,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/10/25,PMC10632923,,10.2196/46651,"BACKGROUND: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders and frequently co-occurs with other mental disorders. Despite the high direct and indirect costs to both individuals and society, more than 80% of those diagnosed with depression remain with their primary care physician and do not receive specialized treatment. Self-guided digital interventions have been shown to improve depression and, due to their scalability, have a large potential public health impact. Current digital interventions often focus on specific disorders, while recent research suggests that transdiagnostic approaches are more suitable. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to assess the efficacy of a self-guided transdiagnostic app-based self-management intervention in patients with mild or moderate depression with and without comorbid mental disorders. Specifically, we are investigating the impact of the intervention on symptoms of depression, quality of life, anxiety symptoms, and mental health-related patient empowerment and self-management skills. METHODS: The intervention under investigation, MindDoc with Prescription, is a self-guided digital intervention aimed at supporting individuals with mild to moderate mental disorders from the internalizing spectrum, including depression. The app can be used as a low-threshold psychosocial intervention. Up to 570 adult patients will be randomized to either receive the intervention in addition to care as usual or only care as usual. We are including adults with a permanent residency in Germany and mild or moderate depression according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, criteria (F32.0, F32.1, F33.0, and F33.1). Clinical interviews will be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. Data will be collected at baseline as well as 8 weeks and 6 months after randomization. The primary outcome will be depression symptom severity after 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes will be quality of life, anxiety symptom severity, and patient empowerment and self-management behaviors. Data will be analyzed using multiple imputations, using the intention-to-treat principle, while sensitivity analyses will be based on additional imputation strategies and a per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: Recruitment for the trial started on February 7, 2023, and the first participant was randomized on February 14, 2023. As of September 5, 2023, 275 participants have been included in the trial and 176 have provided the primary outcome. The rate of missing values in the primary outcome is approximately 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this efficacy trial will be used to establish whether access to the intervention is associated with an improvement in depression symptoms in individuals diagnosed with mild or moderate depression. The study will contribute to expanding the evidence base on transdiagnostic digital interventions.

Evaluating the effectiveness of a mobile app-based self-guided psychological interventions to reduce relapse in substance use disorder: protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Redeł A, Binkowska AA, Obarska K, Marcowski P, Szymczak K, Lewczuk K, Solich K, Banaszak M, Woronowicz B, Nowicka M, Skorko M, Gola M, Bielecki M.",Front Psychiatry. 2024 May 8;15:1335105. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1335105. eCollection 2024.,Redeł A,Front Psychiatry,2024,2024/05/24,PMC11113013,,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1335105,"BACKGROUND: Substance Use Disorder (SUD) persists as a significant public health challenge worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 10-15% across the global populace. This condition is characterized by a notably high risk of lapses and relapses, even subsequent to treatment interventions. Mobile health interventions, owing to their widespread accessibility, emerge as a promising approach to diminish the risk of relapse post-treatment and to broaden the scope of care, especially in regions with a scarcity of trained medical professionals. METHOD: This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of mobile interventions in mitigating cravings and preventing lapses among individuals diagnosed with SUD. Employing a two-armed, randomized controlled trial framework, the study will evaluate a self-administered psychological intervention delivered through a mobile application, Nalogometr 2.0. Over a period of three months, participants will engage with intervention modules that primarily incorporate mindfulness techniques and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) will be utilized to gather longitudinal data on a range of variables that are indicative of craving intensity and the risk of lapse. In addition to this, a monthly-administered battery of questionnaires will be employed to gauge the severity of substance dependence, as well as to measure levels of anxiety, depression, and overall life satisfaction. RESULTS: Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier [NCT05730504]."
mHealth interventions to reduce stress in healthcare workers (fitcor): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Baumann H, Heuel L, Bischoff LL, Wollesen B.",Trials. 2023 Mar 4;24(1):163. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07182-7.,Baumann H,Trials,2023,2023/03/03,PMC9985281,,10.1186/s13063-023-07182-7,"BACKGROUND: Causes and consequences of chronic stress levels in the context of healthcare work are well examined. Nevertheless, the implementation and evaluation of high-quality interventions to reduce stress of healthcare workers is still missing. Internet and app-based interventions are a promising venue for providing interventions for stress reduction to a population that is otherwise difficult to reach due to shift work and time constraints in general. To do so, we developed the internet and app-based intervention (fitcor), a digital coaching of individual stress coping for health care workers. METHODS: We applied the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement as a guideline for the present protocol. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted. There are five different intervention groups and one waiting control group. To achieve the sample sizes required by power analysis (G*Power) (beta-error 80%; effect size 0.25), the sample sizes of the respective scenarios will be at best as follows: 336 care workers from hospitals, 192 administrative health personnel, 145 care workers from stationary elderly care homes, and 145 care workers from ambulatory care providers in Germany. Participants will randomly be assigned to one of five different intervention groups. A crossover design with a waiting control group is planned. Interventions will be accompanied by three measurement points, first a baseline measure, second a post-intervention measure directly after completion of the intervention, and a follow-up measure 6 weeks after completion of the intervention. At all three measurement points, perceived team conflict, work-related experience patterns, personality, satisfaction with internet-based training, and back pain will be assessed using questionnaires, as well as heart rate variability, sleep quality, and daily movement will be recorded using an advanced sensor. DISCUSSION: Workers in the health care sector increasingly face high job demands and stress levels. Traditional health interventions fail to reach the respective population due to organizational constraints. Implementation of digital health interventions has been found to improve stress coping behavior; however, the evidence in health care settings has not been established. To the best of our knowledge, fitcor is the first internet and app-based intervention to reduce stress among nursing and administrative health care personnel.

Empowering Foot Care Literacy Among People Living With Diabetes and Their Carers With an mHealth App: Protocol for a Feasibility Study,"Liew H, Pienkowska A, Ang CS, Mahadzir MDA, Goh KFI, Lodh N, Bojic I, Lawate A, Ong QC, Venkataraman K, Car J, Ho AHY.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Nov 21;12:e52036. doi: 10.2196/52036.,Liew H,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/11/21,PMC10698655,,10.2196/52036,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) cause significant morbidity affecting 19% to 34% of people living with diabetes mellitus. DFUs not only impair quality of life but may also result in limb loss and mortality. Patient education has been advocated to raise awareness of proper foot self-care and the necessity of seeking assistance when a foot wound occurs. Modern technologies, including mobile health (mHealth) interventions such as health apps, bring the potential for more cost-effective and scalable interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility and usability of a newly developed mHealth app called Well Feet, which is a diabetes and foot care education app for individuals at risk of developing DFU. METHODS: Well Feet was developed using an evidence-based and expert panel cocreation approach to deliver educational content available in 3 languages (ie, English, Chinese, and Malay) via animation videos and a range of additional features, including adaptive learning. A nonrandomized, single-arm feasibility study using a mixed methods approach with a series of validated questionnaires and focus group discussions will be conducted. In total, 40 patients and carers will be recruited from a tertiary hospital diabetes clinic to receive a 1-month mHealth intervention. The primary outcomes are the usability of the app and a qualitative perspective on user experience. Secondary outcomes include changes in foot care knowledge, self-management behaviors, and quality of life. RESULTS: Patient recruitment began in July 2023, and the intervention and data collection will be completed by the end of September 2023. This study has been approved by National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board (2022/00614) on February 10, 2023. The expected results will be published in spring 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Through this feasibility study, the Well Feet DFU education app will undergo a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of its usability and acceptance for future improvement in its design. With local contextualization, cultural adaptation, and its multilingual functionality, the app addresses a critical aspect of DFU health education and self-management in a multiethnic population. Findings from this study will refine and enhance the features of the app based on user feedback and shape the procedural framework for a subsequent randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of Well Feet.

Toward Increasing Engagement in Substance Use Data Collection: Development of the Substance Abuse Research Assistant App and Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial Using Adolescents and Emerging Adults,"Rabbi M, Philyaw Kotov M, Cunningham R, Bonar EE, Nahum-Shani I, Klasnja P, Walton M, Murphy S.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2018 Jul 18;7(7):e166. doi: 10.2196/resprot.9850.,Rabbi M,JMIR Res Protoc,2018,2018/07/20,PMC6070723,,10.2196/resprot.9850,"BACKGROUND: Substance use is an alarming public health issue associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Adolescents and emerging adults are at particularly high risk because substance use typically initiates and peaks during this developmental period. Mobile health apps are a promising data collection and intervention delivery tool for substance-using youth as most teens and young adults own a mobile phone. However, engagement with data collection for most mobile health applications is low, and often, large fractions of users stop providing data after a week of use. OBJECTIVE: Substance Abuse Research Assistant (SARA) is a mobile application to increase or sustain engagement of substance data collection overtime. SARA provides a variety of engagement strategies to incentivize data collection: a virtual aquarium in the app grows with fish and aquatic resources; occasionally, funny or inspirational contents (eg, memes or text messages) are provided to generate positive emotions. We plan to assess the efficacy of SARA's engagement strategies over time by conducting a micro-randomized trial, where the engagement strategies will be sequentially manipulated. METHODS: We aim to recruit participants (aged 14-24 years), who report any binge drinking or marijuana use in the past month. Participants are instructed to use SARA for 1 month. During this period, participants are asked to complete one survey and two active tasks every day between 6 pm and midnight. Through the survey, we assess participants' daily mood, stress levels, loneliness, and hopefulness, while through the active tasks, we measure reaction time and spatial memory. To incentivize and support the data collection, a variety of engagement strategies are used. First, predata collection strategies include the following: (1) at 4 pm, a push notification may be issued with an inspirational message from a contemporary celebrity; or (2) at 6 pm, a push notification may be issued reminding about data collection and incentives. Second, postdata collection strategies include various rewards such as points which can be used to grow a virtual aquarium with fishes and other treasures and modest monetary rewards (up to US $12; US $1 for each 3-day streak); also, participants may receive funny or inspirational content as memes or gifs or visualizations of prior data. During the study, the participants will be randomized every day to receive different engagement strategies. In the primary analysis, we will assess whether issuing 4 pm push-notifications or memes or gifs, respectively, increases self-reporting on the current or the following day. RESULTS: The microrandomized trial started on August 21, 2017 and the trial ended on February 28, 2018. Seventy-three participants were recruited. Data analysis is currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, SARA is the first mobile phone app that systematically manipulates engagement strategies in order to identify the best sequence of strategies that keep participants engaged in data collection. Once the optimal strategies to collect data are identified, future versions of SARA will use this data to provide just-in-time adaptive interventions to reduce substance use among youth.

The study aims to: (1) identify and address barriers and facilitators that may impact implementation and sustainability of the website into routine clinical care; (2) evaluate implementation quality to inform spread and scale-up. We will conduct a multi-stage approach using qualitative methods, guided by the Quality Implementation Framework and using a qualitative content analysis approach. First, we will identify perceived barriers and facilitators to implementation and considerations for sustainability through interviews with clinicians, based on the Readiness Thinking Tool and the Long Term Success Tool. Analysis will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Theoretical Domains Framework. Appropriate implementation strategies will be identified using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change compilation, and implementation plans will be developed based on Proctor's recommendations and the Action, Actor, Context, Target, Time framework. Finally, we will explore implementation quality guided by the RE-AIM framework. There is limited literature describing systematic approaches to implementing and sustaining patient-focused self-management tools into clinical care, in addition to employing tailored implementation strategies to promote adoption and sustainability.

Development and Evaluation of a Digital Health Intervention for Substance Use Reduction in Young Refugees With Problematic Use of Alcohol and/or Cannabis-Study Protocol for a Single-Armed Feasibility Trial,"Fischer LC, Kölligan V, Wieland N, Klein M.",Front Public Health. 2021 Mar 31;9:557431. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2021.557431. eCollection 2021.,Fischer LC,Front Public Health,2021,2021/04/19,PMC8044446,,10.3389/fpubh.2021.557431,"Background: Refugee populations are at substantial risk of developing substance use disorder (SUD) and other mental health disorders. At the same time, refugee populations face numerous barriers to accessing mental health services. Digital interventions can address some of these issues, as emerging evidence indicates that digital interventions offer an effective, low-cost alternative with high accessibility and similar efficacy as standard SUD prevention programs. As an add-on to traditional services, they further present a viable approach to the lack of personnel available for foreign language communication in preventive and therapeutic settings. In the present study, we thus aim to develop and evaluate a digital health intervention (DHI) for the reduction of substance use for young refugees with problematic use of alcohol and/or cannabis. The intervention will be implemented in a smartphone app, translated into Arabic, English, Farsi, German, and Pashto, and is to be used stand-alone. It is based on methods from cognitive behavioral therapy, contains culturally adapted elements, provides practical information on how to deal safely with alcohol and cannabis, and motivates behavior change through increased self-reflection and behavioral, cognitive, and emotional skills-training in interactive exercises. Methods: We conduct a single-armed feasibility trial among 150 young refugees with problematic use of alcohol and/or cannabis. Participants will receive a digital screening and digital health intervention (DHI) for the reduction of problematic substance use, carried out over a 4-week time frame. The primary outcomes are the intervention's feasibility and the target population's acceptance of the intervention. The secondary outcome is a change in substance use post-intervention from baseline. Measurements are taken pre-intervention (baseline), post-intervention (after 4 weeks), and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. We expect the intervention to be feasible and accepted by the target group. Discussion: The present study will establish to what degree the digital intervention (the ""BePrepared App"") is feasible and accepted by the target group. The evaluation of an easily accessible, feasible, and accepted intervention may impact refugees' mental health and health-related consequences. It aims at overcoming barriers to preventive health care in the substance use field for underserved refugee populations as a tool within a larger set of urgently needed interventions.

The smoking disparities experienced by this group are, in part, a consequence of multiple chronic life stressors (eg, racial discrimination) that engender increased exposure to interoceptive stress symptoms (eg, anxiety), which can ultimately lead to smoking as a means of immediate emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to culturally adapt and initially test a novel mobile intervention (ie, Mobile Anxiety Sensitivity Program for Smoking [MASP]) that targets anxiety sensitivity (AS; a proxy for difficulty and responsivity to interoceptive stress) among Black smokers. The MASP intervention is culturally informed to address interoceptive stress management difficulties among Black smokers and is thus hypothesized to facilitate smoking cessation. METHODS: In phase 1, a total of 25 Black smokers with elevated AS will be administered MASP for 6 weeks. Following the completion of phase 1, we will further refine the MASP based on qualitative and quantitative data from participants to produce the final MASP iteration. In phase 2, a total of 200 Black smokers with elevated AS will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive nicotine replacement therapy and either the smartphone-based National Cancer Institute QuitGuide app for standard mobile smoking cessation treatment or the MASP intervention. All participants in phases 1 and 2 will be enrolled remotely and will complete a web-based study screener; smartphone-based baseline assessment; daily smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments for 6 weeks; phone-based end-of-treatment qualitative interviews; and smartphone-based follow-up assessments at postbaseline weeks 1, 2 (quit date), 3, 4, 5, 6, 28, and 54 (weeks 28 and 54 follow-ups will be completed by phase 2 participants only). The MASP intervention is intended to offset barriers to treatment and encourage treatment engagement via smartphones. RESULTS: This project was funded in September 2020. Phase 1 data collection began in January 2022. Phase 2 data collection is scheduled to begin in July 2022. CONCLUSIONS: If successful, data from this study will support culturally informed treatment approaches for Black smokers and, pending findings of efficacy, provide an evidence-based mobile intervention for smoking cessation that is ready for dissemination and implementation.

This study comprehensively examines eHealth intervention studies among MBS patients within the RE-AIM framework to assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance of these efforts. METHODS: A search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycNET and SCOPUS of original research relating to eHealth strategies for MBS patients published in peer-reviewed journals and revealed 38 published articles between 2011 and 2019. RESULTS: Studies varied widely in terms of design (qualitative to randomized controlled trials) and eHealth delivery method (telemedicine to blog post content) with a balance of pre- or post-MBS use. No studies included adolescents and very few reported (1) a conceptual framework to support study design/outcomes; and (2) race/ethnicity composition. CONCLUSIONS: Although some studies report that eHealth strategies/interventions are effective in producing post-MBS weight loss and other positive health outcomes, most are pilot studies or have study design limitations. There is an opportunity for development of (1) tailored eHealth interventions to support pre- and post-MBS sustained behavior change and improved outcomes; and (2) rigorous studies that employ robust conceptual frameworks so dissemination and implementation efforts can be mapped to construct-driven outcomes."

The frequency, intensity and content of the hierarchical intervention are determined based on the cardiovascular risk stratification of the intervention subjects. STUDY DESIGN: This cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in two subdistricts in Guangzhou, China, among 492 smartphone users with hypertension or prehypertension, from August 2018 to September 2019. The intervention group received hierarchical intervention through WeChat for six months, while the control group received usual care in the community healthcare center during this period. Indicators are measured at three time points for each group, and a telephone follow-up is planned for two years after the intervention. The primary outcome is systolic blood pressure; secondary outcomes include BMI, CPAT score, improvements in behavior and diet, score of self-efficacy and self-management. Feasibility is evaluated by intervention participation. The cost-effectiveness is evaluated by ICER. CONCLUSION: This study aims to evaluate the effect of the WeChat-based hierarchical management mode on improving blood pressure and self-management behavior in population with hypertension and prehypertension, based on health-related knowledge, self-efficacy and medication adherence. If successful, the management mode will serve as a feasible, economical and efficient hypertension management mode suitable for the community.Clinical trial identifier: ChiCTR1900023002."
Refocusing of Attention on Positive Events Using Monitoring-Based Feedback and Microinterventions for Patients With Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in the PerPAIN Randomized Controlled Trial: Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial,"Ader L, Schick A, Löffler M, Löffler A, Beiner E, Eich W, Vock S, Sirazitdinov A, Malone C, Hesser J, Hopp M, Ruckes C, Flor H, Tesarz J, Reininghaus U.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Sep 20;12:e43376. doi: 10.2196/43376.,Ader L,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/09/20,PMC10551789,,10.2196/43376,"BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) affects between 13% and 47% of the population, with a global growth rate of 20.3% within the last 15 years, suggesting that there is a high need for effective treatments. Pain diaries have long been a common tool in nonpharmacological pain treatment for monitoring and providing feedback on patients' symptoms in daily life. More recently, positive refocusing techniques have come to be used, promoting pain-free episodes and positive outcomes rather than focusing on managing the pain. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility (ie, acceptability, intervention adherence, and fidelity) and initial signals of efficacy of the PerPAIN app, an ecological momentary intervention for patients with CMSP. The app comprises digitalized monitoring using the experience sampling method (ESM) and feedback. In addition, the patients receive 3 microinterventions targeted at refocusing of attention on positive events. METHODS: In a microrandomized trial, we will recruit 35 patients with CMSP who will be offered the app for 12 weeks. Participants will be prompted to fill out 4 ESM monitoring questionnaires a day assessing information on their current context and the proximal outcome variables: absence of pain, positive mood, and subjective activity. Participants will be randomized daily and weekly to receive no feedback, verbal feedback, or visual feedback on proximal outcomes assessed by the ESM. In addition, the app will encourage participants to complete 3 microinterventions based on positive psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. These microinterventions are prompts to report joyful moments and everyday successes or to plan pleasant activities. After familiarizing themselves with each microintervention individually, participants will be randomized daily to receive 1 of the 3 exercises or none. We will assess whether the 2 feedback types and the 3 microinterventions increase proximal outcomes at the following time point. The microrandomized trial is part of the PerPAIN randomized controlled trial (German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00022792) investigating a personalized treatment approach to enhance treatment outcomes in CMSP. RESULTS: Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee II of the University of Heidelberg on August 4, 2020. Recruitment for the microrandomized trial began in May 2021 and is ongoing at the time of submission. By October 10, 2022, a total of 24 participants had been enrolled in the microrandomized trial. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will provide evidence on the feasibility of the PerPAIN app and the initial signals of efficacy of the different intervention components. In the next step, the intervention would need to be further refined and investigated in a definitive trial. This ecological momentary intervention presents a potential method for offering low-level accessible treatment to a wide range of people, which could have substantial implications for public health by reducing disease burden of chronic pain in the population.

Analysis of Mobile App-Based Mental Health Solutions for College Students: A Rapid Review,"Choudhury A, Kuehn A, Shamszare H, Shahsavar Y.",Healthcare (Basel). 2023 Jan 16;11(2):272. doi: 10.3390/healthcare11020272.,Choudhury A,Healthcare (Basel),2023,2023/01/21,PMC9859497,,10.3390/healthcare11020272,"BACKGROUND: College students are one of the most susceptible age groups to mental health problems. With the growing popularity of mobile health (mHealth), there is an increasing need to investigate its implications for mental health solutions. This review evaluates mHealth interventions for addressing mental health problems among college students. METHODS: An online database search was conducted. Articles were required to focus on the impact of mHealth intervention on student mental health. Fifteen of the 487 articles, initially pulled from the search query, were included in the review. RESULTS: The review identified three primary aspects of mental health: depression, anxiety, and stress. Research that found statistically significant improvements following mHealth intervention involved study durations between four and eight weeks, daily app use, guided lessons using cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and meditation. The review's findings show that future work must address the concern of digital divide, gender and sex differences, and have larger sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: There is potential to improve depressive symptoms and other similar mental health problems among college students via mobile app interventions. However, actions must be taken to improve barriers to communication and better reach the younger generations."
Assessing the carbon footprint of digital health interventions: a scoping review,"Lokmic-Tomkins Z, Davies S, Block LJ, Cochrane L, Dorin A, von Gerich H, Lozada-Perezmitre E, Reid L, Peltonen LM.",J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2022 Nov 14;29(12):2128-2139. doi: 10.1093/jamia/ocac196.,Lokmic-Tomkins Z,J Am Med Inform Assoc,2022,2022/10/31,PMC9667173,,10.1093/jamia/ocac196,"OBJECTIVE: Integration of environmentally sustainable digital health interventions requires robust evaluation of their carbon emission life-cycle before implementation in healthcare. This scoping review surveys the evidence on available environmental assessment frameworks, methods, and tools to evaluate the carbon footprint of digital health interventions for environmentally sustainable healthcare. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid). PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus (which indexes IEEE Xplore, Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science and ACM databases), Compendex, and Inspec databases were searched with no time or language constraints. The Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA_SCR), Joanna Briggs Scoping Review Framework, and template for intervention description and replication (TiDiER) checklist were used to structure and report the findings. RESULTS: From 3299 studies screened, data was extracted from 13 full-text studies. No standardised methods or validated tools were identified to systematically determine the environmental sustainability of a digital health intervention over its full life-cycle from conception to realisation. Most studies (n = 8) adapted publicly available carbon calculators to estimate telehealth travel-related emissions. Others adapted these tools to examine the environmental impact of electronic health records (n = 2), e-prescriptions and e-referrals (n = 1), and robotic surgery (n = 1). One study explored optimising the information system electricity consumption of telemedicine. No validated systems-based approach to evaluation and validation of digital health interventions could be identified. CONCLUSION: There is a need to develop standardised, validated methods and tools for healthcare environments to assist stakeholders to make informed decisions about reduction of carbon emissions from digital health interventions."
Assessing the Quality of the World Health Organization's Skin NTDs App as a Training Tool in Ghana and Kenya: Protocol for a Cross-sectional Study,"Frej A, Cano M, Ruiz-Postigo JA, Macharia P, Phillips RO, Amoako YA, Carrion C.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Dec 8;11(12):e39393. doi: 10.2196/39393.,Frej A,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/12/08,PMC9782345,,10.2196/39393,"BACKGROUND: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affect over 1.5 billion people worldwide, the majority of them belonging to impoverished populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Skin NTDs are a subgroup of NTDs that manifest primarily as skin lesions. The diagnosis and treatment of skin NTDs entail considerable resources, including trained personnel and financial backing. Many interventions are being launched and evaluated, particularly mobile health (mHealth) interventions, such as Skin NTDs App, a training and decision support tool offered by the World Health Organization (WHO) for frontline health workers (FHWs). As most digital health guidelines prioritize the thorough evaluation of mHealth interventions, it is essential to conduct a rigorous and validated assessment of Skin NTDs App. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the quality of version 3 of Skin NTDs App, developed for the WHO by Universal Doctor and Netherlands Leprosy Relief as a training and decision support tool for FHWs. METHODS: A cross-sectional study will be conducted in 2 LMICs: Ghana and Kenya. We will use snowball sampling recruitment to select 48 participants from the target population of all FHWs dealing with skin NTDs. The sample group of FHWs will be asked to download and use Skin NTDs App for at least 5 days before answering a web-based survey containing demographic variables and the user Mobile App Rating Scale (uMARS) questionnaire. A semistructured interview will then be conducted. Quantitative and qualitative data will be analyzed using SPSS (version 25; SPSS Inc), with statistical significance for all tests set at a 95% CI and P</=.05 considered significant. Data derived from the semistructured interviews will be clustered in themes and coded to enable analysis of various dimensions using ATLAS.ti. RESULTS: The estimated completion date of the study is in the third quarter of 2022. The results are expected to show that Skin NTDs App version 3 has a good reported user experience, as assessed using the uMARS scale. No differences are expected to be found, except for those related to experience in dermatology and the use of mobile technology that could influence the final score. Semistructured interviews are expected to complete the results obtained on the uMARS scale. Moreover, they will be the previous step before assessing other aspects of the app, such as its efficiency and how it should be disseminated or implemented. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first step in a qualitative and quantitative assessment of Skin NTDs App as a training and support tool for FHWs diagnosing and managing skin NTDs. Our results will serve to improve future versions of the App. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/39393."
Development of a Digital Health Intervention for Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptom Management in a Biotechnology Industry Context: Protocol for the Application of a Human-Centered Design Framework,"Nugent L, Anthony Kouyate R, Jackson S, Smith MY.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Mar 22;11(3):e16430. doi: 10.2196/16430.,Nugent L,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/03/22,PMC8984827,,10.2196/16430,"BACKGROUND: Involving chronically ill patients in the management of their health is widely recognized as a vital component of high-quality health care. However, to assume the role of informed participants, patients need both access to their health information and assistance in interpreting such data. Smartphone technology with SMS text messaging functionality offers a convenient and minimally demanding mechanism for providing such dual capabilities to patients. To date, a number of similar digital tools have been developed for use in various chronic and progressive disease conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the development of a research protocol that applies a human-centered design (HCD) approach to develop a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to support symptom management and treatment adherence for rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: To guide the development of the mHealth intervention for use within a commercial biotechnology context, we selected and applied an HCD framework consisting of three phases: understanding, ideation, and implementation. RESULTS: Leveraging the framework, we mapped the key objectives and research questions to each phase and identified the HCD techniques and methods most suitable for addressing them. In addition, we identified the need to include a fourth phase, one that referred to postimplementation assessment, which would enable evaluation of patient engagement and intervention impact on symptom self-management. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a research protocol that applied an HCD framework to guide the development of an mHealth intervention within a commercial biotechnology context. This type of guidance is salient because commercial entities are becoming one of the leading producers of this type of intervention. However, the methodologies used and challenges faced from a research and development perspective are not well-represented in the published research literature to date. Our application of the HCD framework yielded important findings. Each phase of the HCD framework provided important guidance for increasing the likelihood that the final product would be understandable, acceptable, feasible, and engaging to use. Consistent with other researchers in the field of mHealth interventions, we identified the need to add a fourth phase to the HCD framework, one that focused on a postimplementation assessment to guide further improvements to support adoption in real-world settings.

In this paper, we describe the development of a mHealth intervention on the basis of supportive self-monitoring and describe the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness among smartphone users with psychological distress. Based on power analysis, a representative quota sample of N = 186 smartphone users will be recruited, with an over-sampling of persons with moderate to high distress. Over a 4-week period, the intervention will be compared to a self-monitoring without intervention group and a passive control group. Telephone interviews will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks), and 12-week follow-up to assess study outcomes. The primary outcome will be improvement of mental health. Secondary outcomes will include well-being, intentions toward help-seeking and help-seeking behavior, user activation, attitudes toward mental-health services, perceived stigmatization, smartphone app quality, user satisfaction, engagement, and adherence with the intervention. Additionally, data from the user's daily life as collected during self-monitoring will be used to investigate risk and protective factors of mental health in real-world settings. Therefore, this study will allow us to demonstrate the effectiveness of a smartphone application as a widely accessible and low-cost intervention to improve mental health on a population level. It also allows to identify new assessment approaches in the field of psychiatric epidemiology."
Digital Health Interventions to Enhance Tuberculosis Treatment Adherence: Scoping Review,"Lee S, Rajaguru V, Baek JS, Shin J, Park Y.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Dec 4;11:e49741. doi: 10.2196/49741.,Lee S,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/12/06,PMC10718480,,10.2196/49741,"BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies are widely used for disease management, with their computing platforms, software, and sensors being used for health care. These technologies are developed to manage chronic diseases and infectious bacterial diseases, including tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to comprehensively review the literature on the use of digital health interventions (DHIs) for enhancing TB treatment adherence and identify major strategies for their adoption. METHODS: We conducted a literature search in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, and Scopus databases for relevant studies published between January 2012 and March 2022. Studies that focused on web-based or mobile phone-based interventions, medication adherence, digital health, randomized controlled trials, digital interventions, or mobile health and ubiquitous health technology for TB treatment and related health outcomes were included. RESULTS: We identified 27 relevant studies and classified them according to the intervention method, a significant difference in treatment success, and health outcomes. The following interventions were emphasized: SMS text messaging interventions (8/27, 30%), medicine reminders (6/27, 22%), and web-based direct observation therapy (9/27, 33%). Digital health technology significantly promoted disease management among individuals and health care professionals. However, only a few studies addressed 2-way communication therapies, such as interactive SMS text messaging and feedback systems. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review classified studies on DHIs for patients with TB and demonstrated their potential for the self-management of TB. DHIs are still being developed, and evidence on the impact of digital technologies on enhancing TB treatment adherence remains limited. However, it is necessary to encourage patients' participation in TB treatment and self-management through bidirectional communication. We emphasize the importance of developing a communication system."
Self-management of Chronic Conditions Using mHealth Interventions in Korea: A Systematic Review,"Yi JY, Kim Y, Cho YM, Kim H.",Healthc Inform Res. 2018 Jul;24(3):187-197. doi: 10.4258/hir.2018.24.3.187.

In this study, we conducted a systematic review of mHealth interventions for the self-management of chronic diseases in Korea, a highly-connected country with a high chronic care burden. METHODS: Five databases were searched for relevant empirical studies that employed randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-experimental methods published in English or Korean from the years 2008 to 2018. The selected studies were reviewed according to the PRISMA guidelines. The selected studies were classified using the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory conceptual framework. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria, 9 of which were targeted towards diabetes management, and 7 of which were RCTs. Other target diseases included hypertension, stroke, asthma, and others. mHealth interventions were primarily delivered through smartphone applications, mobile phones connected to a monitoring device, and short message services (SMS). Various self-management processes were applied, including providing social influence and support, and facilitating self-monitoring and goal setting. Eleven studies showed mHealth interventions to be effective in improving self-management behaviors, biomarkers, or patient-reported outcome measures associated with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: While the number of identified studies was not large, none reported negative impacts of mHealth on selected outcomes. Future studies on mHealth should design interventions with a greater variety of targeted functions and should adopt more rigorous methodologies to strengthen the evidence for its effectiveness in chronic disease management."

Online and social networking interventions for the treatment of depression in young people: a systematic review,"Rice SM, Goodall J, Hetrick SE, Parker AG, Gilbertson T, Amminger GP, Davey CG, McGorry PD, Gleeson J, Alvarez-Jimenez M.",J Med Internet Res. 2014 Sep 16;16(9):e206. doi: 10.2196/jmir.3304.,Rice SM,J Med Internet Res,2014,2014/09/18,PMC4180352,,10.2196/jmir.3304,"BACKGROUND: Major depression accounts for the greatest burden of all diseases globally. The peak onset of depression occurs between adolescence and young adulthood, and for many individuals, depression displays a relapse-remitting and increasingly severe course. Given this, the development of cost-effective, acceptable, and population-focused interventions for depression is critical. A number of online interventions (both prevention and acute phase) have been tested in young people with promising results. As these interventions differ in content, clinician input, and modality, it is important to identify key features (or unhelpful functions) associated with treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of the research literature was undertaken. The review was designed to focus on two aspects of online intervention: (1) standard approaches evaluating online intervention content in randomized controlled designs (Section 1), and (2) second-generation online interventions and services using social networking (eg, social networking sites and online support groups) in any type of research design (Section 2). METHODS: Two specific literature searches were undertaken. There was no date range specified. The Section 1 search, which focused on randomized controlled trials, included only young people (12-25 years) and yielded 101 study abstracts, of which 15 met the review inclusion criteria. The Section 2 search, which included all study design types and was not restricted in terms of age, yielded 358 abstracts, of which 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Information about the studies and their findings were extracted and tabulated for review. RESULTS: The 15 studies identified in Section 1 described 10 trials testing eight different online interventions, all of which were based on a cognitive behavioral framework. All but one of the eight identified studies reported positive results; however, only five of the 15 studies used blinded interviewer administered outcomes with most trials using self-report data. Studies varied significantly in presentation of intervention content, treatment dose, and dropout. Only two studies included moderator or clinician input. Results for Section 2 were less consistent. None of the Section 2 studies reported controlled or randomized designs. With the exception of four studies, all included participants were younger than 25 years of age. Eight of the 16 social networking studies reported positive results for depression-related outcomes. The remaining studies were either mixed or negative. Findings for online support groups tended to be more positive; however, noteworthy risks were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Online interventions with a broad cognitive behavioral focus appear to be promising in reducing depression symptomology in young people. Further research is required into the effectiveness of online interventions delivering cognitive behavioral subcomponents, such as problem-solving therapy. Evidence for the use of social networking is less compelling, although limited by a lack of well-designed studies and social networking interventions. A range of future social networking therapeutic opportunities are highlighted."
A Nurse Case Management HIV Prevention Intervention (Come As You Are) for Youth Experiencing Homelessness: Protocol for a Randomized Wait-list Controlled Trial,"Santa Maria D, Lightfoot M, Nyamathi A, Businelle M, Paul M, Quadri Y, Padhye N, Jones J, Calvo Armijo M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 May 21;10(5):e26716. doi: 10.2196/26716.,Santa Maria D,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/05/21,PMC8178739,,10.2196/26716,"BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness are more likely than housed youth to experience premature death, suicide, drug overdose, pregnancy, substance use, and mental illness. Yet while youth experiencing homelessness are 6 to 12 times more likely to become infected with HIV than housed youth, with HIV prevalence as high as 16%, many do not access the prevention services they need. Despite adversities, youth experiencing homelessness are interested in health promotion programs, can be recruited and retained in interventions and research studies, and demonstrate improved outcomes when programs are tailored and relevant to them. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to compare the efficacy of a nurse case management HIV prevention and care intervention, titled Come As You Are, with that of usual care among youth experiencing homelessness aged 16 to 25 years. METHODS: The study is designed as a 2-armed randomized wait-list controlled trial. Participants (n=450) will be recruited and followed up for 9 months after the intervention for a total study period of 12 months. Come As You Are combines nurse case management with a smartphone-based daily ecological momentary assessment to develop participant-driven HIV prevention behavioral goals that can be monitored in real-time. Youth in the city of Houston, Texas will be recruited from drop-in centers, shelters, street outreach programs, youth-serving organizations, and clinics. RESULTS: Institutional review board approval (Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston) was obtained in November 2018. The first participant was enrolled in November 2019. Data collection is ongoing. To date, 123 participants have consented to participate in the study, 89 have been enrolled, and 15 have completed their final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of HIV prevention research regarding youth experiencing homelessness. Novel and scalable interventions that address the full continuum of behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention are needed. This study will determine whether a personalized and mobile HIV prevention approach can reduce HIV risk among a hard-to-reach, transient population of youth at high risk.

A Scoping Review and a Taxonomy to Assess the Impact of Mobile Apps on Cancer Care Management,"Dhar E, Bah AN, Chicchi Giglioli IA, Quer S, Fernandez-Luque L, Núñez-Benjumea FJ, Malwade S, Uddin M, Upadhyay U, Syed-Abdul S.",Cancers (Basel). 2023 Mar 15;15(6):1775. doi: 10.3390/cancers15061775.,Dhar E,Cancers (Basel),2023,2023/03/29,PMC10046563,,10.3390/cancers15061775,"Mobile Health (mHealth) has a great potential to enhance the self-management of cancer patients and survivors. Our study aimed to perform a scoping review to evaluate the impact and trends of mobile application-based interventions on adherence and their effects on health outcomes among the cancer population. In addition, we aimed to develop a taxonomy of mobile-app-based interventions to assist app developers and healthcare researchers in creating future mHealth cancer care solutions. Relevant articles were screened from the online databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, spanning the time period from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2022. Of the 4135 articles initially identified, 55 were finally selected for the review. In the selected studies, breast cancer was the focus of 20 studies (36%), while mixed cancers were the subject of 23 studies (42%). The studies revealed that the usage rate of mHealth was over 80% in 41 of the 55 studies, with factors such as guided supervision, personalized suggestions, theoretical intervention foundations, and wearable technology enhancing adherence and efficacy. However, cancer progression, technical challenges, and unfamiliarity with devices were common factors that led to dropouts. We also proposed a taxonomy based on diverse theoretical foundations of mHealth interventions, delivery methods, psycho-educational programs, and social platforms. We suggest that future research should investigate, improve, and verify this taxonomy classification to enhance the design and efficacy of mHealth interventions."
Integrated therapist and online CBT for depression in primary care (INTERACT): study protocol for a multi-centre randomised controlled trial,"Tallon D, Thomas L, Brabyn S, Ching BCF, Hahn JS, Jude B, X Logan M, Burrage A, Fox F, Gilbody S, Lanham P, Lewis G, Li J, MacNeill SJ, Nazareth I, Parrott S, Peters TJ, Shafran R, Turner K, Williams C, Kessler D, Wiles N.",Trials. 2023 Jun 20;24(1):421. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07396-9.,Tallon D,Trials,2023,2023/06/20,PMC10283272,,10.1186/s13063-023-07396-9,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for depression. Self-directed online CBT interventions have made CBT more accessible at a lower cost. However, adherence is often poor and, in the absence of therapist support, effects are modest and short-term. Delivering CBT online using instant messaging is clinically and cost-effective; however, most existing platforms are limited to instant messaging sessions, without the support of between-session ""homework"" activities. The INTERACT intervention integrates online CBT materials and 'high-intensity' therapist-led CBT, delivered remotely in real-time. The INTERACT trial will evaluate this novel integration in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to therapists and clients. METHODS: Pragmatic, two parallel-group multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial, with 434 patients recruited from primary care practices in Bristol, London and York. Participants with depression will be identified via General Practitioner record searches and direct referrals. INCLUSION CRITERIA: aged >/= 18 years; score >/= 14 on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II); meeting International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for depression. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: alcohol or substance dependency in the past year; bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; psychosis; dementia; currently under psychiatric care for depression (including those referred but not yet seen); cannot complete questionnaires unaided or requires an interpreter; currently receiving CBT/other psychotherapy; received high-intensity CBT in the past four years; participating in another intervention trial; unwilling/unable to receive CBT via computer/laptop/smartphone. Eligible participants will be randomised to integrated CBT or usual care. Integrated CBT utilises the standard Beckian intervention for depression and comprises nine live therapist-led sessions, with (up to) a further three if clinically appropriate. The first session is 60-90 min via videocall, with subsequent 50-min sessions delivered online, using instant messaging. Participants allocated integrated CBT can access integrated online CBT resources (worksheets/information sheets/videos) within and between sessions. Outcome assessments at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month post-randomisation. The primary outcome is the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) score at 6 months (as a continuous variable). A nested qualitative study and health economic evaluation will be conducted. DISCUSSION: If clinically and cost-effective, this model of integrated CBT could be introduced into existing psychological services, increasing access to, and equity of, CBT provision.

Methods for Human-Centered eHealth Development: Narrative Scoping Review,"Kip H, Keizer J, da Silva MC, Beerlage-de Jong N, Köhle N, Kelders SM.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Jan 27;24(1):e31858. doi: 10.2196/31858.,Kip H,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/01/27,PMC8832261,,10.2196/31858,"BACKGROUND: Thorough holistic development of eHealth can contribute to a good fit among the technology, its users, and the context. However, despite the availability of frameworks, not much is known about specific research activities for different aims, phases, and settings. This results in researchers having to reinvent the wheel. Consequently, there is a need to synthesize existing knowledge on research activities for participatory eHealth development processes. OBJECTIVE: The 3 main goals of this review are to create an overview of the development strategies used in studies based on the CeHRes (Center for eHealth Research) Roadmap, create an overview of the goals for which these methods can be used, and provide insight into the lessons learned about these methods. METHODS: We included eHealth development studies that were based on the phases and/or principles of the CeHRes Roadmap. This framework was selected because of its focus on participatory, iterative eHealth design in context and to limit the scope of this review. Data were extracted about the type of strategy used, rationale for using the strategy, research questions, and reported information on lessons learned. The most frequently mentioned lessons learned were summarized using a narrative, inductive approach. RESULTS: In the included 160 papers, a distinction was made between overarching development methods (n=10) and products (n=7). Methods are used to gather new data, whereas products can be used to synthesize previously collected data and support the collection of new data. The identified methods were focus groups, interviews, questionnaires, usability tests, literature studies, desk research, log data analyses, card sorting, Delphi studies, and experience sampling. The identified products were prototypes, requirements, stakeholder maps, values, behavior change strategies, personas, and business models. Examples of how these methods and products were applied in the development process and information about lessons learned were provided. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is a plethora of methods and products that can be used at different points in the development process and in different settings. To do justice to the complexity of eHealth development, it seems that multiple strategies should be combined. In addition, we found no evidence for an optimal single step-by-step approach to develop eHealth. Rather, researchers need to select the most suitable research methods for their research objectives, the context in which data are collected, and the characteristics of the participants. This study serves as a first step toward creating a toolkit to support researchers in applying the CeHRes Roadmap to practice. In this way, they can shape the most suitable and efficient eHealth development process."
Aim2Be mHealth intervention for children with overweight and obesity: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Mâsse LC, Vlaar J, Macdonald J, Bradbury J, Warshawski T, Buckler EJ, Hamilton J, Ho J, Buchholz A, Morrison KM, Ball GDC.",Trials. 2020 Feb 3;21(1):132. doi: 10.1186/s13063-020-4080-2.,Mâsse LC,Trials,2020,2020/02/05,PMC6998843,,10.1186/s13063-020-4080-2,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of overweight and obesity remains high in Canada, and the current standard for the treatment of childhood obesity is in-person, family-based, multidisciplinary interventions that target lifestyle behaviors (e.g., diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors). These programs are costly to operate, have limited success, and report recruitment and retention challenges. With recent advances in technology, mobile health or mHealth has been presented as a viable alternative to in-person interventions for behavior change, especially with teens. PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy of Aim2Be, a gamified app based on behavior change theory with health coaching to improve weight outcomes (i.e., decrease in standardized body mass index (zBMI)) and lifestyle behaviors (i.e., improve dietary quality, increase fruit and vegetable intake, reduce sugar-sweetened beverage intake, increase physical activity, and reduce screen time) among children 10- to 17-years old with overweight or obesity versus their peers randomized into a waitlist control condition. The secondary aims of this study are to 1) test whether supplementing the Aim2Be program with health coaching increases adherence and 2) examine the mediators and moderators of adherence to the Aim2Be intervention. METHODS: We will employ a randomized controlled trial design and recruit 200 child and parent dyads to participate in the study (2019-2020). Participants will be recruited from Canadian pediatric weight management clinics and through online advertisements. Child participants must be between the ages of 10 and 17 years, have overweight or obesity, be able to read English at least at a grade 5 level, and have a mobile phone or home computer with internet access. Following baseline data collection, participants will be randomized into intervention and waitlist control groups. Intervention participants will receive access to Aim2Be, with access to health coaching. After having their data collected for 3 months, the control group will gain access to Aim2Be, with no access to health coaching. Participants will control their frequency and duration of app usage to promote autonomy. DISCUSSION: Findings from this study will determine the efficacy of using Aim2Be in improving child weight outcomes and lifestyle behaviors and guide future mHealth interventions for pediatric weight management.

Study protocol of the Health4Life initiative: a cluster randomised controlled trial of an eHealth school-based program targeting multiple lifestyle risk behaviours among young Australians,"Teesson M, Champion KE, Newton NC, Kay-Lambkin F, Chapman C, Thornton L, Slade T, Sunderland M, Mills K, Gardner LA, Parmenter B, Lubans DR, Hides L, McBride N, Allsop S, Spring BJ, Smout S, Osman B; Health4Life Team.",BMJ Open. 2020 Jul 13;10(7):e035662. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035662.,Teesson M,BMJ Open,2020,2020/07/16,PMC7359380,,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035662,"INTRODUCTION: Lifestyle risk behaviours, including alcohol use, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, poor sleep (duration and/or quality) and sedentary recreational screen time ('the Big 6'), are strong determinants of chronic disease. These behaviours often emerge during adolescence and co-occur. School-based interventions have the potential to address risk factors prior to the onset of disease, yet few eHealth school-based interventions target multiple behaviours concurrently. This paper describes the protocol of the Health4Life Initiative, an eHealth school-based intervention that concurrently addresses the Big 6 risk behaviours among secondary school students. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multisite cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among year 7 students (11-13 years old) from 72 Australian schools. Stratified block randomisation will be used to assign schools to either the Health4Life intervention or an active control (health education as usual). Health4Life consists of (1) six web-based cartoon modules and accompanying activities delivered during health education (once per week for 6 weeks), and a smartphone application (universal prevention), and (2) additional app content, for students engaging in two or more risk behaviours when they are in years 8 and 9 (selective prevention). Students will complete online self-report questionnaires at baseline, post intervention, and 12, 24 and 36 months after baseline. Primary outcomes are consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, sleep duration, sedentary recreational screen time and uptake of alcohol and tobacco use. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the University of Sydney (2018/882), NSW Department of Education (SERAP no. 2019006), University of Queensland (2019000037), Curtin University (HRE2019-0083) and relevant Catholic school committees. Results will be presented to schools and findings disseminated via peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences. This will be the first evaluation of an eHealth intervention, spanning both universal and selective prevention, to simultaneously target six key lifestyle risk factors among adolescents.

There is a lack of interventions and evidence-based interventions aiming to reduce depressive symptoms in patients with severe somatic conditions. The aim of the NEVERMIND project is to address these issues and provide evidence by testing the NEVERMIND system, designed to reduce and prevent depressive symptoms in comparison to treatment as usual. METHODS: The NEVERMIND study is a parallel-groups, pragmatic randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of the NEVERMIND system in reducing depressive symptoms among individuals with severe somatic conditions. The NEVERMIND system comprises a smart shirt and a user interface, in the form of a mobile application. The system is a real-time decision support system, aiming to predict the severity and onset of depressive symptoms by modelling the well-being condition of patients based on physiological data, body movement, and the recurrence of social interactions. The study includes 330 patients who have a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney failure, or lower limb amputation. Participants are randomised in blocks of ten to either the NEVERMIND intervention or treatment as usual as the control group. Clinical interviews and structured questionnaires are administered at baseline, at 12 weeks, and 24 weeks to assess whether the NEVERMIND system is superior to treatment as usual. The endpoint of primary interest is Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) at 12 weeks defined as (i) the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the BDI-II. Secondary outcomes include prevention of the onset of depressive symptoms, changes in quality of life, perceived stigma, and self-efficacy. DISCUSSION: There is a lack of evidence-based interventions aiming to reduce and prevent depressive symptoms in patients with severe somatic conditions. If the NEVERMIND system is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to attend to depressive symptoms in patients with severe somatic conditions.

However, recent reviews include few studies from Asia, despite it being home to over 60% of the world population. The aim is to map the current evidence for mHealth interventions targeting movement behaviors in Asia. Six databases were searched up until August 2021. Included studies described an mHealth intervention targeting one or more movement behaviors, delivered in a country/territory in Asia, to a general population. A total of 3986 unique records were screened for eligibility in duplicate. Eighty studies with 1,413,652 participants were included. Most were randomized (38.8%) or quasi-experimental (27.5%) trials. Studies were from 17 countries/territories (out of 55); majority were high- (65.0%) or upper middle-income (28.7%). Physical activity was targeted most often (93.8%), few targeted sedentary behavior (7.5%), or sleep (8.8%). Most targeted one movement behavior (90.0%), and none targeted all three together. Interventions typically incorporated a single mHealth component (70.0%; app, pedometer, text messages, wearable) and were delivered remotely (66.3%). The average intervention length was 121.8 (SD 127.6) days. mHealth interventions in Asia have primarily targeted physical activity in high- and upper middle-income countries. There are few interventions targeting sedentary behavior or sleep, and no interventions in low-income countries."
Co-design of digital health interventions with young people: A scoping review,"Malloy J, Partridge SR, Kemper JA, Braakhuis A, Roy R.",Digit Health. 2023 Dec 11;9:20552076231219117. doi: 10.1177/20552076231219117. eCollection 2023 Jan-Dec.,Malloy J,Digit Health,2023,2023/12/18,PMC10722957,,10.1177/20552076231219117,"INTRODUCTION: Innovative health promotion strategies are crucial for enhancing global quality of life and curbing premature deaths. Digital health promotion is particularly impactful for young individuals often using internet-connected devices. Collaborative methodologies in digital intervention research offer insights into supporting youth during key life stages, such as adolescence. This review sought to examine the literature on digital health interventions for youth co-designed via participatory frameworks. METHODS: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual and an adapted Arksey & O'Malley's 6-stage framework, this review utilised the PRISMA-ScR checklist for structured reporting. Peer-reviewed research where young individuals (15-35 years) contributed to digital health intervention design was analysed. Systematic synthesis adhered to Braun & Clarke's Thematic Analysis Guidelines, mapping data to research queries and thematic framework. RESULTS: Eighteen articles were systematically synthesised, revealing seven main themes: digital tool, inquiry field, report aim, participatory activities, intervention attributes and behavioural change support. Seventeen distinctive digital health interventions were assessed, mostly within risk mitigation and mental health domains. Predominantly, interventions were web-based, with mental wellness websites emerging as the prevalent tool. User experience testing stood out as the primary reported outcome. CONCLUSION: Several innovative digital health interventions targeting youth have been identified. Platforms including social media, specialised apps, websites and video games are instrumental for health advice and clinical support dissemination, overcoming access and cost barriers. Participatory techniques are integral for the efficacy of digital health resources, encompassing youth aspirations and anticipations. Continued efforts will enrich comprehension of optimal practices in digital health promotion and intervention formulation."

Environmental health behaviors can prevent and protect mothers and their babies' environmental health. METHODS/DESIGN: This study presents a protocol for a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of a mobile application named ""DECO-MOM"" (Deep ECOlogy-MOM) for pregnant women. This application contains content related to environmental perceptions and behaviors according to the revised protection motivation theory. The mobile intervention will be implemented for 4 weeks for 40 pregnant women with a gestational age in the first trimester. As the control group, 40 pregnant women will be recruited at public healthcare centers in Chuncheon and Gongju in South Korea. The hypothesis is that the experimental group will have higher scores for environmental perceptions and behaviors than the control group. An online survey administered before and after the intervention will contain outcome parameters including depression, stress, quality of life, e-learning satisfaction, environmental perceptions, and environmental behaviors. DISCUSSION: This study will elaborate a guide for an intervention to enhance the effects of the mobile application on strengthening environmental health perceptions, behaviors, e-learning satisfaction, and quality of life and curtailing depression and stress among pregnant women.

Digital Tools to Ameliorate Psychological Symptoms Associated With COVID-19: Scoping Review,"Zhang M, Smith HE.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Aug 21;22(8):e19706. doi: 10.2196/19706.,Zhang M,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/07/30,PMC7446713,,10.2196/19706,"BACKGROUND: In the four months after the discovery of the index case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several studies highlighted the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline health care workers and on members of the general public. It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020. The following search strings were used: ""NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus OR COVID19 OR COVID"" and ""mHealth OR eHealth OR text"". Another search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google) was used to identify if the cited web-based interventions could be accessed. A mobile app search engine, App Annie, was used to determine if the identified mobile apps were commercially available. Results: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological distress. Digital tools that are commercially available may be useful for at-risk individuals or individuals with pre-existing psychiatric symptoms."
Analysis of Effectiveness and Psychological Techniques Implemented in mHealth Solutions for Middle-Aged and Elderly Adults with Type 2 Diabetes: A Narrative Review of the Literature,"Vázquez-de Sebastián J, Ciudin A, Castellano-Tejedor C.",J Clin Med. 2021 Jun 18;10(12):2701. doi: 10.3390/jcm10122701.,Vázquez-de Sebastián J,J Clin Med,2021,2021/07/02,PMC8235068,,10.3390/jcm10122701,"BACKGROUND: in diabetes, multiple mHealth solutions were produced and implemented for self-management behaviors. However, little research on the effectiveness of psychological techniques implemented within these mHealth solutions was carried out, and even less with the elderly population where technological barriers might exist. Reliable evidence generated through a comprehensive evaluation of mHealth interventions may accelerate its growth for successful long-term implementation and to help to experience mHealth benefits in an enhanced way in all ages. OBJECTIVE: this study aimed to review mHealth solutions for diabetes self-management in older adults (adherence to treatments and glycemic control) by analyzing the effectiveness of specific psychological techniques implemented. METHODS: a narrative review was conducted following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed (Medline) and American Psychological Association (APA) PsycInfo databases were searched for published papers that addressed eHealth solutions' effectiveness for diabetes self-management. Studies in English, Spanish, and/or German of any design were screened, with no time constraints regarding the year of publication. A qualitative analysis of the selected papers was conducted in several steps. RESULTS: this review found 38 studies setting up and analyzing mHealth solutions for older adults. Most research showed improvements in HbA1c, self-management behaviors, and medication adherence in T2DM patients post intervention. However, different mid-to-long term effects were found across studies, specifically concerning the maintenance and adherence to healthy behaviors. The most employed psychological framework was CBT, including techniques such as self-monitoring of outcome behaviors (mostly targeting glycemia measurements and healthy habits as physical activity and/or diet), tailored motivational feedback from medical staff, and psychoeducation or health coaches. The most successful mHealth intervention combined the feature of tailored feedback messages, interactive communication with healthcare professionals, and multifaceted functions. CONCLUSIONS: there is a lack of elaborate and detailed information in the literature regarding the factors considered in the design and development of mHealth solutions used as interventions for T2DM self-management in the elderly. Documentation and inclusion of such vital information will foster a transparent and shared decision-making process that will ultimately lead to the development of useful and user-friendly self-management apps that can enhance the quality of life for diabetes patients. Further research adapting mHealth solutions to older adults' sensory deficits is necessary."

Web-based physical activity interventions hold much promise to reach older adults. Preliminary evidence suggests that web-based interventions with tailored advice and Fitbits may be well suited for older adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study aims to test the effectiveness of 'Active for Life', a 12-week computer-tailored web-based physical activity intervention using Fitbits for older adults. We will recruit 300 participants who will be randomly assigned to one of three trial arms: (1) web-based physical activity intervention with tailored advice only, (2) web-based physical activity intervention with tailored advice and Fitbit or (3) a wait-list control. The primary outcome, objective moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and secondary outcomes of objective sedentary behaviour, objective sleep, quality of life, social support, physical function and satisfaction with life will be assessed at baseline and week 12. The secondary outcomes of self-reported physical activity, sitting time and sleep will be assessed at baseline, week 6, 12 and 24. Website usability and participant satisfaction will be assessed at week 12 and website usage and intervention fidelity will be assessed from week 1 to 24. Intention-to-treat linear mixed model analyses will be used to test for group (tailoring only, tailoring +Fitbit, control) differences on changes in the main outcome, MVPA and secondary outcomes. Generalised linear models will be used to compare intervention groups (tailoring only, tailoring +Fitbit) on website usability, participant satisfaction, website usage and intervention fidelity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received ethics approval from the Central Queensland University Human Research Ethics Committee (H16/12-321).

Benefits of Digital Health Resources for Substance Use Concerns in Women: Scoping Review,"Quilty L, Agic B, Coombs M, Kristy BL, Shakespeare J, Spafford A, Besa R, Dematagoda S, Patel A, Persaud R, Buckley L.",JMIR Ment Health. 2021 Jun 7;8(6):e25952. doi: 10.2196/25952.,Quilty L,JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021/06/07,PMC8218208,,10.2196/25952,"BACKGROUND: Digital health resources are being increasingly used to support women with substance use concerns. Although empirical research has demonstrated that these resources have promise, the available evidence for their benefit in women requires further investigation. Evidence supports the capacity of interventions that are sex-, gender-, and trauma-informed to improve treatment access and outcomes and to reduce health system challenges and disparities. Indeed, both sex- and gender-specific approaches are critical to improve health and gender equity. Violence and trauma are frequent among those with substance use concerns, but they disproportionately affect those who identify as female or women, further underscoring the need for trauma-informed care as well. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy or effectiveness of online or mobile interventions for risky or harmful substance use in adults who identify as female or women, or who report a history of trauma. METHODS: This scoping review is based on an academic search in MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL, as well as a grey literature search in US and Canadian government and funding agency websites. Of the 7807 records identified, 465 remained following title and abstract screening. Of these, 159 met all eligibility criteria and were reviewed and synthesized. RESULTS: The 159 records reflected 141 distinct studies and 125 distinct interventions. Investigations and the interventions evaluated predominantly focused on alcohol use or general substance use. Evaluated digital health resources included multisession and brief-session interventions, with a wide range of therapeutic elements. Multisession online and mobile interventions exhibited beneficial effects in 86.1% (105/122) of studies. Single-session interventions similarly demonstrated beneficial effects in 64.2% (43/67) of study conditions. Most investigations did not assess gender identity or conduct sex- or gender-based analyses. Only 13 investigations that included trauma were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the overall promise of digital health interventions for substance use concerns, direct or quantitative evidence on the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions in females or women specifically is weak."
BLEND-A: blending internet treatment into conventional face-to-face treatment for alcohol use disorder - a study protocol,"Mellentin AI, Behrendt S, Bilberg R, Blankers M, Folker MP, Tarp K, Uffelmann J, Nielsen AS.",BMC Psychiatry. 2021 Mar 6;21(1):131. doi: 10.1186/s12888-021-03122-4.,Mellentin AI,BMC Psychiatry,2021,2021/03/07,PMC7937233,,10.1186/s12888-021-03122-4,"BACKGROUND: A major challenge to psychological treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) is patient non-compliance. A promising new treatment approach that is hypothesized to increase patient compliance is blended treatment, consisting of face-to-face contact with a therapist combined with modules delivered over the internet within the same protocol. While this treatment concept has been developed and proven effective for a variety of mental disorders, it has not yet been examined for AUD. AIMS: The study described in this protocol aims to examine and evaluate patient compliance with blended AUD treatment as well as the clinical and cost effectiveness of such treatment compared to face-to-face treatment only. METHODS: The study design is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. The included outpatient institutions (planned number of patients: n = 1800) will be randomized in clusters to implement either blended AUD treatment or face-to-face treatment only, i.e. treatment as usual (TAU). Both treatment approaches consist of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy. Data on sociodemographics, treatment (e.g. intensity, duration), type of treatment conclusion (compliance vs. dropout), alcohol consumption, addiction severity, consequences of drinking, and quality of life, will be collected at treatment entry, at treatment conclusion, and 6 months after treatment conclusion. The primary outcome is compliance at treatment conclusion, and the secondary outcomes include alcohol consumption and quality of life at six-months follow-up. Data will be analyzed with an Intention-to-treat approach by means of generalized linear mixed models with a random effect for cluster and fixed effect for each step. Also, analyses evaluating cost-effectiveness will be conducted. DISCUSSION: Blended treatment may increase treatment compliance and thus improve treatment outcomes due to increased flexibility of the treatment course. Since this study is conducted within an implementation framework it can easily be scaled up, and when successful, blended treatment has the potential to become an alternative offer in many outpatient clinics nationwide and internationally.

Efficacy of eHealth Technologies on Medication Adherence in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Bhagavathula AS, Aldhaleei WA, Atey TM, Assefa S, Tesfaye W.",JMIR Cardio. 2023 Dec 19;7:e52697. doi: 10.2196/52697.,Bhagavathula AS,JMIR Cardio,2023,2023/12/19,PMC10762619,,10.2196/52697,"BACKGROUND: Suboptimal adherence to cardiac pharmacotherapy, recommended by the guidelines after acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been recognized and is associated with adverse outcomes. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that eHealth technologies are useful in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. However, little is known about the effect of eHealth interventions on medication adherence in patients following ACS. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of the eHealth interventions on medication adherence to selected 5 cardioprotective medication classes in patients with ACS. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted between May and October 2022, with an update in October 2023 to identify RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of eHealth technologies, including texting, smartphone apps, or web-based apps, to improve medication adherence in patients after ACS. The risk of bias was evaluated using the modified Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs. A pooled meta-analysis was performed using a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model and assessed the medication adherence to the medications of statins, aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers. RESULTS: We identified 5 RCTs, applicable to 4100 participants (2093 intervention vs 2007 control), for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In patients who recently had an ACS, compared to the control group, the use of eHealth intervention was not associated with improved adherence to statins at different time points (risk difference [RD] -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03 at 6 months and RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.02 at 12 months), P2Y12 inhibitors (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02 and RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02), aspirin (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.07 and RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.06), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.02 and RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.05), and beta-blockers (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03 and RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03). The intervention was also not associated with improved adherence irrespective of the adherence assessment method used (self-report or objective). CONCLUSIONS: This review identified limited evidence on the effectiveness of eHealth interventions on adherence to guideline-recommended medications after ACS. While the pooled analyses suggested a lack of effectiveness of such interventions on adherence improvement, further studies are warranted to better understand the role of different eHealth approaches in the post-ACS context."
Digital Interventions to Support Population Mental Health in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Review,"Strudwick G, Sockalingam S, Kassam I, Sequeira L, Bonato S, Youssef A, Mehta R, Green N, Agic B, Soklaridis S, Impey D, Wiljer D, Crawford A.",JMIR Ment Health. 2021 Mar 2;8(3):e26550. doi: 10.2196/26550.,Strudwick G,JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021/03/02,PMC7927953,,10.2196/26550,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of negative health related consequences, including impacts on mental health. More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. METHODS: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection. RESULTS: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area."
Considerations and recommendations for mHealth interventions for substance use among Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) individuals: A narrative review of the past 5 years,"Yang MJ, Martínez Ú, Simmons VN, Schabath MB, Vinci C.",Curr Addict Rep. 2023 May 26:1-13. doi: 10.1007/s40429-023-00497-0. Online ahead of print.,Yang MJ,Curr Addict Rep,2023,2023/06/26,PMC10214315,,10.1007/s40429-023-00497-0,"PURPOSEOF REVIEW: The prevalence of problematic substance use is disproportionately higher among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults compared to adults in the general population. mHealth as a treatment modality could reduce barriers to accessing substance use treatments among SGM populations. Through a qualitative literature search, the current narrative review aimed to understand the lived experiences of SGM individuals who use substances and to synthesize recommendations made in the literature to inform future mHealth interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: Positive and negative reinforcement motives were prominent reasons for substance use, which included SGM identity expression and conformity motives. Individual- and system-level treatment barriers included a lack of safe and nonjudgmental environment, shame and stigma, and limited knowledge about treatment options. Barriers were directly linked to the reported substance use treatment needs in this population. SUMMARY: On-demand app features, real-time intervention and assessment, and anonymity should be considered in future mHealth trials.

Efficacy of mHealth Interventions for Improving the Pain and Disability of Individuals With Chronic Low Back Pain: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"de Melo Santana B, Raffin Moura J, Martins de Toledo A, Burke TN, Fernandes Probst L, Pasinato F, Luiz Carregaro R.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Nov 2;11:e48204. doi: 10.2196/48204.,de Melo Santana B,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/11/14,PMC10662677,,10.2196/48204,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain is one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Individuals with chronic conditions have been widely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, mobile health (mHealth) has become popular, mostly due to the widespread use of smartphones. Despite the considerable number of apps for low back pain available in app stores, the effectiveness of these technologies is not established, and there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of the isolated use of mobile apps in the self-management of low back pain. OBJECTIVE: We summarized the evidence on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on pain and disability for individuals with chronic low back pain. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing mHealth to usual care or no intervention. The search terms used were related to low back pain and mHealth. Only randomized controlled trials were included. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability, and the secondary outcome was quality of life. Searches were carried out in the following databases, without date or language restriction: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), the Cochrane Library, and OpenGrey, in addition to article references. The risk of bias was analyzed using the PEDro scale. Data were summarized descriptively and through meta-analysis (pain intensity and disability). In the meta-analysis, eligible studies were combined while considering clinical and methodological homogeneity. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 5 randomized controlled trials were included, totaling 894 participants (447 allocated to the mHealth group and 445 to the usual care group), and they had similar methodological structure and interventions. Follow-up ranged from 6 weeks to 12 months. The studies did not demonstrate significant differences for pain intensity (mean difference -0.86, 95% CI -2.29 to 0.58; P=.15) and disability (standardized mean difference -0.24, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.20; P=.14) when comparing mHealth and usual care. All studies showed biases, with emphasis on nonconcealed allocation and nonblinding of the outcome evaluator. The certainty of evidence was rated as low for the analyzed outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth alone was no more effective than usual care or no treatment in improving pain intensity and disability in individuals with low back pain. Due to the biases found and the low certainty of evidence, the evidence remains inconclusive, and future quality clinical trials are needed."
Social Cognitive Theories and Electronic Health Design: Scoping Review,Grace-Farfaglia P.,JMIR Hum Factors. 2019 Jul 19;6(3):e11544. doi: 10.2196/11544.,Grace-Farfaglia P,JMIR Hum Factors,2019,2019/07/21,PMC6676794,,10.2196/11544,"BACKGROUND: There are several social cognitive theories (SCTs) and models that support platform design in electronic health (eHealth) promotion trials. The rationale for this scoping review was to determine how social design features (informational aid, expressive support, gaming, and tailored content) are used to promote self-efficacy, engagement, knowledge, and behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review a broad spectrum of digital health interventions in the literature seeking trials that use SCTs for the design of eHealth applications. METHODS: The author conducted a systematic scoping review of 161 Web-based health interventions from published randomized clinical trials using 1 or more tools to address the social cognitive determinants in their website design from January 2006 to April 2016. An iterative approach was used in the selection of studies and data extraction. The studies were analyzed for quality and coded for type of social design features employed. RESULTS: Expressive interaction tools were found in 48.6% (54/111) of studies categorized as a strong recommendation by the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. Overall, less than half of the studies addressed participant social support and motivational needs (43.8%). The vast majority of studies (100%) relied on the use of the Web for delivery of informational aid and tailored content for the individual participant (75.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This review fills a research gap by linking social theory to Web strategy to improve the impact and sustainability of eHealth interventions. A Digital Health Intervention Model was developed to provide a framework to enhance future Web-based health intervention design and execution."
"Implementation, efficacy and cost effectiveness of the unified protocol in a blended format for the transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders: a study protocol for a multicentre, randomised, superiority controlled trial in the Spanish National Health System","Osma J, Martínez-García L, Peris-Baquero Ó, Navarro-Haro MV, González-Pérez A, Suso-Ribera C.",BMJ Open. 2021 Dec 31;11(12):e054286. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054286.,Osma J,BMJ Open,2021,2022/01/01,PMC8720993,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054286,"INTRODUCTION: Emotional disorders (EDs) have become the most prevalent psychological disorders in the general population, which has boosted the economic burden associated with their management. Approximately half of the individuals do not receive adequate treatment. Consequently, finding solutions to deliver cost-effective treatments for EDs has become a key goal of today's clinical psychology. Blended treatments, a combination of face-to-face and online interventions, have emerged as a potential solution to the previous. The Unified Protocol for the Transdiagnostic Treatment of EDs (UP) might serve this purpose, as it can be applied to a variety of disorders simultaneously and its manualised format makes it suitable for blended interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a multicentre, randomised, superiority, clinical trial. Participants will be 310 individuals with a diagnosis of an ED. They will be randomised to a treatment as usual (individual cognitive behavioural therapy) or a UP condition in a blended format (face-to-face individual UP +online, app-based UP). Primary outcomes will be ED diagnostic criteria and depression and anxiety symptoms. Cost efficiency of the intervention, app usability, as well as opinion and confidence in the treatment will also be evaluated. Assessment points will include baseline and 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after UP treatment. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received approvals by the Ethics Research Committee of Navarra, Castellon, Euskadi, Castilla y Leon, Extremadura, Lleida and Aragon. The study is currently under an approval process by the Ethics Research Committees of all the remaining collaborating centres. Outcomes will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conference meetings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04304911."

eHealth interventions to facilitate work participation: a scoping review,"Johnsen TL, Johansen T, Momsen AH, Tveito TH, Nielsen CV, Varsi C, Øyeflaten I.",JBI Evid Synth. 2021 Oct;19(10):2739-2759. doi: 10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00433.,Johnsen TL,JBI Evid Synth,2021,2021/07/05,PMC8528131,,10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00433,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to identify studies combining the concepts of eHealth and work participation for sick-listed employees across diagnostic groups in health care and workplace contexts. INTRODUCTION: There is an increased demand for better health care services and technologies, and eHealth is proposed as a useful tool to improve efficiency and reduce costs. eHealth functions at the intersection of medical informatics, public health, and business, and may be a promising solution for managing the process of return to work among employees on sick leave. Assessment of work outcomes is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of health services, and there is a need to map the research literature on existing eHealth interventions to facilitate work participation. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review considered studies combining two core concepts: eHealth and work participation. It considered studies on eHealth interventions for employees (18 to 65 years of age) on sick leave due to any type of diagnosis or disability, conducted by any stakeholder in workplace or health care contexts and in any country. Empirical data from both quantitative and qualitative studies were included. METHODS: Published and unpublished studies from January 1, 2008, to August 21, 2020, written in English were included in this review. The search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, WHO clinical registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov. A three-step search strategy was followed. Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers and undertaken using an extraction tool developed specifically for the scoping review objectives. RESULTS: This review identified 15 studies eligible for inclusion. Four studies delivered the eHealth intervention by telephone, while 10 interventions were web-based. Of the web-based interventions, five had a blended approach, such as website and email support, or website and social media platforms. One study used an app-based intervention. Only eight studies targeted employees sick-listed due to common sick leave diagnoses, such as common mental disorders and musculoskeletal disorders. The workplace context was the target of the eHealth intervention in seven studies, although the intervention was still delivered by health personnel such as therapists or occupational physicians. Collaboration on individual cases between the health professional, employer, and employee to facilitate work participation seemed to be rare. Four studies reported both a theoretical and an empirical base for the intervention used. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated that the use of eHealth interventions to facilitate work participation is limited, and there is a need for future studies on the use of eHealth technology for this purpose. Developing eHealth interventions specifically for populations at risk of long-term sick leave, and encouraging collaboration between all relevant stakeholders, may help improve work participation."
Reducing sedentary time using an innovative mHealth intervention among patients with total knee replacement: Rationale and study protocol,"Pellegrini CA, Lee J, DeVivo KE, Harpine CE, Del Gaizo DJ, Wilcox S.",Contemp Clin Trials Commun. 2021 Jun 18;22:100810. doi: 10.1016/j.conctc.2021.100810. eCollection 2021 Jun.,Pellegrini CA,Contemp Clin Trials Commun,2021,2021/07/01,PMC8239442,,10.1016/j.conctc.2021.100810,"INTRODUCTION: Although knee replacement is effective for improving pain and physical function, subsequent improvements in physical activity typically do not follow. As a result, many patients spend most of their day engaged in sedentary behavior, which may put them at higher risk of experiencing poor function and disability. Intervening on sedentary time, rather than physical activity, may be a more feasible first-step approach for modifying activity-related behaviors in adults who received knee replacement. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the use of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to reduce sedentary time among adults who received a knee replacement at 3 and 6 months after surgery. METHODS: Patients (n = 92) scheduled for knee replacement will be recruited and at 4 weeks after surgery, they will be randomized to either NEAT!2 or Control. NEAT!2 participants will use the NEAT!2 smartphone app, which provides a vibration and/or audible tone to interrupt prolonged bouts of sitting detected from the smartphone's internal accelerometer, until 3 months after surgery. NEAT!2 participants will receive biweekly coaching calls between 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. Control participants will receive an education control app and receive non-intervention calls to assess general surgery recovery. Both groups will receive 3 retention calls between 3 and 6 months. Data collection will occur pre-operatively and at 3 and 6 months after surgery. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will help to determine whether an innovative remotely-delivered, mHealth sedentary reduction intervention can decrease sedentary time in adults after knee replacement."
Study protocol for a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial of the Building Better Caregivers online workshop for rural family/friend caregivers of people living with dementia,"Santoyo-Olsson J, Lorig K, Romo EM, Luzanilla M, Ramirez GA, Cheng J, Chesla C, Covinsky KE, Karliner L, Thompson DG, Fahrenwald N, Yank V.",Contemp Clin Trials. 2022 Oct;121:106903. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2022.106903.

There is an immediate need to identify effective, scalable, and accessible online programs to support rural caregivers' well-being. Building Better Caregivers (BBC), a possible solution, is an asynchronous online 6-week, interactive, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of persons with dementia. This research aims to assess the effectiveness and implementation of the BBC workshop when delivered among rural dementia caregivers in the United States. METHODS: A hybrid effectiveness and implementation trial applying mixed methods will be conducted in collaboration with local, state, and national partnering organizations. Eligible participants live in a rural area of the United States, give care at least 10 h a week for a family member or friend with dementia, and have internet access. Evaluation is based on the RE-AIM framework. Effectiveness outcomes are assessed using a randomized control trial. Caregivers are randomly assigned to the BBC workshop (intervention) or attention control group. Implementation outcomes are assessed using surveys and debriefing interviews from partnering organizations and participants. The study protocol including the study design, methods of recruitment and assessment, and outcomes are described. CONCLUSION: This is the first known study to evaluate both the effectiveness and implementation of a caregiver support intervention under real-world conditions in rural areas. If successful, this online workshop will be a practical and acceptable approach for promoting the health and well-being of geographically isolated rural dementia caregivers."
Evidence-Based Evaluation of eHealth Interventions: Systematic Literature Review,"Enam A, Torres-Bonilla J, Eriksson H.",J Med Internet Res. 2018 Nov 23;20(11):e10971. doi: 10.2196/10971.,Enam A,J Med Internet Res,2018,2018/11/25,PMC6286426,,10.2196/10971,"BACKGROUND: Until now, the use of technology in health care was driven mostly by the assumptions about the benefits of electronic health (eHealth) rather than its evidence. It is noticeable that the magnitude of evidence of effectiveness and efficiency of eHealth is not proportionate to the number of interventions that are regularly conducted. Reliable evidence generated through comprehensive evaluation of eHealth interventions may accelerate the growth of eHealth for long-term successful implementation and help to experience eHealth benefits in an enhanced way. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand how the evidence of effectiveness and efficiency of eHealth can be generated through evaluation. Hence, we aim to discern (1) how evaluation is conducted in distinct eHealth intervention phases, (2) the aspects of effectiveness and efficiency that are typically evaluated during eHealth interventions, and (3) how eHealth interventions are evaluated in practice. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the evaluation methods for eHealth interventions. Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. We searched Google Scholar and Scopus for the published papers that addressed the evaluation of eHealth or described an eHealth intervention study. A qualitative analysis of the selected papers was conducted in several steps. RESULTS: We intended to see how the process of evaluation unfolds in distinct phases of an eHealth intervention. We revealed that in practice and in several conceptual papers, evaluation is performed at the end of the intervention. There are some studies that discuss the importance of conducting evaluation throughout the intervention; however, in practice, we found no case study that followed this. For our second research question, we discovered aspects of efficiency and effectiveness that are proposed to be assessed during interventions. The aspects that were recurrent in the conceptual papers include clinical, human and social, organizational, technological, cost, ethical and legal, and transferability. However, the case studies reviewed only evaluate the clinical and human and social aspects. At the end of the paper, we discussed a novel approach to look into the evaluation. Our intention was to stir up a discussion around this approach with the hope that it might be able to gather evidence in a comprehensive and credible way. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of evidence in eHealth has not been discussed as rigorously as have the diverse evaluation approaches and evaluation frameworks. Further research directed toward evidence-based evaluation can not only improve the quality of intervention studies but also facilitate successful long-term implementation of eHealth in general. We conclude that the development of more robust and comprehensive evaluation of eHealth studies or an improved validation of evaluation methods could ease the transferability of results among similar studies. Thus, the resources can be used for supplementary research in eHealth."

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website interventions on improving blood pressure in adults with hypertension, and to report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from Jan 1, 2009, that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions on reducing blood pressure in adults with hypertension. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint was change in the mean of systolic blood pressure. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane Risk of Bias 2. Data on systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis, and data on reach, uptake and feasibility were summarised narratively. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO CRD42021247845. FINDINGS: Of the 3235 records identified, 29 RCTs from 13 regions (n=7592 participants) were included in the systematic review, and 28 of these RCTs (n=7092 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. 11 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 13 used smartphone applications, and five used websites. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a -3.62 mm Hg (95% CI -5.22 to -2.02) greater reduction in systolic blood pressure, and a -2.45 mm Hg (-3.83 to -1.07) greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure, compared with control group participants. No statistically significant differences between the three different modes of delivery were observed for both the systolic (p=0.73) and the diastolic blood pressure (p=0.80) outcomes. Smartphone application interventions had a statistically significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure (-2.45 mm Hg [-4.15 to -0.74]); however, there were no statistically significant reductions for SMS interventions (-1.80 mm Hg [-4.60 to 1.00]) or website interventions (-3.43 mm Hg [-7.24 to 0.38]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies and the high risk of bias in some, the level of evidence was assigned a low overall score. Interventions were more effective among people with greater severity of hypertension at baseline. SMS interventions reported higher reach and smartphone application studies reported higher uptake, but differences were not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: SMS, smartphone application, and website interventions were associated with statistically and clinically significant systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions, compared with usual care, regardless of the mode of delivery of the intervention. This conclusion is tempered by the considerable heterogeneity of included studies and the high risk of bias in most. Future studies need to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of these interventions, to both further improve their effectiveness as well as increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

Effectiveness of a digital alcohol moderation intervention as an add-on to depression treatment for young adults: study protocol of a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"Schouten MJE, Dekker JJM, de Bruijn TQ, Ebert DD, Koomen LM, Kosterman SLA, Riper H, Schaub MP, Goudriaan AE, Blankers M.",BMC Psychiatry. 2021 May 22;21(1):265. doi: 10.1186/s12888-021-03222-1.,Schouten MJE,BMC Psychiatry,2021,2021/05/23,PMC8140318,,10.1186/s12888-021-03222-1,"BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders and problematic drinking often co-occur, also among young adults. These co-occurring conditions are associated with various negative health outcomes compared to both conditions alone. Early intervention by addressing alcohol use and depressive symptoms simultaneously in the same treatment might improve both conditions. However, evidence on the (cost-) effectiveness of digital combined depression and alcohol interventions for young adults is currently insufficient. We therefore developed an add-on digital alcohol moderation adherence-focussed guided intervention to complement treatment as usual (TAU) for depressive disorders. The digital intervention is a web-app, including 6 modules based on motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy. This study aims to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of a digital alcohol moderation intervention + TAU compared to TAU on alcohol and depression outcomes among young adults with co-occurring depressive disorders and problematic alcohol use. METHODS: One hundred fifty-six participants, aged 18-35 years, with problematic alcohol use and a diagnosed depressive disorder will participate in a pragmatic multicentre two-arm randomized controlled trial. Problematic alcohol use is operationalised as scoring >/=5 for women and >/= 8 for men on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT). Participants will be randomized to either the experimental group (digital alcohol intervention + TAU) or control group (TAU only). Participants will be recruited at three Dutch mental health care centres and through social media. Assessments take place at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomization. The primary outcome is treatment response at 6-month follow-up, operationalized as a composite score that combines alcohol use and depression measures and indicates whether treatment has been successful or not. Secondary outcomes are depressive symptoms and alcohol use (i.e. number of weekly standard drinks and AUDIT score). An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the trial. DISCUSSION: This study evaluates the (cost-) effectiveness of an add-on digital alcohol moderation intervention for young adults who are in treatment for depressive disorders. If proven effective, the digital intervention could be implemented in mental health care and improve treatment for people with co-occurring depressive disorders and problematic alcohol use.

A Digital Mental Health App Incorporating Wearable Biosensing for Teachers of Children on the Autism Spectrum to Support Emotion Regulation: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Palermo EH, Young AV, Deswert S, Brown A, Goldberg M, Sultanik E, Tan J, Mazefsky CA, Brookman-Frazee L, McPartland JC, Goodwin MS, Pennington J, Marcus SC, Beidas RS, Mandell DS, Nuske HJ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Jun 26;12:e45852. doi: 10.2196/45852.,Palermo EH,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/06/26,PMC10337316,,10.2196/45852,"BACKGROUND: As much as 80% of children on the autism spectrum exhibit challenging behaviors (ie, behaviors dangerous to the self or others, behaviors that interfere with learning and development, and behaviors that interfere with socialization) that can have a devastating impact on personal and family well-being, contribute to teacher burnout, and even require hospitalization. Evidence-based practices to reduce these behaviors emphasize identifying triggers (events or antecedents that lead to challenging behaviors); however, parents and teachers often report that challenging behaviors surface with little warning. Exciting recent advances in biometric sensing and mobile computing technology allow the measurement of momentary emotion dysregulation using physiological indexes. OBJECTIVE: We present the framework and protocol for a pilot trial that will test a mobile digital mental health app, the KeepCalm app. School-based approaches to managing challenging behaviors in children on the autism spectrum are limited by 3 key factors: children on the autism spectrum often have difficulties in communicating their emotions; it is challenging to implement evidence-based, personalized strategies for individual children in group settings; and it is difficult for teachers to track which strategies are successful for each child. KeepCalm aims to address those barriers by communicating children's stress to their teachers using physiological signaling (emotion dysregulation detection), supporting the implementation of emotion regulation strategies via smartphone pop-up notifications of top strategies for each child according to their behavior (emotion regulation strategy implementation), and easing the task of tracking outcomes by providing the child's educational team with a tool to track the most effective emotion regulation strategies for that child based on physiological stress reduction data (emotion regulation strategy evaluation). METHODS: We will test KeepCalm with 20 educational teams of students on the autism spectrum with challenging behaviors (no exclusion based on IQ or speaking ability) in a pilot randomized waitlist-controlled field trial over a 3-month period. We will examine the usability, acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of KeepCalm as primary outcomes. Secondary preliminary efficacy outcomes include clinical decision support success, false positives or false negatives of stress alerts, and the reduction of challenging behaviors and emotion dysregulation. We will also examine technical outcomes, including the number of artifacts and the proportion of time children are engaged in high physical movement based on accelerometry data; test the feasibility of our recruitment strategies; and test the response rate and sensitivity to change of our measures, in preparation for a future fully powered large-scale randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The pilot trial will begin by September 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Results will provide key data about important aspects of implementing KeepCalm in preschools and elementary schools and will provide preliminary data about its efficacy to reduce challenging behaviors and support emotion regulation in children on the autism spectrum.

The effect of digital health interventions on postpartum depression or anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Lewkowitz AK, Whelan AR, Ayala NK, Hardi A, Stoll C, Battle CL, Tuuli MG, Ranney ML, Miller ES.",Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2024 Jan;230(1):12-43. doi: 10.1016/j.ajog.2023.06.028. Epub 2023 Jun 15.,Lewkowitz AK,Am J Obstet Gynecol,2024,2023/06/17,PMC10721728,NIHMS1910815,10.1016/j.ajog.2023.06.028,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effect of digital health interventions compared with treatment as usual on preventing and treating postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. STUDY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS: The systematic review included full-text randomized controlled trials comparing digital health interventions with treatment as usual for preventing or treating postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two authors independently screened all abstracts for eligibility and independently reviewed all potentially eligible full-text articles for inclusion. A third author screened abstracts and full-text articles as needed to determine eligibility in cases of discrepancy. The primary outcome was the score on the first ascertainment of postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety symptoms after the intervention. Secondary outcomes included screening positive for postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety --as defined in the primary study --and loss to follow-up, defined as the proportion of participants who completed the final study assessment compared with the number of initially randomized participants. For continuous outcomes, the Hedges method was used to obtain standardized mean differences when the studies used different psychometric scales, and weighted mean differences were calculated when studies used the same psychometric scales. For categorical outcomes, pooled relative risks were estimated. RESULTS: Of 921 studies originally identified, 31 randomized controlled trials-corresponding to 5532 participants randomized to digital health intervention and 5492 participants randomized to treatment as usual-were included. Compared with treatment as usual, digital health interventions significantly reduced mean scores ascertaining postpartum depression symptoms (29 studies: standardized mean difference, -0.64 [95% confidence interval, -0.88 to -0.40]; I(2)=94.4%) and postpartum anxiety symptoms (17 studies: standardized mean difference, -0.49 [95% confidence interval, -0.72 to -0.25]; I(2)=84.6%). In the few studies that assessed screen-positive rates for postpartum depression (n=4) or postpartum anxiety (n=1), there were no significant differences between those randomized to digital health intervention and treatment as usual. Overall, those randomized to digital health intervention had 38% increased risk of not completing the final study assessment compared with those randomized to treatment as usual (pooled relative risk, 1.38 [95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.62]), but those randomized to app-based digital health intervention had similar loss-to-follow-up rates as those randomized to treatment as usual (relative risk, 1.04 [95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.19]). CONCLUSION: Digital health interventions modestly, but significantly, reduced scores assessing postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety symptoms. More research is needed to identify digital health interventions that effectively prevent or treat postpartum depression and postpartum anxiety but encourage ongoing engagement throughout the study period."
Effects of Increased Standing and Light-Intensity Physical Activity to Improve Postprandial Glucose in Sedentary Office Workers: Protocol for a Randomized Crossover Trial,"Wilson SL, Crosley-Lyons R, Junk J, Hasanaj K, Larouche ML, Hollingshead K, Gu H, Whisner C, Sears DD, Buman MP.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Aug 23;12:e45133. doi: 10.2196/45133.,Wilson SL,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/08/23,PMC10483290,,10.2196/45133,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged bouts of sedentary time, independent from the time spent in engaging in physical activity, significantly increases cardiometabolic risk. Nonetheless, the modern workforce spends large, uninterrupted portions of the day seated at a desk. Previous research suggests-via improved cardiometabolic biomarkers-that this risk might be attenuated by simply disrupting sedentary time with brief breaks of standing or moving. However, this evidence is derived from acute, highly controlled laboratory experiments and thus has low external validity. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate if similar or prolonged cardiometabolic changes are observed after a prolonged (2-week) practice of increased brief standing and moving behaviors in real-world office settings. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial, called the WorkWell Study, will compare the efficacy of two 2-week pilot intervention conditions designed to interrupt sitting time in sedentary office workers (N=15) to a control condition. The intervention conditions use a novel smartphone app to deliver real-time prompts to increase standing (STAND) or moving (MOVE) by an additional 6 minutes each hour during work. Our primary aim is to assess intervention-associated improvements to daily postprandial glucose using continuous glucose monitors. Our secondary aim is to determine whether the interventions successfully evoke substantive positional changes and light-intensity physical activity (LPA). Other outcomes include the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention conditions, fasting blood glucose concentration, femoral artery flow-mediated dilation (f-FMD), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. RESULTS: The trial is ongoing at the time of submission. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a novel, randomized crossover trial designed to extend a laboratory-based controlled study design into the free-living environment. By using digital health technologies to monitor and prompt participants in real time, we will be able to rigorously test the effects of breaking up sedentary behavior over a longer period of time than is seen in traditional laboratory-based studies. Our innovative approach will leverage the strengths of highly controlled laboratory and free-living experiments to achieve maximal internal and external validity. The research team's multidisciplinary expertise allows for a broad range of biological measures to be sampled, providing robust results that will extend knowledge of both the acute and chronic real-life effects of increased standing and LPA in sedentary office workers. The WorkWell Study uses a rigorous transdisciplinary protocol that will contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the beneficial effects of breaking up sitting behavior.

Co-design of Digital Health Interventions for Young Adults: Protocol for a Scoping Review,"Malloy JA, Partridge SR, Kemper JA, Braakhuis A, Roy R.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Oct 24;11(10):e38635. doi: 10.2196/38635.,Malloy JA,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/10/24,PMC9641514,,10.2196/38635,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions, including apps and web-based services, are on the rise due to their facilitated access to target groups. The constant evolution of technology calls for participatory research methodologies to understand youth expectations and the use of technology. The creative and collaborative nature of co-design allows for the active integration of youth desires and may enhance acceptability when it comes to digital health tools. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review is to assess the breadth of literature on digital health interventions that have been co-designed for and by young adults, including the types of available evidence, the identification of key characteristics relevant to young adult co-design, and the examination of research conduct in this space. METHODS: The proposed scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Manual for Scoping Reviews. As well as the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist for reporting scoping reviews, an adaptation of Arksey and O'Malley's 6-stage framework for scoping reviews will be referenced. Peer-reviewed primary research, where young adults (aged 15-35 years) were actively involved in the design and development process of digital health interventions, will be collated for analyses. Five databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane, CINAHL Plus, Google Scholar, and Scopus, will be searched for relevant papers. Search strategies will be comprehensive to identify both published and unpublished literature. Relevant gray literature and secondary research will be excluded but pooled for separate analysis and citation chaining. Results will be presented in one or multiple forms, including narrative, tabular, or diagrammatic. RESULTS: Data collection commenced in October 2021. Following data extraction according to the JBI results extraction instrument and independent quality assurance of included studies, a narrative synthesis of each paper included in the final pool will allow for data charting. As of May 2022, 19 papers are included for analysis. We expect the results to be published by autumn 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol provides guidance for researchers who plan to conduct a similar style of investigation and promotes standardization of the scoping review process. We anticipate the provision of an overview of participatory digital health research involving young adults, highlighting any gaps in this research area, as well as potential areas for further study.

One way to expand psycho-oncological support is through digital interventions. This protocol describes the development and structure of a web-based psycho-oncological intervention, the Make It Training optimized. This intervention is currently evaluated in the Reduct trial, a multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The Make It Training optimized was developed in six steps: A patient need and demand assessment, development and acceptability analysis of a prototype, the formation of a patient advisory council, the revision of the training, implementation into a web app, and the development of a motivation and evaluation plan. RESULTS: Through a process of establishing cancer-affected patients' needs, prototype testing, and patient involvement, the Make It Training optimized was developed by a multidisciplinary team and implemented in a web app. It consists of 16 interactive self-guided modules which can be completed within 16 weeks. DISCUSSION: Intervention protocols can increase transparency and increase the likelihood of developing effective web-based interventions. This protocol describes the process and results of developing a patient-oriented intervention. Future research should focus on the further personalization of web-based psycho-oncological interventions and the potential benefits of combining multiple psychotherapeutic approaches."
Adherence to eHealth-Delivered Exercise in Adults with no Specific Health Conditions: A Scoping Review on a Conceptual Challenge,"Fuente-Vidal A, Guerra-Balic M, Roda-Noguera O, Jerez-Roig J, Montane J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Aug 17;19(16):10214. doi: 10.3390/ijerph191610214.,Fuente-Vidal A,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022,2022/08/26,PMC9408657,,10.3390/ijerph191610214,"Adherence has emerged as a focal point and critical determinant of success for physical activity interventions. The term is used for both traditional and digital interventions, and for prescribed and nonprescribed activities. Many other terms for adherence are being used interchangeably, as there is no consensus on its precise conceptualization. This scoping review aimed to advance the definition of adherence to eHealth programs, specifically for the adult population with no specific health conditions. A total of 2983 papers, published between 1 January 2016 and 13 March 2022, were retrieved from different databases (including grey literature). Of those, 13 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included for review. The selected studies used a wide array of technologies and consisted mainly of exercise interventions. Most of the reviewed publications contemplated exercise adherence as a percentage of expected dose. Most (8 out of 13) studies neither assessed nor specified an expected use of the involved technology. Results suggest a need for homogeneity in the conceptualization of adherence to physical activity and exercise, including those interventions delivered digitally."
Developing a Smartphone-Based Adjunct Intervention to Reduce Cannabis Use Among Juvenile Justice-Involved Adolescents: Protocol for a Multiphase Study,"Helseth SA, Guigayoma J, Price D, Spirito A, Clark MA, Barnett NP, Becker SJ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Mar 11;11(3):e35402. doi: 10.2196/35402.,Helseth SA,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/03/11,PMC8957005,,10.2196/35402,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents involved in the juvenile justice system who use cannabis are at an increased risk of future substance use disorders and rearrest. Many court-involved, nonincarcerated (CINI) youth are referred for services in the community and often encounter multiple barriers to care, highlighting the need for minimally burdensome services that can be delivered in justice settings. Digital health interventions are accessible, easy to implement, and can provide ongoing support but have not been developed to address the unique needs of CINI youth who use cannabis. OBJECTIVE: This multiphase study will aim to develop, implement, and pilot test a novel smartphone app, Teen Empowerment through Computerized Health (TECH), to reduce cannabis and other substance use among CINI youth. TECH is conceptualized as a digital adjunct to a brief computerized intervention delivered by our family court partner. METHODS: Following the principles of user-centered design, phase I interviews with CINI youth aged 14-18 years (n=14-18), their caregivers (n=6-8), and behavioral health app developers (n=6-8) will guide the TECH design decisions. Next, in phase II, CINI youth (n=10) will beta test the TECH app prototype for 1 month; their feedback regarding feasibility and acceptability will directly inform the app refinement process. Finally, in phase III, CINI youth (n=60) will participate in a pilot randomized controlled trial for 6 months, comparing the preliminary effectiveness of the adjunctive TECH app on cannabis use outcomes. RESULTS: Phase I data collection began in September 2020 and was completed in December 2021; 14 CINI youth, 8 caregivers, and 11 behavioral health app developers participated in the study. Phases II and III will occur in 2022 and 2023 and 2023 and 2025, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This body of work will provide insight into the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone-based adjunctive intervention designed for CINI youth. Phase III results will offer a preliminary indication of the effectiveness of the TECH app in reducing cannabis use among CINI youth.

Online ahead of print.,Hicks LJ,J Telemed Telecare,2024,2024/04/08,,,10.1177/1357633X241239715,"Past research has examined available literature on electronic mental health interventions for Indigenous youth with mental health concerns. However, as there have recently been increases in both the number of studies examining electronic mental health interventions and the need for such interventions (i.e. during periods of pandemic isolation), the present systematic review aims to provide an updated summary of the available peer-reviewed and grey literature on electronic mental health interventions applicable to Indigenous youth. The purpose of this review is to better understand the processes used for electronic mental health intervention development. Among the 48 studies discussed, smoking cessation and suicide were the most commonly targeted mental health concerns in interventions. Text message and smartphone application (app) interventions were the most frequently used delivery methods. Qualitative, quantitative, and/or mixed outcomes were presented in several studies, while other studies outlined intervention development processes or study protocols, indicating high activity in future electronic mental health intervention research. Among the findings, common facilitators included the use of community-based participatory research approaches, representation of culture, and various methods of motivating participant engagement. Meanwhile, common barriers included the lack of necessary resources and limits on the amount of support that online interventions can provide. Considerations regarding the standards and criteria for the development of future electronic mental health interventions for Indigenous youth are offered and future research directions are discussed."
mHealth for Integrated People-Centred Health Services in the Western Pacific: A Systematic Review,"Godinho MA, Jonnagaddala J, Gudi N, Islam R, Narasimhan P, Liaw ST.",Int J Med Inform. 2020 Oct;142:104259. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104259. Epub 2020 Aug 19.,Godinho MA,Int J Med Inform,2020,2020/08/29,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104259,"OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to examine how mobile health (mHealth) to support integrated people-centred health services has been implemented and evaluated in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR). METHODS: Eight scientific databases were searched. Two independent reviewers screened the literature in title and abstract stages, followed by full-text appraisal, data extraction, and synthesis of eligible studies. Studies were extracted to capture details of the mhealth tools used, the service issues addressed, the study design, and the outcomes evaluated. We then mapped the included studies using the 20 sub-strategies of the WHO Framework on Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS); as well as with the RE-AIM (Reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework, to understand how studies implemented and evaluated interventions. RESULTS: We identified 39 studies, predominantly from Australia (n = 16), China (n = 7), Malaysia (n = 4) and New Zealand (n = 4), and little from low income countries. The mHealth modalities included text messaging, voice and video communication, mobile applications and devices (point-of-care, GPS, and Bluetooth). Health issues addressed included: medication adherence, smoking cessation, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, asthma, diabetes, and lifestyle activities respectively. Almost all were community-based and focused on service issues; only half were disease-specific. mHealth facilitated integrated IPCHS by: enabling citizens and communities to bypass gatekeepers and directly access services; increasing affordability and accessibility of services; strengthening governance over the access, use, safety and quality of clinical care; enabling scheduling and navigation of services; transitioning patients and caregivers between care sectors; and enabling the evaluation of safety and quality outcomes for systemic improvement. Evaluations of mHealth interventions did not always report the underlying theories. They predominantly reported cognitive/behavioural changes rather than patient outcomes. The utility of mHealth to support and improve IPCHS was evident. However, IPCHS strategy 2 (participatory governance and accountability) was addressed least frequently. Implementation was evaluated in regard to reach (n = 30), effectiveness (n = 24); adoption (n = 5), implementation (n = 9), and maintenance (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: mHealth can transition disease-centred services towards people-centred services. Critical appraisal of studies highlighted methodological issues, raising doubts about validity. The limited evidence for large-scale implementation and international variation in reporting of mHealth practice, modalities used, and health domains addressed requires capacity building. Information-enhanced implementation and evaluation of IPCHS, particularly for participatory governance and accountability, is also important."
Health effects of reduced occupational sedentary behaviour in type 2 diabetes using a mobile health intervention: a study protocol for a 12-month randomized controlled trial-the ROSEBUD study,"Syrjälä MB, Bennet L, Dempsey PC, Fharm E, Hellgren M, Jansson S, Nilsson S, Nordendahl M, Rolandsson O, Rådholm K, Ugarph-Morawski A, Wändell P, Wennberg P.",Trials. 2022 Jul 27;23(1):607. doi: 10.1186/s13063-022-06528-x.,Syrjälä MB,Trials,2022,2022/07/27,PMC9331801,,10.1186/s13063-022-06528-x,"BACKGROUND: Short-term trials conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) showed that reducing sedentary behaviour by performing regular short bouts of light-intensity physical activity enhances health. Moreover, support for reducing sedentary behaviour may be provided at a low cost via mobile health technology (mHealth). There are a wide range of mHealth solutions available including SMS text message reminders and activity trackers that monitor the physical activity level and notify the user of prolonged sitting periods. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a mHealth intervention on sedentary behaviour and physical activity and the associated changes in health in adults with T2DM. METHODS: A dual-arm, 12-month, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted within a nationwide Swedish collaboration for diabetes research in primary health care. Individuals with T2DM (n = 142) and mainly sedentary work will be recruited across primary health care centres in five regions in Sweden. Participants will be randomized (1:1) into two groups. A mHealth intervention group who will receive an activity tracker wristband (Garmin Vivofit4), regular SMS text message reminders, and counselling with a diabetes specialist nurse, or a comparator group who will receive counselling with a diabetes specialist nurse only. The primary outcomes are device-measured total sitting time and total number of steps (activPAL3). The secondary outcomes are fatigue, health-related quality of life and musculoskeletal problems (self-reported questionnaires), number of sick leave days (diaries), diabetes medications (clinical record review) and cardiometabolic biomarkers including waist circumference, mean blood pressure, HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. DISCUSSION: Successful interventions to increase physical activity among those with T2DM have been costly and long-term effectiveness remains uncertain. The use of mHealth technologies such as activity trackers and SMS text reminders may increase awareness of prolonged sedentary behaviour and encourage increase in regular physical activity. mHealth may, therefore, provide a valuable and novel tool to improve health outcomes and clinical management in those with T2DM. This 12-month RCT will evaluate longer-term effects of a mHealth intervention suitable for real-world primary health care settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04219800 .

Investigating Intervention Components and Exploring States of Receptivity for a Smartphone App to Promote Physical Activity: Protocol of a Microrandomized Trial,"Kramer JN, Künzler F, Mishra V, Presset B, Kotz D, Smith S, Scholz U, Kowatsch T.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Jan 31;8(1):e11540. doi: 10.2196/11540.,Kramer JN,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/02/01,PMC6374735,,10.2196/11540,"BACKGROUND: Smartphones enable the implementation of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that tailor the delivery of health interventions over time to user- and time-varying context characteristics. Ideally, JITAIs include effective intervention components, and delivery tailoring is based on effective moderators of intervention effects. Using machine learning techniques to infer each user's context from smartphone sensor data is a promising approach to further enhance tailoring. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to quantify main effects, interactions, and moderators of 3 intervention components of a smartphone-based intervention for physical activity. The secondary objective is the exploration of participants' states of receptivity, that is, situations in which participants are more likely to react to intervention notifications through collection of smartphone sensor data. METHODS: In 2017, we developed the Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally), a chatbot-based mobile health intervention for increasing physical activity that utilizes incentives, planning, and self-monitoring prompts to help participants meet personalized step goals. We used a microrandomized trial design to meet the study objectives. Insurees of a large Swiss insurance company were invited to use the Ally app over a 12-day baseline and a 6-week intervention period. Upon enrollment, participants were randomly allocated to either a financial incentive, a charity incentive, or a no incentive condition. Over the course of the intervention period, participants were repeatedly randomized on a daily basis to either receive prompts that support self-monitoring or not and on a weekly basis to receive 1 of 2 planning interventions or no planning. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire at baseline and postintervention follow-up. RESULTS: Data collection was completed in January 2018. In total, 274 insurees (mean age 41.73 years; 57.7% [158/274] female) enrolled in the study and installed the Ally app on their smartphones. Main reasons for declining participation were having an incompatible smartphone (37/191, 19.4%) and collection of sensor data (35/191, 18.3%). Step data are available for 227 (82.8%, 227/274) participants, and smartphone sensor data are available for 247 (90.1%, 247/274) participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the evidence-based development of a JITAI for increasing physical activity. If components prove to be efficacious, they will be included in a revised version of the app that offers scalable promotion of physical activity at low cost.

Effects of Digital Physical Health Exercises on Musculoskeletal Diseases: Systematic Review With Best-Evidence Synthesis,"Nagel J, Wegener F, Grim C, Hoppe MW.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2024 Jan 23;12:e50616. doi: 10.2196/50616.,Nagel J,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2024,2024/01/23,PMC10848133,,10.2196/50616,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal diseases affect 1.71 billion people worldwide, impose a high biopsychosocial burden on patients, and are associated with high economic costs. The use of digital health interventions is a promising cost-saving approach for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases. As physical exercise is the best clinical practice in the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases, digital health interventions that provide physical exercises could have a highly positive impact on musculoskeletal diseases, but evidence is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of digital physical health exercises on patients with musculoskeletal diseases concerning the localization of the musculoskeletal disease, patient-reported outcomes, and medical treatment types. METHODS: We performed systematic literature research using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The search was conducted using the PubMed, BISp, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist was used to assess the quality of the included original studies. To determine the evidence and direction of the impact of digital physical health exercises, a best-evidence synthesis was conducted, whereby only studies with at least acceptable methodological quality were included for validity purposes. RESULTS: A total of 8988 studies were screened, of which 30 (0.33%) randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 studies (53%) were of acceptable or high quality; they included 1840 patients (1008/1643, 61.35% female; 3 studies including 197 patients did not report gender distribution) with various musculoskeletal diseases. A total of 3 different intervention types (app-based interventions, internet-based exercises, and telerehabilitation) were used to deliver digital physical health exercises. Strong evidence was found for the positive impact of digital physical health exercises on musculoskeletal diseases located in the back. Moderate evidence was found for diseases located in the shoulder and hip, whereas evidence for the entire body was limited. Conflicting evidence was found for diseases located in the knee and hand. For patient-reported outcomes, strong evidence was found for impairment and quality of life. Conflicting evidence was found for pain and function. Regarding the medical treatment type, conflicting evidence was found for operative and conservative therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Strong to moderate evidence was found for a positive impact on musculoskeletal diseases located in the back, shoulder, and hip and on the patient-reported outcomes of impairment and quality of life. Thus, digital physical health exercises could have a positive effect on a variety of symptoms of musculoskeletal diseases."
Current State and Future Directions of Technology-Based Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention for Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review,"Colombo D, Fernández-Álvarez J, Patané A, Semonella M, Kwiatkowska M, García-Palacios A, Cipresso P, Riva G, Botella C.",J Clin Med. 2019 Apr 5;8(4):465. doi: 10.3390/jcm8040465.,Colombo D,J Clin Med,2019,2019/04/10,PMC6518287,,10.3390/jcm8040465,"Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) are alternative approaches to retrospective self-reports and face-to-face treatments, and they make it possible to repeatedly assess patients in naturalistic settings and extend psychological support into real life. The increase in smartphone applications and the availability of low-cost wearable biosensors have further improved the potential of EMA and EMI, which, however, have not yet been applied in clinical practice. Here, we conducted a systematic review, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to explore the state of the art of technology-based EMA and EMI for major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 33 articles were included (EMA = 26; EMI = 7). First, we provide a detailed analysis of the included studies from technical (sampling methods, duration, prompts), clinical (fields of application, adherence rates, dropouts, intervention effectiveness), and technological (adopted devices) perspectives. Then, we identify the advantages of using information and communications technologies (ICTs) to extend the potential of these approaches to the understanding, assessment, and intervention in depression. Furthermore, we point out the relevant issues that still need to be addressed within this field, and we discuss how EMA and EMI could benefit from the use of sensors and biosensors, along with recent advances in machine learning for affective modelling."
"Digital Health Intervention to Increase Health Knowledge Related to Diseases of High Public Health Concern in Iringa, Tanzania: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study","Holst C, Sukums F, Ngowi B, Diep LM, Kebede TA, Noll J, Winkler AS.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Apr 22;10(4):e25128. doi: 10.2196/25128.,Holst C,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/04/22,PMC8103301,,10.2196/25128,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, health promotion and health education have been provided to communities in the global south in the form of leaflets or orally by health care workers. Digital health interventions (DHIs) such as digital health messages accessed by smartphones have the potential to reach more people at a lower cost and to contribute to strengthening of health care systems. The DHI in this study focuses on disseminating digital health education regarding 3 disease complexes of high public health concern: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and Taenia solium (neuro)cysticercosis or taeniasis, a parasitic zoonotic disease that requires a One Health approach. The DHI presents the participants with animated health videos (animations) and provides access to information spots (InfoSpots) with a free-of-charge digital health platform containing messages about health to rural Tanzanian communities. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to measure the effect of the DHI on health knowledge uptake and retention over time in the rural communities. METHODS: This is a mixed methods study including a nonrandomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews conducted in rural Tanzania. A health platform containing digital health messages for the communities was developed prior to the study. The health messages consist of text, pictures, quizzes, and animations of everyday stories, aimed at disease prevention and early treatment. The baseline and immediate postintervention assessments were completed in Iringa, Tanzania in May 2019. The participants were interviewed by enumerators and completed questionnaires regarding health knowledge. Participants in the intervention group were exposed to 3 different health animations once on a tablet device. The participants' health knowledge was assessed again immediately after the exposure. The first follow-up survey was undertaken in August 2019. The InfoSpots with the digital health platform were thereafter launched in the intervention villages in November 2019. Qualitative interviews were undertaken in February 2020. The second follow-up was completed in June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 600 participants have been enrolled in the trial. We will assess (1) the difference in knowledge scores between baseline and the immediate postintervention assessments in the intervention group and (2) the difference in knowledge scores between the intervention and control groups at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-DHI rollout. Since a randomized design did not prove feasible, potential confounders (eg, age, gender, education, and time of exposure) may be introduced, and results will be adjusted. Data analysis for the 35 qualitative interviews is currently ongoing, and perspectives and experiences related to use and nonuse of the InfoSpots are being explored. CONCLUSIONS: The data have been collected, and the analysis is ongoing in this digital health study, aimed at evaluating the effects of a DHI based on relevant health messages. The publications of results can be expected this year. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03808597; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03808597.

Integrating Behavioral Science and Design Thinking to Develop Mobile Health Interventions: Systematic Scoping Review,"Voorheis P, Zhao A, Kuluski K, Pham Q, Scott T, Sztur P, Khanna N, Ibrahim M, Petch J.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 Mar 16;10(3):e35799. doi: 10.2196/35799.,Voorheis P,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/03/16,PMC8968622,,10.2196/35799,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are increasingly being designed to facilitate health-related behavior change. Integrating insights from behavioral science and design science can help support the development of more effective mHealth interventions. Behavioral Design (BD) and Design Thinking (DT) have emerged as best practice approaches in their respective fields. Until now, little work has been done to examine how BD and DT can be integrated throughout the mHealth design process. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review was to map the evidence on how insights from BD and DT can be integrated to guide the design of mHealth interventions. The following questions were addressed: (1) what are the main characteristics of studies that integrate BD and DT during the mHealth design process? (2) what theories, models, and frameworks do design teams use during the mHealth design process? (3) what methods do design teams use to integrate BD and DT during the mHealth design process? and (4) what are key design challenges, implementation considerations, and future directions for integrating BD and DT during mHealth design? METHODS: This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute reviewer manual and PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. Studies were identified from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and JMIR by using search terms related to mHealth, BD, and DT. Included studies had to clearly describe their mHealth design process and how behavior change theories, models, frameworks, or techniques were incorporated. Two independent reviewers screened the studies for inclusion and completed the data extraction. A descriptive analysis was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 75 papers met the inclusion criteria. All studies were published between 2012 and 2021. Studies integrated BD and DT in notable ways, which can be referred to as ""Behavioral Design Thinking."" Five steps were followed in Behavioral Design Thinking: (1) empathize with users and their behavior change needs, (2) define user and behavior change requirements, (3) ideate user-centered features and behavior change content, (4) prototype a user-centered solution that supports behavior change, and (5) test the solution against users' needs and for its behavior change potential. The key challenges experienced during mHealth design included meaningfully engaging patient and public partners in the design process, translating evidence-based behavior change techniques into actual mHealth features, and planning for how to integrate the mHealth intervention into existing clinical systems. CONCLUSIONS: Best practices from BD and DT can be integrated throughout the mHealth design process to ensure that mHealth interventions are purposefully developed to effectively engage users. Although this scoping review clarified how insights from BD and DT can be integrated during mHealth design, future research is needed to identify the most effective design approaches."
A Digital Health Platform for Integrated and Proactive Patient-Centered Multimorbidity Self-management and Care (ProACT): Protocol for an Action Research Proof-of-Concept Trial,"Dinsmore J, Hannigan C, Smith S, Murphy E, Kuiper JML, O'Byrne E, Galvin M, Jacobs A, Sillevis Smitt M, van Leeuwen C, McAleer P, Tompkins L, Brady AM, McCarron M, Doyle J.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Dec 15;10(12):e22125. doi: 10.2196/22125.,Dinsmore J,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/12/16,PMC8717136,,10.2196/22125,"BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is defined as the presence of two or more chronic diseases and associated comorbidities. There is a need to improve best practices around the provision of well-coordinated, person-centered care for persons with multimorbidities. Present health systems across the European Union (EU) focus on supporting a single-disease framework of care; the primary challenge is to create a patient-centric, integrated care ecosystem to understand and manage multimorbidity. ProACT is a large-scale project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme, that involved the design, development, and evaluation of a digital health platform to improve and advance home-based integrated care, and supported self-management, for older adults (aged >/=65 years) living with multimorbidity. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the trial implementation protocol of a proof-of-concept digital health platform (ProACT) in 2 EU member states (Ireland and Belgium) to support older persons with multimorbidities self-managing at home, supported by their care network (CN). METHODS: Research was conducted across 2 EU member states, Ireland and Belgium. A 12-month action research trial design, divided into 3 evaluation cycles and lasting 3 months each, with a reflective redesign and development phase of 1 month after cycles 1 and 2 was conducted. Participants were 120 (60/120, 50% in Ireland and 60/120, 50% in Belgium) older persons with multimorbidities diagnosed with two or more of the following chronic conditions: diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, and cardiovascular diseases. With permission from persons with multimorbidities, members of their CN were invited to participate in the study. Persons with multimorbidities were provided with ProACT technologies (tablet, devices, or sensors) to support them in self-managing their conditions. CN members also received access to an app to remotely support their persons with multimorbidity. Qualitative and quantitative feedback and evaluation data from persons with multimorbidity and CN participants were collected across four time points: baseline (T1), at the end of each 3-month action research cycle (T2 and T3), and in a final posttrial interview (T4). Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative interview data. Quantitative data were analyzed via platform use statistics (to assess engagement) and standardized questionnaires (using descriptive and inferential statistics). This study is approved by the ethics committees of Ireland and Belgium. RESULTS: The trial implementation phase for this 44-month (2016-2019) funded study was April 2018 to June 2019. The trial outcomes are at various stages of publication since 2021. CONCLUSIONS: ProACT aims to co-design and develop a digital intervention with persons with multimorbidities and their CN, incorporating clinical guidelines with the state of the art in human-computer interaction, behavioral science, health psychology, and data analytic methods to deliver a digital health platform to advance self-management of multimorbidity at home, as part of a proactive, integrated model of supported person-centered care.

Are we there yet?!-a literature review of recent digital technology advances for the treatment of early psychosis,"Rus-Calafell M, Schneider S.",Mhealth. 2020 Jan 5;6:3. doi: 10.21037/mhealth.2019.09.14. eCollection 2020.,Rus-Calafell M,Mhealth,2020,2020/03/20,PMC7063271,,10.21037/mhealth.2019.09.14,"Access to psychological interventions during early stages of psychosis is essential for ameliorating outcomes and improving prognosis. However, reaching and engaging individuals at these stages of the illness can be very challenging for early intervention teams. Recent digital technological advances have emerged to overcome some of these challenges and to improve access to psychological interventions. The aim of the present literature review is to summarise main findings of relevant studies published during the last 10 years on the utilization of digital technologies (i.e., virtual reality, smartphone technology and web-based interventions) to enhance psychological treatment outcomes in early psychosis. A literature search from January 2009 to June 2019 was performed to identify relevant papers. Of 1,502 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for the review and only five presented results from finalised trials. Overall, these studies showed positive feasibility and acceptability results, along with preliminary evidence of improved therapy outcomes. The present review offers a state-of-the-art summary of the main features of these user-centered digital interventions for early stages of psychosis and a critical discussion about their future implementation in mental health services."
"The Mobile Health Multiple Lifestyle Behavior Interventions Across the Lifespan (MoBILE) Research Program: Protocol for Development, Evaluation, and Implementation","Bendtsen M, Bendtsen P, Henriksson H, Henriksson P, Müssener U, Thomas K, Löf M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Apr 20;9(4):e14894. doi: 10.2196/14894.,Bendtsen M,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/04/21,PMC7199135,,10.2196/14894,"BACKGROUND: Clustering of multiple lifestyle risk behaviors has been associated with a greater risk of noncommunicable diseases and mortality than one lifestyle risk behavior or no lifestyle risk behaviors. The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden reported in 2018 that it is important to provide additional support to individuals with multiple lifestyle risk behaviors, as risks from these behaviors are multiplicative rather than additive. However, the same report emphasized that there is a lack of knowledge regarding interventions that support changes to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The MoBILE (Mobile health Multiple lifestyle Behavior Interventions across the LifEspan) research program has brought together two Swedish research groups supported by international collaborators. Through this collaboration, we aim to design and evaluate a number of novel and tailored mobile health (mHealth) multiple lifestyle behavior interventions across the life span of different health care populations. In addition, the MoBILE research program will extend ongoing research to include mHealth interventions for migrant pregnant women and children. METHODS: Each project within the MoBILE program will focus on a specific group: pregnant women, preschool children, high school and university students, and adults in primary and clinical care. All the projects will follow the same 4 phases: requirements, development, evaluation, and implementation. During the requirements phase, implementers and end users will aid the design of content and functionality of the interventions. In the development phase, findings from the first phase will be synthesized with expert domain knowledge and theoretical constructs to create interventions tailored to the target groups. The third phase, evaluation, will comprise randomized controlled trials conducted to estimate the effects of the interventions on multiple lifestyle risk behaviors (eg, alcohol, nutrition, physical activity, and smoking). The final phase will investigate how the interventions, if found effective, can be disseminated into different health care contexts. RESULTS: The research program commenced in 2019, and the first results will be available in 2020. Projects involving pregnant women, preschool children, and high school and university students will be completed in the first 3 years, with the remaining projects being planned for the program's final 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The development of evidence-based digital tools is complex, as they should be guided by theoretical frameworks, and requires large interdisciplinary teams with competence in technology, behavioral science, and lifestyle-specific areas. Individual researchers or smaller research groups developing their own tools is not the way forward, as it means reinventing the wheel over and over again. The MoBILE research program therefore aims to join forces and learn from the past 10 years of mHealth research to maximize scientific outcomes, as well as the use of financial resources to expand the growing body of evidence for mHealth lifestyle behavior interventions.

Digital intervention promoting physical activity among obese people (DIPPAO) randomised controlled trial: study protocol,"Mazéas A, Chalabaev A, Blond M, Pereira B, Duclos M.",BMJ Open. 2022 Jun 16;12(6):e058015. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058015.,Mazéas A,BMJ Open,2022,2022/06/16,PMC9204413,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058015,"INTRODUCTION: Physical inactivity and excessive sedentary behaviours are major preventable causes in both the development and the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nevertheless, current programmes struggle to engage and sustain physical activity (PA) of patients over long periods of time. To overcome these limitations, the Digital Intervention Promoting Physical Activity among Obese people randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a group-based digital intervention grounded on gamification strategies, enhanced by social features and informed by the tenets of the self-determination theory and the social identity approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This trial is a two-arm parallel RCT testing the effectiveness of the Kiplin digital intervention on obese and patients with T2DM in comparison to the usual supervised PA programme of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, France. A total of 50 patients will be randomised to one of the two interventions and will follow a 3-month programme with a 6-month follow-up postintervention. The primary outcome of the study is the daily step count change between the baseline assessment and the end of the intervention. Accelerometer data, self-reported PA, body composition and physical capacities will also be evaluated. To advance our understanding of complex interventions like gamified and group-based ones, we will explore several psychological mediators relative to motivation, enjoyment, in-group identification or perceived weight stigma. Finally, to assess a potential superior economic efficiency compared with the current treatment, we will conduct a cost-utility analysis between the two conditions. A mixed-model approach will be used to analyse the change in outcomes over time. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Local Human Protection Committee (CPP Ile de France XI, No 21 004-65219). Results will inform the Kiplin app development, be published in scientific journals and disseminated in international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04887077."
"Effectiveness of Digital Counseling Environments on Anxiety, Depression, and Adherence to Treatment Among Patients Who Are Chronically Ill: Systematic Review","Paalimäki-Paakki K, Virtanen M, Henner A, Nieminen MT, Kääriäinen M.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Jan 6;24(1):e30077. doi: 10.2196/30077.,Paalimäki-Paakki K,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/01/06,PMC8778552,,10.2196/30077,"BACKGROUND: Patients who are chronically ill need novel patient counseling methods to support their self-care at different stages of the disease. At present, knowledge of how effective digital counseling is at managing patients' anxiety, depression, and adherence to treatment seems to be fragmented, and the development of digital counseling will require a more comprehensive view of this subset of interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of digital counseling environments at improving anxiety, depression, and adherence to treatment among patients who are chronically ill. METHODS: Systematic searches of the EBSCO (CINAHL), PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were conducted in May 2019 and complemented in October 2020. The review considered studies that included adult patients aged >/=18 years with chronic diseases; interventions evaluating digital (mobile, web-based, and ubiquitous) counseling interventions; and anxiety, depression, and adherence to treatment, including clinical indicators related to adherence to treatment, as outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using the standardized Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies. As a meta-analysis could not be conducted because of considerable heterogeneity in the reported outcomes, narrative synthesis was used to synthesize the results. RESULTS: Of the 2056 records screened, 20 (0.97%) randomized controlled trials, 4 (0.19%) pilot randomized controlled trials, and 2 (0.09%) quasi-experimental studies were included. Among the 26 included studies, 10 (38%) digital, web-based interventions yielded significantly positive effects on anxiety, depression, adherence to treatment, and the clinical indicators related to adherence to treatment, and another 18 (69%) studies reported positive, albeit statistically nonsignificant, changes among patients who were chronically ill. The results indicate that an effective digital counseling environment comprises high-quality educational materials that are enriched with multimedia elements and activities that engage the participant in self-care. Because of the methodological heterogeneity of the included studies, it is impossible to determine which type of digital intervention is the most effective for managing anxiety, depression, and adherence to treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides compelling evidence that digital, web-based counseling environments for patients who are chronically ill are more effective than, or at least comparable to, standard counseling methods; this suggests that digital environments could complement standard counseling."

Caregiving for a person with cancer can significantly impact caregivers' physical and mental health. Many caregivers feel ill-prepared for this role, especially when care involves complex medical needs accompanied by the psychological challenges experienced following a cancer diagnosis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study employs a convergent, parallel, mixed methods design combining an online survey with an optional interview. Eligible, consenting participants will be invited to participate in a survey to examine (1) participants' unmet needs, (2) challenges experienced throughout the cancer journey, (3) perceived self-efficacy to determine participants' level of confidence in undertaking caregiver tasks, (4) views regarding suitable content to include in a caregiver training intervention, (5) preferred method of intervention delivery (ie, website, smartphone application and/or interactive video), and (6) preferences for the timing of delivery of the intervention content (ie, ability to choose a module, access to the entire content or have a set order in which they receive the information). Caregivers will be eligible to participate if they (1) are male, (2) have previously cared for or are currently caring for a woman with breast cancer, (3) are aged over 18 years, and (4) do not currently suffer from a cognitive impairment or mental health condition (ie, depression, anxiety). Data analysis will include examination of differences in psychological outcomes and needs based on demographic variables, and mediation analysis to explore whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between challenges, unmet needs and distress. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was reviewed and approved by two human research ethics committees within Australia. We anticipate two to three publications may be developed from the study."
Optimizing a Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial,"Goldstein SP, Zhang F, Klasnja P, Hoover A, Wing RR, Thomas JG.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Dec 6;10(12):e33568. doi: 10.2196/33568.,Goldstein SP,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/12/07,PMC8691411,,10.2196/33568,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) is a gold standard approach to weight loss and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, frequent lapses from the recommended diet stymie weight loss and prevent individuals from actualizing the health benefits of BOT. There is a need for innovative treatment solutions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in BOT. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to optimize a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that uses daily surveys to assess triggers for dietary lapses and deliver interventions when the risk of lapse is high. A microrandomized trial design will evaluate the efficacy of any interventions (ie, theory-driven or a generic alert to risk) on the proximal outcome of lapses during BOT, compare the effects of theory-driven interventions with generic risk alerts on the proximal outcome of lapse, and examine contextual moderators of interventions. METHODS: Adults with overweight or obesity and cardiovascular disease risk (n=159) will participate in a 6-month web-based BOT while using the JITAI to prevent dietary lapses. Each time the JITAI detects elevated lapse risk, the participant will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or 1 of 4 theory-driven interventions (ie, enhanced education, building self-efficacy, fostering motivation, and improving self-regulation). The primary outcome will be the occurrence of lapse in the 2.5 hours following randomization. Contextual moderators of intervention efficacy will also be explored (eg, location and time of day). The data will inform an optimized JITAI that selects the theory-driven approach most likely to prevent lapses in a given moment. RESULTS: The recruitment for the microrandomized trial began on April 19, 2021, and is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This study will optimize a JITAI for dietary lapses so that it empirically tailors the provision of evidence-based intervention to the individual and context. The finalized JITAI will be evaluated for efficacy in a future randomized controlled trial of distal health outcomes (eg, weight loss).

User Engagement With Smartphone Apps and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Outcomes: Systematic Review,"Spaulding EM, Marvel FA, Piasecki RJ, Martin SS, Allen JK.",JMIR Cardio. 2021 Feb 3;5(1):e18834. doi: 10.2196/18834.,Spaulding EM,JMIR Cardio,2021,2021/02/03,PMC8411427,,10.2196/18834,"BACKGROUND: The use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions, including smartphone apps, for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has demonstrated mixed results for obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension management. A major factor attributing to the variation in mHealth study results may be mHealth user engagement. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to determine if user engagement with smartphone apps for the prevention and management of CVD is associated with improved CVD health behavior change and risk factor outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases from 2007 to 2020. Studies were eligible if they assessed whether user engagement with a smartphone app used by an individual to manage his or her CVD risk factors was associated with the CVD health behavior change or risk factor outcomes. For eligible studies, data were extracted on study and sample characteristics, intervention description, app user engagement measures, and the relationship between app user engagement and the CVD risk factor outcomes. App user engagement was operationalized as general usage (eg, number of log-ins or usage days per week) or self-monitoring within the app (eg, total number of entries made in the app). The quality of the studies was assessed. RESULTS: Of the 24 included studies, 17 used a randomized controlled trial design, 4 used a retrospective analysis, and 3 used a single-arm pre- and posttest design. Sample sizes ranged from 55 to 324,649 adults, with 19 studies recruiting participants from a community setting. Most of the studies assessed weight loss interventions, with 6 addressing additional CVD risk factors, including diabetes, sleep, stress, and alcohol consumption. Most of the studies that assessed the relationship between user engagement and reduction in weight (9/13, 69%), BMI (3/4, 75%), body fat percentage (1/2, 50%), waist circumference (2/3, 67%), and hemoglobin A(1c) (3/5, 60%) found statistically significant results, indicating that greater app user engagement was associated with better outcomes. Of 5 studies, 3 (60%) found a statistically significant relationship between higher user engagement and an increase in objectively measured physical activity. The studies assessing the relationship between user engagement and dietary and diabetes self-care behaviors, blood pressure, and lipid panel components did not find statistically significant results. CONCLUSIONS: Increased app user engagement for prevention and management of CVD may be associated with improved weight and BMI; however, only a few studies assessed other outcomes, limiting the evidence beyond this. Additional studies are needed to assess user engagement with smartphone apps targeting other important CVD risk factors, including dietary behaviors, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and hypertension. Further research is needed to assess mHealth user engagement in both inpatient and outpatient settings to determine the effect of integrating mHealth interventions into the existing clinical workflow and on CVD outcomes."
The Impact of the mKidney mHealth System on Live Donor Follow-Up Compliance: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Henderson ML, Thomas AG, Eno AK, Waldram MM, Bannon J, Massie AB, Levan MA, Segev DL, Bingaman AW.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Jan 15;8(1):e11000. doi: 10.2196/11000.,Henderson ML,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/01/22,PMC6350092,,10.2196/11000,"BACKGROUND: Every year, more than 5500 healthy people in the United States donate a kidney for the medical benefit of another person. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) requires transplant hospitals to monitor living kidney donors (LKDs) for 2 years postdonation. However, the majority (115/202, 57%) of transplant hospitals in the United States continue to fail to meet nationally mandated requirements for LKD follow-up. A novel method for collecting LKD follow-up is needed to ease both the transplant hospital-level and patient-level burden. We built mKidney-a mobile health (mHealth) system designed specifically to facilitate the collection and reporting of OPTN-required LKD follow-up data. The mKidney mobile app was developed on the basis of input elicited from LKDs, transplant providers, and thought leaders. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the mKidney smartphone app on LKD follow-up rates. METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with LKDs who undergo LKD transplantation at Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. Eligible participants will be recruited in-person by a study team member at their 1-week postdonation clinical visit and randomly assigned to the intervention or control arm (1:1). Participants in the intervention arm will receive the mHealth intervention (mKidney), and participants in the control arm will receive the current standard of follow-up care. Our primary outcome will be policy-defined complete (all components addressed) and timely (60 days before or after the expected visit date) submission of LKD follow-up data at required 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year visits. Our secondary outcome will be hospital-level compliance with OPTN reporting requirements at each visit. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Additionally, we will collect quantitative and qualitative process data regarding the implementation of the mKidney system. RESULTS: We began recruitment for this RCT in May 2018. We plan to enroll 400 LKDs over 2 years and follow participants for the 2-year mandated follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot RCT will evaluate the impact of the mKidney system on rates of LKD and hospital compliance with OPTN-mandated LKD follow-up at a large LKD transplant hospital. It will provide valuable information on strategies for implementing such a system in a clinical setting and inform effect sizes for future RCT sample size calculations.

Online interventions targeting lifestyle changes in adults with type 2 diabetes have provided mixed results. Previous research highlights the importance of creating theory-based interventions adapted to the population's specific needs. The online intervention ""MyPlan 2.0"" targets physical activity and sedentary behavior in adults with type 2 diabetes. This intervention is grounded in the self-regulation framework and, by incorporating the feedback of users with type 2 diabetes, iteratively adapted to its target population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to thoroughly describe ""MyPlan 2.0"" and the study protocol that will be used to test the effectiveness of this intervention to alter patients' levels of physical activity and sedentary behavior. METHODS: A two-arm superiority randomized controlled trial will be performed. Physical activity and sedentary behavior will be measured using accelerometers and questionnaires. Furthermore, using questionnaires and diaries, patients' stressors and personal determinants for change will be explored in depth. To evaluate the primary outcomes of the intervention, multilevel analyses will be conducted. RESULTS: The randomized controlled trial started in January 2018. As participants can start at different moments, we aim to finish all testing by July 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This study will increase our understanding about whether and how a theory-based online intervention can help adults with type 2 diabetes increase their level of physical activity and decrease their sedentary time.

Stress- and smoke free pregnancy study protocol: a randomized controlled trial of a personalized eHealth intervention including heart rate variability-biofeedback to support pregnant women quit smoking via stress reduction,"van Dijk W, Oosterman M, Jansen I, de Vente W, Huizink A.",BMC Public Health. 2021 May 12;21(1):905. doi: 10.1186/s12889-021-10910-w.,van Dijk W,BMC Public Health,2021,2021/05/13,PMC8115871,,10.1186/s12889-021-10910-w,"BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking and stress during pregnancy are associated with adverse health effects for women themselves and are risk factors for adverse developmental outcomes of the unborn child. Smoking and stress seem to be intertwined in various ways. First, the majority of smoking pregnant women is of lower socio-economic status, which is associated with higher levels of perceived stress. Second, smoking women often report to smoke because they feel stressed. Third, quitting smoking often increases perceived stress levels initially. Therefore, effective interventions are needed to support women with smoking cessation by reducing stress. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention on stress reduction and smoking cessation. METHODS/DESIGN: The Stress- and Smoke Free Start of Life (SSFSL) study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a personalized eHealth intervention with a control condition. Inclusion criteria for the women are: (1) > 18 years of age, (2) < 28 weeks pregnant at recruitment, (3) currently smoking. Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive an 8-week intervention delivered on their smartphone. The application includes psycho-education on pregnancy, stress, and smoking (cessation); stress-management training consisting of Heart Rate Variability-biofeedback; and a personalized stop-smoking-plan. Participants in the control condition will be invited to visit a webpage with information on pregnancy, stress, and smoking (cessation). Study outcomes will be collected via online questionnaires, at four timepoints: pre-intervention (baseline; t0), post-intervention (8 weeks + 1 day after t0; t1), follow up at two weeks after birth (t2), and follow up at three months after birth (t3). The primary outcome measure is self-reported smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes include daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked, perceived stress, pregnancy experience, birth outcomes, and negative affectivity scores of the baby. Moreover, the mediating effect of stress reduction on smoking cessation will be examined, and possible moderators will be tested. DISCUSSION: If the eHealth intervention is effective in smoking cessation among pregnant smoking women, it can be implemented as a tool into the health care in the Netherlands.

Smart Devices for Older Adults Managing Chronic Disease: A Scoping Review,"Kim BY, Lee J.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2017 May 23;5(5):e69. doi: 10.2196/mhealth.7141.,Kim BY,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2017,2017/05/25,PMC5461419,,10.2196/mhealth.7141,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of smartphones and tablets featuring vastly advancing functionalities (eg, sensors, computing power, interactivity) has transformed the way mHealth interventions support chronic disease management for older adults. Baby boomers have begun to widely adopt smart devices and have expressed their desire to incorporate technologies into their chronic care. Although smart devices are actively used in research, little is known about the extent, characteristics, and range of smart device-based interventions. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a scoping review to (1) understand the nature, extent, and range of smart device-based research activities, (2) identify the limitations of the current research and knowledge gap, and (3) recommend future research directions. METHODS: We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. We identified relevant studies from MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases using search terms related to mobile health, chronic disease, and older adults. Selected studies used smart devices, sampled older adults, and were published in 2010 or after. The exclusion criteria were sole reliance on text messaging (short message service, SMS) or interactive voice response, validation of an electronic version of a questionnaire, postoperative monitoring, and evaluation of usability. We reviewed references. We charted quantitative data and analyzed qualitative studies using thematic synthesis. To collate and summarize the data, we used the chronic care model. RESULTS: A total of 51 articles met the eligibility criteria. Research activity increased steeply in 2014 (17/51, 33%) and preexperimental design predominated (16/50, 32%). Diabetes (16/46, 35%) and heart failure management (9/46, 20%) were most frequently studied. We identified diversity and heterogeneity in the collection of biometrics and patient-reported outcome measures within and between chronic diseases. Across studies, we found 8 self-management supporting strategies and 4 distinct communication channels for supporting the decision-making process. In particular, self-monitoring (38/40, 95%), automated feedback (15/40, 38%), and patient education (13/40, 38%) were commonly used as self-management support strategies. Of the 23 studies that implemented decision support strategies, clinical decision making was delegated to patients in 10 studies (43%). The impact on patient outcomes was consistent with studies that used cellular phones. Patients with heart failure and asthma reported improved quality of life. Qualitative analysis yielded 2 themes of facilitating technology adoption for older adults and 3 themes of barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Limitations of current research included a lack of gerontological focus, dominance of preexperimental design, narrow research scope, inadequate support for participants, and insufficient evidence for clinical outcome. Recommendations for future research include generating evidence for smart device-based programs, using patient-generated data for advanced data mining techniques, validating patient decision support systems, and expanding mHealth practice through innovative technologies."

The purpose of this study is to describe the development, content, and protocol of our (cost-)effectiveness study that assesses a perioperative integrated care program, including a personalized eHealth app, for knee arthroplasty patients aimed to enhance societal participation post-surgery compared to care as usual. METHODS: The intervention will be tested in a multicentre randomized controlled trial with eleven participating Dutch medical centers (i.e., hospitals and clinics). Working patients on the waiting-list for a total- or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty with the intention to return to work after surgery will be included. After pre-stratification on medical centre with or without eHealth as usual care, operation procedure (total- or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty) and recovery expectations regarding return to work, randomization will take place at the patient-level. A minimum of 138 patients will be included in both the intervention and control group, 276 in total. The control group will receive usual care. On top of care as usual, patients in the intervention group will receive an intervention consisting of three components: 1) a personalized eHealth intervention called ikHerstel ('I Recover') including an activity tracker, 2) goal setting using goal attainment scaling to improve rehabilitation and 3) a referral to a case-manager. Our main outcome is quality of life, based on patient-reported physical functioning (using PROMIS-PF). (Cost-)effectiveness will be assessed from a healthcare and societal perspective. Data collection has been started in 2020 and is expected to finish in 2024. DISCUSSION: Improving societal participation for knee arthroplasty is relevant for patients, health care providers, employers and society. This multicentre randomized controlled trial will evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of a personalized integrated care program for knee arthroplasty patients, consisting of effective intervention components based on previous studies, compared to care as usual.

Development of a Framework for the Implementation of Synchronous Digital Mental Health: Realist Synthesis of Systematic Reviews,"Villarreal-Zegarra D, Alarcon-Ruiz CA, Melendez-Torres GJ, Torres-Puente R, Navarro-Flores A, Cavero V, Ambrosio-Melgarejo J, Rojas-Vargas J, Almeida G, Albitres-Flores L, Romero-Cabrera AB, Huarcaya-Victoria J.",JMIR Ment Health. 2022 Mar 29;9(3):e34760. doi: 10.2196/34760.,Villarreal-Zegarra D,JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022/03/29,PMC9006141,,10.2196/34760,"BACKGROUND: The use of technologies has served to reduce gaps in access to treatment, and digital health interventions show promise in the care of mental health problems. However, to understand what and how these interventions work, it is imperative to document the aspects related to their challenging implementation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine what evidence is available for synchronous digital mental health implementation and to develop a framework, informed by a realist review, to explain what makes digital mental health interventions work for people with mental health problems. METHODS: The SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, and Research type) framework was used to develop the following review question: What makes digital mental health interventions with a synchronous component work on people with mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, or stress, based on implementation, economic, quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies? The MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases were searched from January 1, 2015, to September 2020 with no language restriction. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) was used to assess the risk of bias and Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (CERQual) was used to assess the confidence in cumulative evidence. Realist synthesis analysis allowed for developing a framework on the implementation of synchronous digital mental health using a grounded-theory approach with an emergent approach. RESULTS: A total of 21 systematic reviews were included in the study. Among these, 90% (n=19) presented a critically low confidence level as assessed with AMSTAR-2. The realist synthesis allowed for the development of three hypotheses to identify the context and mechanisms in which these interventions achieve these outcomes: (1) these interventions reach populations otherwise unable to have access because they do not require the physical presence of the therapist nor the patient, thereby tackling geographic barriers posed by in-person therapy; (2) these interventions reach populations otherwise unable to have access because they can be successfully delivered by nonspecialists, which makes them more cost-effective to implement in health services; and (3) these interventions are acceptable and show good results in satisfaction because they require less need of disclosure and provide more privacy, comfortability, and participation, enabling the establishment of rapport with the therapist. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a framework with three hypotheses that explain what makes digital mental health interventions with a synchronous component work on people with mental health problems. Each hypothesis represents essential outcomes in the implementation process.

A Systematic Review of Personalized Health Applications through Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) on Cardiovascular Health Optimization,"Quazi S, Malik JA.",J Cardiovasc Dev Dis. 2022 Aug 16;9(8):273. doi: 10.3390/jcdd9080273.,Quazi S,J Cardiovasc Dev Dis,2022,2022/08/25,PMC9410340,,10.3390/jcdd9080273,"Introduction: Currently, the deployment of human-computer interactive technologies to provide personalized care has grown and immensely taken shape in most healthcare settings. With the increasing growth of the internet and technology, personalized health interventions including smartphones, associated apps, and other interventions demonstrate prowess in various health fields, including cardiovascular management. This systematic review thus examines the effectiveness of various human-computer interactions technologies through telehealth (mainly eHealth) towards optimizing the outcomes in cardiovascular treatment. Methods: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases using key terms was conducted from 2000 to November 2021 to identify suitable studies that explored the use of human-computer interaction technologies to provide a personalized care approach to facilitate bolstered outcomes for cardiovascular patients, including the elderly. The included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias, and the authors undertook a data extraction task. Results: Ten studies describing the use of a mix of personalized health app (mHealth) interventions were identified and included in the study. Among the included studies, nine of them were randomized trials. All of the studies demonstrated the effectiveness of various personalized health interventions in maximizing the benefits of cardiovascular disease treatment. Conclusions: Personalized health application interventions through precision medicine has great potential to boost cardiovascular disease management outcomes, including rehabilitation. Fundamentally, since each intervention's focus might differ based on the disease and outcome preference, it is recommended that more research be done to tailor the interventions to specific disease and patient outcome expectations."
Personalised eHealth intervention to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in rehabilitation after cardiac operations: study protocol for the PACO randomised controlled trial (NCT03470246),"Vasankari V, Halonen J, Husu P, Vähä-Ypyä H, Tokola K, Suni J, Sievänen H, Anttila V, Airaksinen J, Vasankari T, Hartikainen J.",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med. 2019 Jul 5;5(1):e000539. doi: 10.1136/bmjsem-2019-000539. eCollection 2019.,Vasankari V,BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,2019,2019/07/30,PMC6615853,,10.1136/bmjsem-2019-000539,"INTRODUCTION: Personalized intervention to increase physical Activity and reduce sedentary behaviour in rehabilitation after Cardiac Operations (PACO) is a smartphone-based and accelerometer-based eHealth intervention to increase physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary behaviour (SB) among patients recovering from cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present protocol describes a randomised controlled clinical trial to be conducted in the Heart Centres of Kuopio and Turku university hospitals. The trial comprises 540 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement or mitral valve repair. The patients will be randomised into two groups. The control group will receive standard postsurgical rehabilitation guidance. The eHealth intervention group will be given the same guidance together with personalised PA guidance during 90 days after discharge. These patients will receive personalised daily goals to increase PA and reduce SB via the ExSedapplication. Triaxial accelerometers will be exploited to record patients' daily accumulated PA and SB, and transmit them to the application. Using the accelerometer data, the application will provide online guidance to the patients and feedback of accomplishing their activity goals. The data will also be transmitted to the cloud, where a physiotherapist can monitor individual activity profiles and customise the subsequent PA and SB goals online. The postoperative improvement in patients' step count, PA, exercise capacity, quality of sleep, laboratory markers, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) parameters and quality of life, and reduction in SB and incidence of major cardiac events are investigated as outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The PACO intervention aims to build a personalised eHealth tool for the online tutoring of cardiac surgery patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03470246."
Internet-based cognitive therapy for women with antenatal depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: protocol for a multi-center randomized controlled trial across China,"Duan CC, Yu JL, Tao J, Zhang C, Zhang D, Zeng X, Zeng WT, Xu HL, Qiu JY, Dennis CL, Jin L, Huang HF, Wu YT.",Trials. 2022 Sep 21;23(1):797. doi: 10.1186/s13063-022-06728-5.,Duan CC,Trials,2022,2022/09/21,PMC9490680,,10.1186/s13063-022-06728-5,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common among pregnant women. Internet-delivered psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) have been developed to increase accessibility and address common help-seeking barriers, especially during pandemic period. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of iCBT on reducing depressive symptoms among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic with the overall goal of preventing depression recurrence in the first 12 months postpartum. METHODS: A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted where 300 pregnant women early in their third trimester will be screened for depression symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during a routine obstetrical visit. Eligible and consenting women with a score greater than 9 will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either intervention group or control group. ICBT involving the completion of 7 weekly online modules will be delivered via a well-designed perinatal mental healthcare app. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of iCBT on reducing depression symptoms among pregnant Chinese women starting from their third trimester. The secondary objectives are to examine the effect of iCBT on anxiety, sleep quality, social support, parenting stress, co-parenting relationship, and infant development. DISCUSSION: This multi-center randomized controlled trial has been planned in accordance with best practices in behavioral trial design. The internet-based intervention addressed the needs of pregnant women during a major pandemic where face-to-face therapy is not preferable. The trial has a relatively large sample size with sufficient power to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT intervention for the primary and secondary outcomes. One year follow-up evaluation in the study is designed to determine the longer-term effect of the intervention on both maternal and infant outcomes. Although a limitation is the assessment of depression and anxiety using self-report measures, these easily incorporated and maternal-preferred assessments allow for real-life scalability if the intervention is proven to be effective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics was approved by the institutional review board of International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital (GKLW2020-25). Dissemination of results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and presented at scientific conferences. TRIAL STATUS: The first patient was enrolled on 19 August 2020.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to August 2021 that tested mobile health (mHealth) PA and/or dietary interventions among cancer survivors and reported on the feasibility, satisfaction, behavioral change, and/or quality of life (QOL) outcomes. Results: In total, 61 articles were identified on PubMed, and 23 of those met the inclusion criteria. The most common cancers were breast (n = 1000), prostate (n = 713), and colorectal (n = 650). Participants were predominantly White (median: 84%, interquartile range (IQR): 20%) and college-educated (58%). The interventions varied, but the most common combination of components (six studies) was a website/mobile app with an activity tracker and coaching. In terms of duration, 70% (n = 16) of the interventions lasted 12 weeks. The median total tracker wear was 87% of the study days (IQR: 6%) and the median text-message reply rate was 73% (IQR 4%). Most participants (median: 87%; IQR: 16%) were satisfied with at least one intervention component. Eleven out of 18 studies examining behavioral change reported significant between-group differences and six out of 11 studies examining QoL reported significant improvements. Conclusions: mHealth interventions are a promising approach to improving the PA and diets of cancer survivors. Research in racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations is needed."

Furthermore, electronic tools offer a medium by which consumers can more actively navigate personal healthcare information. Understanding how, why and among whom such strategies have an effect can help determine the requirements for implementing them at a scale. This paper aims to detail a process evaluation that will (1) assess implementation fidelity of a multicomponent eHealth intervention; (2) determine its effective features; (3) explore contextual factors influencing and maintaining user engagement; and (4) describe barriers, facilitators, preferences and acceptability of such interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Mixed-methods sequential design to derive, examine, triangulate and report data from multiple sources.

Evidence Synthesis of Digital Interventions to Mitigate the Negative Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Public Mental Health: Rapid Meta-review,"Rauschenberg C, Schick A, Hirjak D, Seidler A, Paetzold I, Apfelbacher C, Riedel-Heller SG, Reininghaus U.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Mar 10;23(3):e23365. doi: 10.2196/23365.,Rauschenberg C,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/02/19,PMC7951054,,10.2196/23365,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has negative effects on public mental health. Digital interventions that have been developed and evaluated in recent years may be used to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic. However, evidence-based recommendations on the use of existing telemedicine and internet-based (eHealth) and app-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the theoretical and empirical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions related to public mental health provision (ie, mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders) that may help to reduce the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A rapid meta-review was conducted. The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions and determinants likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 815 peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified, of which 83 met the inclusion criteria. Our findings suggest that there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions. Evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (eg, blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on process quality, cost-effectiveness, and long-term effects is very limited. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. In times of physical distancing, quarantine, and restrictions on social contacts, decision makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and invest time and efforts in the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs."

Many adolescents and young adults struggle with long-term complications in the physical, psychosocial, economic, and academic domains. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an innovative platform for delivering supportive care, particularly through the utilization of apps on smartphones and tablets. To create a successful mHealth intervention for adolescents and young adults, youth input and feedback is essential. The process of cocreation, in which the target app user has a direct role in dictating design and function, was utilized to create the prototype smartphone app for adolescents and young adults with cancer, ""Kraeftvaerket."" OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to describe the protocol for the evaluation of the Kraeftvaerket app, a prototype app designed via cocreation, to support and improve health-related quality of life for adolescents and young adults with cancer. METHODS: The Kraeftvaerket app has three primary features, (1) a symptom and activity diary, (2) a supportive communication network between app users, and (3) a ""one-stop shop"" information bank with practical information as well as links to patient organizations and other resources. The app will be evaluated in two phases, a pilot test and an implementation test. In the pilot test, the app will be launched to a test group of 20 adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 29 years, selected for equal representation amongst age group and treatment status. Patients will be allowed to utilize the app over the course of six weeks and will complete a baseline and follow-up European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) health-related quality of life inventory. In addition, participant focus group interviews will be conducted according to a semistructured interview guide. Resulting data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. Results and appropriate analysis from both the qualitative and quantitative branches of the pilot test will be discussed amongst the research group, and appropriate changes based on user feedback will be made to the app before the final project phase. In the implementation test, the app will be provided and utilized by a sample of 50 adolescents and young adults aged 15-29 years selected for equal representation amongst gender, age group, diagnosis, and treatment status over the course of 3 months. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline and follow-up EORTC QLQ-C30 HRQoL inventory. RESULTS: Pilot testing is expected to take place in February 2018, and implementation testing is expected to begin May 2018. CONCLUSIONS: It is the hope that Kraeftvaerket app will serve as a beneficial and easily utilized product.

Feasibility of a Web-Based Platform (Trial My App) to Efficiently Conduct Randomized Controlled Trials of mHealth Apps For Patients With Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Protocol For Evaluating an mHealth App for Hypertension,"Lokker C, Jezrawi R, Gabizon I, Varughese J, Brown M, Trottier D, Alvarez E, Schwalm JD, McGillion M, Ma J, Bhagirath V.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Feb 1;10(2):e26155. doi: 10.2196/26155.,Lokker C,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/02/01,PMC7884212,,10.2196/26155,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can improve health by improving cardiovascular risk factors, but their adoption in care by physicians and patients is untapped. Few mHealth apps have been evaluated in clinical trials, and due to the fast pace of technological development, those previously evaluated are often outdated by the time trial results are available. Given the rapid pace of change in this field, it is not feasible to rigorously evaluate mHealth apps with current methodologies. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of using a web research platform called Trial My App to conduct efficient and rigorous web-based randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth apps relevant to patients with cardiovascular risk factors by evaluating an app that targets hypertension. METHODS: For this study, 200 participants with suboptimally controlled hypertension will be recruited through advertisements in newsletters, media, and the internet, as well as through referrals from their health care providers. Screening, consent, randomization, and collection of patient-important health confidence and self-management ability outcomes will be conducted online through the Trial My App research platform. Participants will be randomized into 2 groups: 100 that will use an mHealth app for tracking hypertension and 100 that will be considered as an educational control. All participants will complete questionnaires at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months after enrolment. A substudy to validate the method of blood pressure readings and the consistency of data entered through Trial My App will be conducted with 40 participants. RESULTS: The development of the Trial My App web platform has been completed. The creation of survey instruments has been completed in collaboration with our patient partners and advisory board. Recruitment is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021; data collection and analysis are expected to be completed approximately 1 year after study commencement. Results will be disseminated through conferences and publications. The primary outcomes of this study include the feasibility of conducting an RCT using the Trial My App platform by reporting recruitment, retention, and completion statistics. We will validate app-entered data with a standard 7-day home blood pressure measurement method. Lastly, the pilot, nonblinded RCT will assess the effectiveness of the mHealth app in improving the control of hypertension compared with the control of hypertension in the educational control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study will determine if it is feasible to use the Trial My App web-based platform to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth apps for patients with cardiovascular risk factors. As more mHealth apps are evaluated in RCTs, patients will be able to select apps that meet their needs and physicians will be able to make evidence-based recommendations to their patients for apps aimed at improving cardiovascular health.

Digital Support for Healthier Eating Habits Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Protocol for a Randomized Clinical Trial Within Primary Care (HAPPY Trial),"Trolle Lagerros Y, Dahlgren A, Sjöblom L, Bonn SE.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Nov 16;9(11):e24422. doi: 10.2196/24422.,Trolle Lagerros Y,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/11/16,PMC7704281,,10.2196/24422,"BACKGROUND: Despite the large impact that dietary habits have in the management of diabetes, few tools for supporting healthy eating habits are available for persons with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of a 12-week, mobile health (mHealth), app-based intervention promoting healthy eating habits among patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The HAPPY (Healthy eating using APP technologY) trial is a randomized clinical trial with two arms aiming to include 200 patients, 18 years of age or older, with type 2 diabetes. Both women and men are eligible for inclusion. Study participants are randomized 1:1 to an intervention group, where they are instructed to use a smartphone app promoting healthy eating, or to a control group, where they receive standard primary care only, for a period of 12 weeks. Each week a new topic (eg, vegetable intake) is introduced via the app. After an introduction text, the user is given a topic-related activity to perform (eg, eat one additional serving of vegetables per day during that week). The app records daily progress and sends automatic reminders or feedback to the user. Dietary intake, body composition, clinical variables, and biomarkers are measured at baseline and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. An extensive web-based questionnaire comprising several validated questionnaires assessing a number of lifestyle factors is distributed via email at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups; lifestyle factors include, for example, sleep, physical activity, eating behavior, and health-related quality of life. The effect of the intervention on dietary intake (primary outcome) and on glycated hemoglobin and blood lipid levels, body composition, blood pressure, other lifestyle factors, and overall health (secondary outcomes) will be assessed. RESULTS: Data collection is ongoing. Recruitment of participants started in January 2019. Findings from the study are expected to be published by the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Technology development provides new ways to promote and support long-term adherence to healthier eating habits. mHealth-based approaches allow for real-time interaction and the delivery of an intervention at any time. Further, focusing on overall diet allows the user to apply new knowledge to current eating patterns, creating an individualized approach. In this study, we evaluate the effect of using a new smartphone app promoting healthy eating habits on dietary intake, clinical markers, and lifestyle factors among patients with type 2 diabetes.

A Self-Directed Mobile Intervention (WaznApp) to Promote Weight Control Among Employees at a Lebanese University: Protocol for a Feasibility Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Bardus M, Hamadeh G, Hayek B, Al Kherfan R.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2018 May 16;7(5):e133. doi: 10.2196/resprot.9793.,Bardus M,JMIR Res Protoc,2018,2018/05/18,PMC5981057,,10.2196/resprot.9793,"BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity have become major health problems globally with more than 1.9 billion overweight adults. In Lebanon, the prevalence of obesity and overweight is 65.4% combined. Risk factors of obesity and overweight are preventable and can be addressed by modifications in the environment and in an individual's lifestyle. Mobile technologies are increasingly used in behavioral, self-directed weight management interventions, providing users with additional opportunities to attain weight control (weight loss, weight gain prevention, etc). Mobile apps may allow for the delivery of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), which provide support through skill building, emotional support, and instrumental support, following the participants' progress. A few commercially available apps offer JITAI features, but no studies have tested their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of a self-directed weight loss intervention, targeting employees of an academic institution, using a virtual coaching app with JITAI features (Lark) and a self-help calorie-counting app (MyFitnessPal). The secondary objective is to estimate the effects of the intervention on main study outcomes. METHODS: This study is a single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial with 2 study arms (intervention and control). Participants will be randomly allocated in equal proportions to the intervention (Lark) and control groups (MyFitnessPal). To be eligible for this study, participants must be employed full- or part-time at the university or its medical center, able to read English, have a smartphone, and be interested in controlling their weight. Recruitment strategies entail email invitations, printed posters, and social media postings. We will assess quantitative rates of recruitment, adherence, and retention, self-reported app quality using the user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale. We will also assess changes in weight-related outcomes (absolute weight and waist circumference), behavioral outcomes (physical activity and diet), and cognitive factors (motivation to participate in the trial and to manage weight). RESULTS: WaznApp was funded in June 2017, and recruitment started in March 2018. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide information as to whether the selected mobile apps offer a feasible solution for promoting weight management in an academic workplace. The results will inform a larger trial whose results might be replicated in similar workplaces in Lebanon and the Middle East and North Africa region, and will be used as a benchmark for further investigations in other settings and similar target groups.

Testing an mHealth System for Individuals With Mild to Moderate Alcohol Use Disorders: Protocol for a Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial,"Park LS, Chih MY, Stephenson C, Schumacher N, Brown R, Gustafson D, Barrett B, Quanbeck A.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Feb 18;11(2):e31109. doi: 10.2196/31109.,Park LS,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/02/18,PMC8900897,,10.2196/31109,"BACKGROUND: The extent of human interaction needed to achieve effective and cost-effective use of mobile health (mHealth) apps for individuals with mild to moderate alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains largely unexamined. This study seeks to understand how varying levels of human interaction affect the ways in which an mHealth intervention for the prevention and treatment of AUDs works or does not work, for whom, and under what circumstances. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to detect the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention by assessing differences in self-reported risky drinking patterns and quality of life between participants in three study groups (self-monitored, peer-supported, and clinically integrated). The cost-effectiveness of each approach will also be assessed. METHODS: This hybrid type 1 study is an unblinded patient-level randomized clinical trial testing the effects of using an evidence-based mHealth system on participants' drinking patterns and quality of life. There are two groups of participants for this study: individuals receiving the intervention and health care professionals practicing in the broader health care environment. The intervention is a smartphone app that encourages users to reduce their alcohol consumption within the context of integrative medicine using techniques to build healthy habits. The primary outcomes for quantitative analysis will be participant data on their risky drinking days and quality of life as well as app use from weekly and quarterly surveys. Cost measures include intervention and implementation costs. The cost per participant will be determined for each study arm, with intervention and implementation costs separated within each group. There will also be a qualitative assessment of health care professionals' engagement with the app as well as their thoughts on participant experience with the app. RESULTS: This protocol was approved by the Health Sciences Minimal Risk Institutional Review Board on November 18, 2019, with subsequent annual reviews. Recruitment began on March 6, 2020, but was suspended on March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Limited recruitment resumed on July 6, 2020. Trial status as of November 17, 2021, is as follows: 357 participants were enrolled in the study for a planned enrollment of 546 participants. CONCLUSIONS: The new knowledge gained from this study could have wide and lasting benefits related to the integration of mHealth systems for individuals with mild to moderate AUDs. The results of this study will guide policy makers and providers toward cost-effective ways to incorporate technology in health care and community settings.

Optimizing an mHealth Intervention to Improve Uptake and Adherence to HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis in Young Transgender Women: Protocol for a Multi-Phase Trial,"MacDonell KK, Wang B, Phanuphak N, Janamnuaysook R, Srimanus P, Rongkavilit C, Naar S.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 May 19;11(5):e37659. doi: 10.2196/37659.,MacDonell KK,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/05/19,PMC9164094,,10.2196/37659,"BACKGROUND: Vulnerable adolescents and emerging adults (aged 18-29 years), particularly young transgender women, are among the fastest-growing HIV positive populations worldwide. Thailand has the highest adult HIV seroprevalence in Asia, with a rate of infection among this population of 18%. Widespread technology offers opportunities for innovative mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious HIV prevention strategy recommended for at-risk individuals. PrEP is highly effective when taken as prescribed, but uptake and adherence have been low, with high discontinuation rates among youth. OBJECTIVE: We propose to develop and pilot a multi-component, technology-based intervention to promote PrEP usage. We will adapt an existing 2-session, technology-delivered, motivational interviewing-based intervention to focus on PrEP use in transgender women in Thailand. We call this the Motivational Enhancement System for PrEP Uptake and Adherence (MES-PrEP). We will also refine and enhance YaCool, a mobile app with integrated text messaging developed and used clinically by our Thai team. The new version of the app is called Enhanced YaCool, and it enables self-management of gender and sexual health (including PrEP). Our primary aim is to develop and assess the preliminary efficacy of this mHealth intervention. METHODS: We will utilize a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to identify the most effective intervention component or combination of components to improve PrEP usage in Thai transgender women. The study includes two phases: phase I (R21) includes qualitative interviews with key stakeholders to explore barriers and facilitators of PrEP usage through thematic analysis to inform intervention adaptation. Following this, we will adapt and beta-test MES-PrEP and Enhanced YaCool for functionality and feasibility using a community advisory board of HIV-negative Thai transgender women. In phase II (R33), we will conduct a MOST design-based trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of MES-PrEP and Enhanced YaCool. Eighty HIV-negative participants who are currently taking PrEP and 80 participants who are not will be randomized to four conditions: (1) standard PrEP counseling (the control condition); (2) MES-PrEP and standard PrEP counseling; (3) Enhanced YaCool and standard PrEP counseling; and (4) MES-PrEP, Enhanced YaCool, and standard PrEP counseling. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be assessed through usage patterns and the System Usability Scale. Preliminary impact will be assessed by evaluating the proportion of participants who initiate PrEP and their level of adherence to PrEP. Assessments will be at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postintervention. Biomarkers of adherence to PrEP, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections will be collected. RESULTS: Upon project completion, we will have an optimized mHealth intervention to support the use of PrEP by transgender women that will be ready for testing in a larger efficacy trial. CONCLUSIONS: Even though transgender women in Thailand face increasing risks of HIV, few interventions have targeted them. Effective developmentally and culturally tailored interventions are needed to prevent HIV transmission in this high-risk population.

Digital Interventions Supporting Self-care in People With Type 2 Diabetes Across Greater Manchester (Greater Manchester Diabetes My Way): Protocol for a Mixed Methods Evaluation,"Goldthorpe J, Allen T, Brooks J, Kontopantelis E, Holland F, Moss C, Wake DJ, Brodie D, Cunningham SG, Kanumilli N, Bishop H, Jones E, Milne N, Ball S, Jenkins M, Nicinska B, Ratto M, Morgan-Curran M, Johnson G, Rutter MK.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Aug 17;11(8):e26237. doi: 10.2196/26237.,Goldthorpe J,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/08/17,PMC9434385,,10.2196/26237,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is common, with a prevalence of approximately 7% of the population in the United Kingdom. The quality of T2D care is inconsistent across the United Kingdom, and Greater Manchester (GM) does not currently achieve the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence treatment targets. Barriers to delivery of care include low attendance and poor engagement with local T2D interventions, which tend to consist of programs of education delivered in traditional, face-to-face clinical settings. Thus, a flexible approach to T2D management that is accessible to people from different backgrounds and communities is needed. Diabetes My Way (DMW) is a digital platform that offers a comprehensive self-management and educational program that should be accessible to a wide range of people through mobile apps and websites. Building on evidence generated by a Scotland-wide pilot study, DMW is being rolled out and tested across GM. OBJECTIVE: The overarching objectives are to assess whether DMW improves outcomes for patients with T2D in the GM area, to explore the acceptability of the DMW intervention to stakeholders, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS: A mixed methods approach will be used. We will take a census approach to recruitment in that all eligible participants in GM will be invited to participate. The primary outcomes will be intervention-related changes compared with changes observed in a matched group of controls, and the secondary outcomes will be within-person intervention-related changes. The cost-effectiveness analysis will focus on obtaining reliable estimates of how each intervention affects risk factors such as HbA1c and costs across population groups. Qualitative data will be collected via semistructured interviews and focus groups and organized using template analysis. RESULTS: As of May 10, 2021, a total of 316 participants have been recruited for the quantitative study and have successfully enrolled. A total of 278 participants attempted to register but did not have appropriate permissions set by the general practitioners to gain access to their data. In total, 10 participants have been recruited for the qualitative study (7 practitioners and 3 patients). An extension to recruitment has been granted for the quantitative element of the research, and analysis should be complete by December 2022. Recruitment and analysis for the qualitative study should be complete by December 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study can be used both to develop the DMW system and improve accessibility and usability in more deprived populations generally, thus improving equity in access to support for T2D self-management.

Patient-clinician digital health interventions for the hip fracture population: a scoping review,"Backman C, Papp S, Harley A, Skidmore B, Green M, Shah S, Berdusco R, Poitras S, Beaulé PE, French-Merkley V.",BMC Health Serv Res. 2023 Oct 2;23(1):1052. doi: 10.1186/s12913-023-09784-y.,Backman C,BMC Health Serv Res,2023,2023/10/02,PMC10546736,,10.1186/s12913-023-09784-y,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults with hip fracture often require extensive post-surgery care across multiple sectors, making follow-up care even more important to ensure an ideal recovery. With the increased adoption of technology, patient-clinician digital health interventions can potentially improve post-surgery outcomes of hip fracture patients by helping them and their caregivers better understand the various aspects of their care, post-hip fracture surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine the available literature on the impact of hip fracture-specific, patient-clinician digital health interventions on patient outcomes and health care delivery processes. We also aimed to identify the barriers and enablers to the uptake and implementation of these technologies and to provide strategies for improved use of these digital health interventions. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review following the six stages of Arksey and O'Malley's framework and following the PRISMA-ScR reporting format. Searches were conducted in five databases. In addition to hand searching for relevant studies from the references of all included studies, we also conducted a grey literature search to identify relevant primary studies. Screening of titles and abstracts as well as full texts were performed independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers also performed the data extraction of the included studies. RESULTS: After screening 3,638 records, 20 articles met the criteria and 1 article was identified through hand searching. Various patient-clinician digital health interventions were described including telehealth /telerehabilitation programs (n = 6), care transition /follow-up interventions (n = 5), online resources (n = 2), and wearable devices /sensor monitoring (n = 1). Outcomes were varied and included functional status, gait/mobility, quality of life, psychological factors, satisfaction, survival/complications, caregiver outcomes, compliance, technology-user interactions, and feedback on the use of the digital health interventions. For clinicians, a key barrier to the use of the digital health interventions was the acceptability of the technology. However, the usefulness of the digital health intervention by clinicians was seen as both a barrier and an enabler. For patients and caregivers, all the themes were seen as both a barrier and an enabler depending on the study. These themes included: 1) availability and access, 2) usability, 3) knowledge and skills, 4) acceptability, and 5) usefulness of the digital health intervention. CONCLUSION: Many behavioural factors affect the use of patient-clinician digital health interventions. However, a specific attention should be focused on the acceptability of the technology by the clinicians to encourage uptake of the digital health interventions. The results of this scoping review can help to better understand the factors that may be targeted to increase the use of these technologies by clinicians, patients, and caregivers."
Pilot Testing of an mHealth App for Tobacco Cessation in People Living With HIV: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Brin M, Trujillo P, Jia H, Cioe P, Huang MC, Chen H, Qian X, Xu W, Schnall R.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Oct 19;12:e49558. doi: 10.2196/49558.,Brin M,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/10/19,PMC10623232,,10.2196/49558,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 40% of people living with HIV smoke cigarettes. Although smoking rates in the United States have been declining in recent years, people living with HIV continue to smoke cigarettes at twice the rate of the general population. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is an effective tool for people living with a chronic illness, such as HIV, as currently 84% of households in the United States report that they have a smartphone. Although many studies have used mHealth interventions for smoking cessation, few studies have recruited people living with HIV who smoke. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Sense2Quit App as a tool for people living with HIV who are motivated to quit smoking. METHODS: The Sense2Quit study is a 2-arm RCT for people living with HIV who smoke cigarettes (n=60). Participants are randomized to either the active intervention condition, which consists of an 8-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy, standard smoking cessation counseling, and access to the Sense2Quit mobile app and smartwatch, or the control condition, which consists of standard smoking cessation counseling and a referral to the New York State Smokers' Quitline. The Sense2Quit app is a mobile app connected through Bluetooth to a smartwatch that tracks smoking gestures and distinguishes them from other everyday hand movements. In the Sense2Quit app, participants can view their smoking trends, which are recorded through their use of the smartwatch, including how often or how much they smoke and the amount of money that they are spending on cigarettes, watch videos with quitting tips, information, and distractions, play games, set reminders, and communicate with a study team member. RESULTS: Enrollment of study participants began in March 2023 and is expected to end in October 2023. All data collection is expected to be completed by the end of January 2024. This RCT will test the difference in outcomes between the control and intervention arms. The primary outcome will be the percentage of participants with biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence smoking or tobacco abstinence at their 12-week follow-up. Results from this pilot study will be disseminated to the research community following the completion of all data collection. CONCLUSIONS: The Sense2Quit study leverages mHealth so that it can help smokers improve their efforts at smoking cessation. Our research has the potential to not only increase quitting rates among people living with HIV who may need a prolonged, tailored intervention but also inform further development of mHealth for people living with HIV. This mHealth study will contribute significant findings to the greater mHealth research community, providing evidence as to how mHealth should be developed and tested among the target population.

Over the recent years, advanced computing, genomics, and artificial intelligence are considered part of digital health. In the context of the World Health Organization (WHO) global strategy 2020-2025, digital health is defined as ""the field of knowledge and practice associated with the development and use of digital technologies to improve health."" The scoping review protocol details the procedure for developing a comprehensive list of DHIs in Sub-Saharan Africa and documenting their roles in strengthening health systems. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review will be done according to the Joanne Briggs institute reviewers manual and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and explanation. The protocol has been registered at the Open Science Framework (OSF) database at https://osf.io/5kzq7. The review will include DHIs conceptualized/developed/designed, adapted, piloted, deployed, scaled up, and addressing health challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa. We will retrieve data from the global DHI repository-the WHO Digital Health Atlas (DHA)- and supplement it with information from the WHO eHealth Observatory, eHealth Survey (2015), and eHealth country profiles report. Additional searches will be conducted in four (4) electronic databases: PubMed, HINARI-Reasearch4Life, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. The review will also include gray literature and reference lists of selected studies. Data will be organized in conceptual categories looking at digital health interventions' distinct function toward achieving health sector objectives. DISCUSSION: Sub-Saharan Africa is an emerging powerhouse in DHI innovations with rapid expansion and evolvement. The enthusiasm for digital health has experienced challenges including an escalation of short-lived digital health interventions, duplication, and minimal documentation of evidence on their impact on the health system. Efficient use of resources is important when striving toward the use digital health interventions in health systems strengthening. This can be achieved through documenting successes and lessons learnt over time. CONCLUSION: The review will provide the evidence to guide further investments in DHIs, avoid duplication, circumvent barriers, focus on gaps, and scale-up successful interventions."
A Theory-Based mHealth Intervention (Getting Off) for Methamphetamine-Using Men Who Have Sex With Men: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Reback CJ, Fletcher JB, Mata RP.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Feb 22;10(2):e22572. doi: 10.2196/22572.,Reback CJ,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/02/22,PMC7939940,,10.2196/22572,"BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (meth) use among men who have sex with men (MSM) is associated with increased HIV prevalence and transmission and substandard advancement along the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given the growth of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, it is no longer necessary to limit meth treatment options to physical, brick-and-mortar sites, and administration using generic, nontailored content. OBJECTIVE: In a 2-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=300), we aim to evaluate the use of an mHealth intervention (Getting Off) to assess the impact and noninferiority of a cross-platform app (developed from a manualized meth treatment intervention) to help MSM reduce meth use and HIV sexual risk behaviors and improve their advancement along the HIV prevention and care continuum (HIV testing, pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and persistence, and antiretroviral therapy uptake and adherence). METHODS: Participants will be randomized into 2 arms: arm A, with immediate access to the app (immediate delivery: n=150), or arm B, with delayed access to the app after a 30-day period (delayed delivery: n=150). Participants in both arms will use the same Getting Off app and will have 30 days to complete the 24 sessions. Participants will be assessed at the 1-, 2- (delayed delivery arm only), 3-, 6-, and 9-month timepoints to determine observed treatment effects and will be compared with a historical matched sample of participants (n=~600) who received the brick-and-mortar group-based Getting Off intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment began in January 2019 for phase 1, the formative phase. In January and February 2019, 4 focus groups (N=36) were formed to provide input on the adaptation of the group-based manual intervention to a mobile app. Data collection for phase 2, the RCT, is expected to be completed in January 2023. The final results are anticipated in April 2023. CONCLUSIONS: By creating a culturally responsive mobile app, Getting Off aims to reduce meth use and improve sexual health outcomes among meth-using MSM. The Getting Off app could have significant public health impact by greatly expanding access to effective, affordable, private, culturally competent, and highly scalable meth treatment for MSM.

Using Wearable Passive Sensing to Predict Binge Eating in Response to Negative Affect Among Individuals With Transdiagnostic Binge Eating: Protocol for an Observational Study,"Presseller EK, Lampe EW, Zhang F, Gable PA, Guetterman TC, Forman EM, Juarascio AS.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Jul 6;12:e47098. doi: 10.2196/47098.,Presseller EK,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/07/06,PMC10360009,,10.2196/47098,"BACKGROUND: Binge eating (BE), characterized by eating a large amount of food accompanied by a sense of loss of control over eating, is a public health crisis. Negative affect is a well-established antecedent for BE. The affect regulation model of BE posits that elevated negative affect increases momentary risk for BE, as engaging in BE alleviates negative affect and reinforces the behavior. The eating disorder field's capacity to identify moments of elevated negative affect, and thus BE risk, has exclusively relied on ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA involves the completion of surveys in real time on one's smartphone to report behavioral, cognitive, and emotional symptoms throughout the day. Although EMA provides ecologically valid information, EMA surveys are often delivered only 5-6 times per day, involve self-report of affect intensity only, and are unable to assess affect-related physiological arousal. Wearable, psychophysiological sensors that measure markers of affect arousal including heart rate, heart rate variability, and electrodermal activity may augment EMA surveys to improve accurate real-time prediction of BE. These sensors can objectively and continuously measure biomarkers of nervous system arousal that coincide with affect, thus allowing them to measure affective trajectories on a continuous timescale, detect changes in negative affect before the individual is consciously aware of them, and reduce user burden to improve data completeness. However, it is unknown whether sensor features can distinguish between positive and negative affect states, given that physiological arousal may occur during both negative and positive affect states. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are (1) to test the hypothesis that sensor features will distinguish positive and negative affect states in individuals with BE with >60% accuracy and (2) test the hypothesis that a machine learning algorithm using sensor data and EMA-reported negative affect to predict the occurrence of BE will predict BE with greater accuracy than an algorithm using EMA-reported negative affect alone. METHODS: This study will recruit 30 individuals with BE who will wear Fitbit Sense 2 wristbands to passively measure heart rate and electrodermal activity and report affect and BE on EMA surveys for 4 weeks. Machine learning algorithms will be developed using sensor data to distinguish instances of high positive and high negative affect (aim 1) and to predict engagement in BE (aim 2). RESULTS: This project will be funded from November 2022 to October 2024. Recruitment efforts will be conducted from January 2023 through March 2024. Data collection is anticipated to be completed in May 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This study is anticipated to provide new insight into the relationship between negative affect and BE by integrating wearable sensor data to measure affective arousal. The findings from this study may set the stage for future development of more effective digital ecological momentary interventions for BE.

Delivery of a Mental Health Intervention for Chronic Pain Through an Artificial Intelligence-Enabled App (Wysa): Protocol for a Prospective Pilot Study,"Gupta M, Malik T, Sinha C.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Mar 31;11(3):e36910. doi: 10.2196/36910.,Gupta M,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/03/22,PMC9015778,,10.2196/36910,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain often experience coexisting, long-term and debilitating mental health comorbidities such as depression and anxiety. Artificial intelligence-supported cognitive behavioral therapy (AI-CBT) interventions could offer cost-effective, accessible, and potentially effective resources to address this problem. However, there is not enough research conducted about the efficacy of AI-CBT interventions for chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: This prospective cohort study aims to examine the efficacy and use of an AI-CBT intervention for chronic pain (Wysa for Chronic Pain app, Wysa Inc) using a conversational agent (with no human intervention). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study for chronic pain using a fully-automated, free-text-based conversational agent. METHODS: Participants with self-reported chronic pain (n=500) will be recruited online on a rolling basis from April 2022 through posts on US-based internet communities within this prospective cohort. Informed consent is received from participants within the app, and the Wysa for Chronic Pain intervention is delivered remotely for 8 weeks. Outcome measures including a numeric pain rating scale and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Pain Interference, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 questionnaires administered to test the effectiveness of the intervention on reducing levels of pain interference, depression, and anxiety. The therapeutic alliance created with the conversational agent will be assessed through the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised instrument. Retention and use statistics will be observed for adherence and engagement. RESULTS: The study will open for recruitment in April 2022, and data collection is expected to be completed by August 2022. The results for the primary outcomes are expected to be published by late 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health conversational agents driven by artificial intelligence could be effective in helping patients with chronic pain learn to self-manage their pain and common comorbidities like depression and anxiety. The Wysa for Chronic Pain app is one such digital intervention that can potentially serve as a solution to the problems of affordability and scalability associated with interventions that include a human therapist. This prospective study examines the efficacy of the app as a treatment solution for chronic pain. It aims to inform future practices and digital mental health interventions for individuals with chronic pain. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10.2196/36910."
Internet- and App-Based Stress Intervention for Distance-Learning Students With Depressive Symptoms: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Harrer M, Apolinário-Hagen J, Fritsche L, Drüge M, Krings L, Beck K, Salewski C, Zarski AC, Lehr D, Baumeister H, Ebert DD.",Front Psychiatry. 2019 May 21;10:361. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00361. eCollection 2019.,Harrer M,Front Psychiatry,2019,2019/06/11,PMC6537513,,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00361,"Background: Mental disorders are highly prevalent among university students. Distance-learning students are particularly burdened and have limited access to conventional university health services. Interventions for stress are sought after in distance learners and may help increase treatment coverage. Internet-based interventions have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating depression, but it remains unclear if interventions directed at academic stress also have this potential. Aim: The trial presented here investigates the effectiveness of an Internet- and App-based stress intervention in distance-learning students with elevated levels of depression. Methods: A sample of N = 200 students of a large German distance university with elevated levels of depression [Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale (CES-D) >/= 16] will be randomly assigned to either an Internet- and App-based stress management intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG) receiving an Internet-based psychoeducational program for academic stress. The IG consists of eight Internet-based sessions promoting stress management skills using cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving techniques. A mobile App will be employed to facilitate training transfer. Self-report data will be assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1; 7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up (T2). Potential moderators will be assessed at baseline. The primary outcome is depression (CES-D) post-treatment. Secondary outcomes include mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and academic outcomes. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat principle along with sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings. Additional health economic analyses will be conducted. Discussion: Results will provide the basis to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of Internet-delivered stress interventions in distance-learning students with symptoms of depression. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been reviewed and approved by the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg ethics committee (Erlangen, Germany; 33_17 Bc). Results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trial Registration (DRKS), identifier DRKS00011800."
Older Adults' Pain Outcomes After mHealth Interventions: Scoping Review,"Shade M, Kovaleva M, Harp K, Martin-Hammond A.",JMIR Aging. 2023 May 31;6:e46976. doi: 10.2196/46976.,Shade M,JMIR Aging,2023,2023/05/31,PMC10267779,,10.2196/46976,"BACKGROUND: Pain is prevalent and poorly managed in older adults. Although pain self-management strategies are helpful, adoption and access are limited; thus, technology provides an opportunity for intervention delivery. Mobile health (mHealth) is feasible to use in older adults; however, we have yet to understand the effect of mHealth pain self-management interventions on pain outcomes in older adults. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review is to examine the characteristics of mHealth interventions and their efficacy on pain outcomes in older adults with musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: With the assistance of a medical librarian, keywords and subject headings were generated, including but not limited to mobile health application, mHealth, digital, pain, pain management, and older. A search was conducted for papers in journal databases, including PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore, between 2000 and 2022. Papers were screened according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and reference lists were reviewed for additional paper inclusion. Three authors appraised the methodology of papers independently, then collaboratively to synthesize the evidence. RESULTS: Six publications were included in the scoping review. The design and methodology ranged widely from pilot studies to a comparative effectiveness trial. Older participants in the studies reported a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Delivery of the mHealth pain self-management interventions incorporated mobile devices, such as a smartphone or tablet. Most mHealth-delivered interventions were multicomponent and incorporated elements of in-person and telephone access to an interventionist. The findings suggested mHealth interventions may reduce pain intensity; however, pain interference and other pain-related conditions did not have a statistically significant reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Research that has explored mHealth for pain self-management is beginning to move beyond feasibility. The few experimental studies conducted in older adults are heterogeneous, and the interventions are mostly multicomponent. It is premature to conclude the interventions' significant effect on pain or pain-related symptoms. As technology continues to integrate into health care, more experimental research is warranted to examine the efficacy of mHealth interventions on a variety of pain outcomes in older adults."
Development and Exploration of the Effectiveness and Feasibility of a Digital Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DEsireD): Protocol for a Clinical Nonrandomized Pilot Trial in Brunei Darussalam,"Chan HN, Lim HS, Chong PL, Yung CK, Abd Mulok M, Wei Y, Yong AML.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Dec 7;11(12):e43208. doi: 10.2196/43208.,Chan HN,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/12/08,PMC9773025,,10.2196/43208,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. Digital interventions that incorporate the use of mobile phones and wearables have been getting popular. A combination of a digital intervention with support from professional management can enhance users' self-efficacy better than a digital intervention alone and provide better accessibility to a lifestyle intervention. However, there are limited studies exploring the feasibility and efficacy of applying a digital intervention in Muslim-majority countries, and none have been conducted in Brunei Darussalam. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a proposed 16-week digital intervention program for T2DM self-management and to guide the rollout of a mobile app as part of a population health solution for adults with T2DM in Brunei. The primary outcome of this study is to measure the proportion of participants with a hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) reduction of at least 0.6% from baseline, and the secondary outcomes include a change in HbA(1c), BMI, lipid profile, and EQ-5D-5L score. METHODS: This single-arm nonrandomized pilot study will recruit participants using web-based (with the national health care app [BruHealth] and official social media platforms being used for outreach) and offline (in-person recruitment at health centers) approaches. A target of 180 individuals with T2DM aged between 20 and 70 years that meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in a 16-week digital intervention program. Baseline and postintervention markers will be evaluated. RESULTS: The study received approval from the Medical and Health Research & Ethics Committee of the Brunei Darussalam Ministry of Health (MHREC/MOH/2022/4(1)). The recruitment process is ongoing, and we anticipate that the study will conclude by April 2023. This will be followed by data analysis and the reporting of outcomes with the intention to publish. The results of this study will be disseminated through scientific publications and conferences. This study will serve as a guide to launch T2DM digital therapeutic programs and extend to other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) if proven as an effective and feasible approach in Brunei. CONCLUSIONS: The Development and Exploration of the Effectiveness and Feasibility of a Digital Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DEsireD) study will be the first study to investigate the clinical effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed 16-week T2DM digital intervention program tailored for Brunei, a Muslim-majority country. The findings of this study can potentially scale up the proposed model of care to other NCDs as a national approach for health management solutions.

The Role of Digital Health Technology Interventions in the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review,"Nguyen V, Ara P, Simmons D, Osuagwu UL.",Clin Med Insights Endocrinol Diabetes. 2024 May 21;17:11795514241246419. doi: 10.1177/11795514241246419. eCollection 2024.,Nguyen V,Clin Med Insights Endocrinol Diabetes,2024,2024/05/23,PMC11110501,,10.1177/11795514241246419,"OBJECTIVES: Diabetes in the 21st century presents one of the greatest burdens of disease on the global population. Digitally mediated interventions have become imperative in alleviating this disease epidemic. We aimed to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on different health technologies for preventing Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and their efficacy in decreasing diabetes risk-related outcomes in at-risk patients in comparison to standard care. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched between October 2021 and December 2022. Studies including digital health technology interventions used for preventing diabetes development by reducing diabetes risk-related outcomes in at-risk adults (⩾18 years) were identified. Data on glycemic levels, incidence of T2DM, weight, and intervention descriptions were extracted, and the risk of bias (ROB) was assessed. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and 5 studies (56%) achieved clinically significant outcomes in at least one of the following: decreased weight (22%), glycemic levels (22%), or incidence of T2DM (11%). Two of the 3 (67%) computer-based interventions effectively reduced the HbA1c levels and mean weight of their study population, and 3 of 6 (50%) mobile based interventions (text messages, mobile app, and telehealth) decreased the incidence of T2DM and HbA1c levels. Four studies each had an overall low ROB and one had a high ROB due to attrition. CONCLUSION: Preliminary evidence identified in our review demonstrated that health technologies for diabetes prevention are effective for improving diabetes risk-related outcomes. Future research into digital technology protocol and studies of longer duration and more diverse populations are needed for clinical feasibility."

OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials is the first to evaluate the efficacy of eHealth interventions specifically for the treatment of binge eating disorder (characterized by compulsive overconsumption of food, in a relatively short period, and without compensatory behaviors such as purging or fasting). METHODS: A search on the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, and CINAHL was conducted for randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of eHealth treatment interventions with waitlist controls. RESULTS: From the databases searched, 3 studies (298 participants in total) met the inclusion criteria. All interventions were forms of internet-based guided cognitive behavioral therapy. The results of the analysis demonstrated that when compared with waitlist controls, individuals enrolled in eHealth interventions experienced a reduction in objective binge episodes (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.77, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.16) and eating disorder psychopathology (SMD -0.71, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.22), which included shape (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.22) and weight concerns (SMD -0.91, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.48). There was no significant difference in BMI between the eHealth interventions and controls (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide promising results for the use of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for binge eating disorder treatment and support the need for future research to explore the efficacy of these eHealth interventions."
Mobile App-Based Intervention for Pregnant Women With Stress Urinary Incontinence: Protocol for a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial,"Li T, Chen X, Wang J, Chen L, Cai W.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Mar 10;10(3):e22771. doi: 10.2196/22771.,Li T,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/03/10,PMC7991980,,10.2196/22771,"BACKGROUND: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common source of distress among women during and after pregnancy. It has a negative effect on quality of life but with poor care-seeking. Mobile health (mHealth) may be a promising solution with potential advantages. However, there is uncertainty whether a mobile app is effective for SUI symptom improvement during and after pregnancy. The implementation is also unclear. We developed an app named UIW (Urinary Incontinence for Women) aimed at improving perinatal incontinence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the UIW app-based intervention in improving SUI symptoms among pregnant women and explore the facilitators and barriers to using the UIW app to help refine and optimize the intervention. METHODS: This study is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial with a randomized controlled trial alongside a mixed-methods process evaluation according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Pregnant women with SUI (n=336) will be recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in China. They will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either the intervention group that receive usual care plus UIW app or control group that receive usual care alone. The intervention period will last 2 months. The 5 dimensions of the RE-AIM framework will be evaluated at recruitment (-T1), baseline (T0), immediately after intervention (T1), 42 days after delivery (T2), 3 months after delivery (T3), and 6 months after delivery (T4) through project documents, online questionnaires and a pelvic floor muscle training diary, surface electromyography, log data in the background management system, and qualitative interviews. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Descriptive statistics, t tests, chi-square tests, and a linear mixed model will be used to analyze the quantitative data. Deductive and inductive content analysis will be used to analyze the qualitative data. RESULTS: The effectiveness-implementation trial started in June 2020, trial recruitment was completed in October 2020, and the intervention will last for a 2-month period. Completion of the 6-month follow-up will be in July 2021, and we anticipate that the results of this study will be published in December 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate both effectiveness and implementation of the UIW app-based intervention among pregnant women. The hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial design according to the RE-AIM framework with a mixed-methods approach will give valuable insights into the effects as well as facilitators and barriers to the implementation that will influence the effects of the UIW app-based intervention.

Adding Mobile Elements to Online Physical Activity Interventions Targeted at Adults Aged 50 Years and Older: Protocol for a Systematic Design,"Collombon EHGM, Bolman CAW, Peels DA, de Bruijn GJ, de Groot RHM, Lechner L.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Jul 12;11(7):e31677. doi: 10.2196/31677.,Collombon EHGM,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/07/12,PMC9328785,,10.2196/31677,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) can increase mental and physical health in adults aged 50 years and older. However, it has been shown that PA guidelines are often not met within this population. Therefore, our research group developed 2 computer-tailored intervention programs in the last decade to stimulate PA: Active Plus and I Move. Although these programs were proven effective, positive effects diminished over time and attrition rates were relatively high. To respond to this, we will integrate 3 interactive mobile elements into the existing programs: activity tracker, ecological momentary intervention program, and virtual coach app. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research is to define systematic and evidence-based steps for extending our online computer-based PA intervention programs with 3 interactive mobile elements. METHODS: Components often included in other (eHealth) design models were identified as key components and served as a base for the definition of systematic steps: exploration of context, involvement of the target population, prototype and intervention testing, and implementation. Based on these key components, 10 systematic steps were defined. The initial step is a literature search, with the results serving as a base for development of the low-fidelity prototypes in step 2. The pilot phase comprises the 3rd to 6th steps and includes semistructured interviews, pilot tests, and adaptations of the prototypes with intensive involvement of the target population of adults aged 50 years and older, where particular attention will be paid to lower educated persons. The 7th step is an effect evaluation in the form of a randomized controlled trial. During the 8th step, the most effective intervention programs will be selected and reinforced. These reinforced intervention programs will be used during the design of an implementation plan in the 9th step and the subsequent field study in the 10th step. RESULTS: The project will be executed from December 2019 to December 2023. During this period, the systematic approach presented will be practically executed according to the methodological procedures described. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 4 identified key components, we were able to design an evidence-based systematic design approach for separately adding 3 mobile elements to our existing online PA intervention programs. The 10 steps are presented as a useful approach to guide future eHealth design studies. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/31677."
Mobile health strategies for blood pressure self-management in urban populations with digital barriers: systematic review and meta-analyses,"Khoong EC, Olazo K, Rivadeneira NA, Thatipelli S, Barr-Walker J, Fontil V, Lyles CR, Sarkar U.",NPJ Digit Med. 2021 Jul 22;4(1):114. doi: 10.1038/s41746-021-00486-5.,Khoong EC,NPJ Digit Med,2021,2021/07/23,PMC8298448,,10.1038/s41746-021-00486-5,"Mobile health (mHealth) technologies improve hypertension outcomes, but it is unknown if this benefit applies to all populations. This review aimed to describe the impact of mHealth interventions on blood pressure outcomes in populations with disparities in digital health use. We conducted a systematic search to identify studies with systolic blood pressure (SBP) outcomes located in urban settings in high-income countries that included a digital health disparity population, defined as mean age >/=65 years; lower educational attainment (>/=60% </=high school education); and/or racial/ethnic minority (<50% non-Hispanic White for US studies). Interventions were categorized using an established self-management taxonomy. We conducted a narrative synthesis; among randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with a six-month SBP outcome, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses. Twenty-nine articles (representing 25 studies) were included, of which 15 were RCTs. Fifteen studies used text messaging; twelve used mobile applications. Studies were included based on race/ethnicity (14), education (10), and/or age (6). Common intervention components were: lifestyle advice (20); provision of self-monitoring equipment (17); and training on digital device use (15). In the meta-analyses of seven RCTs, SBP reduction at 6-months in the intervention group (mean SBP difference = -4.10, 95% CI: [-6.38, -1.83]) was significant, but there was no significant difference in SBP change between the intervention and control groups (p = 0.48). The use of mHealth tools has shown promise for chronic disease management but few studies have included older, limited educational attainment, or minority populations. Additional robust studies with these populations are needed to determine what interventions work best for diverse hypertensive patients."
mHealth versus face-to-face: study protocol for a randomized trial to test a gender-focused intervention for young African American women at risk for HIV in North Carolina,"Browne FA, Wechsberg WM, Kizakevich PN, Zule WA, Bonner CP, Madison AN, Howard BN, Turner LB.",BMC Public Health. 2018 Aug 6;18(1):982. doi: 10.1186/s12889-018-5796-8.,Browne FA,BMC Public Health,2018,2018/08/08,PMC6080398,,10.1186/s12889-018-5796-8,"BACKGROUND: Disparities in the prevalence of HIV persist in the southern United States, and young African American women have a disproportionate burden of HIV as compared with young women of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. As a result, engaging young African American women in the HIV care continuum through HIV testing is imperative. This study is designed to reach this key population at risk for HIV. The study seeks to test the efficacy of two formats of a gender-focused, evidence-based, HIV-risk reduction intervention-the Young Women's CoOp (YWC)-relative to HIV counseling and testing (HCT) among young African American women between the ages of 18 and 25 who use substances and have not recently been tested for HIV. METHODS: Using a seek-and-test framework, this three-arm cross-over randomized trial is being conducted in three county health departments in North Carolina. Each county is assigned to one of three study arms in each cycle: in-person (face-to-face) YWC, mobile Health (mHealth) YWC, or HCT. At study enrollment, participants complete a risk behavior survey via audio computer-assisted self-interview, and drug, alcohol, and pregnancy screening tests, and are then referred to HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing through their respective health departments. Participants in either of the YWC arms are asked to return approximately 1 week later to either begin the first of two in-person individual intervention sessions or to pick up the mHealth intervention preloaded on a tablet after a brief introduction to using the app. Participants in all arms are asked to return for a 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up, and repeat the survey and biological testing from baseline. DISCUSSION: The findings from this study will demonstrate which delivery format (mHealth or face-to-face) is efficacious in reducing substance use and sexual risk behaviors. If found to be efficacious, the intervention has potential for wider dissemination and reach. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02965014 . Registered November 16, 2016."
Novel technology as platform for interventions for caregivers and individuals with severe mental health illnesses: A systematic review,"Meyer TD, Casarez R, Mohite SS, La Rosa N, Iyengar MS.",J Affect Disord. 2018 Jan 15;226:169-177. doi: 10.1016/j.jad.2017.09.012. Epub 2017 Sep 14.,Meyer TD,J Affect Disord,2018,2017/10/09,,,10.1016/j.jad.2017.09.012,"BACKGROUND: Severe mental illnesses (SMIs) have been found to be associated with both increases in morbidity-mortality, need for treatment care in patients themselves, and burden for relatives as caregivers. A growing number of web-based and mobile software applications have appeared that aim to address various barriers with respect to access to care. Our objective was to review and summarize recent advancements in such interventions for caregivers of individuals with a SMI. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for papers evaluating interactive mobile or web-based software (using no or only minimal support from a professional) specifically aimed at supporting informal caregivers. We also searched for those supporting patients with SMI so as to not to miss any which might include relatives. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1673 initial hits, we identified 11 articles reporting on 9 different mobile or web-based software programs. The main result is that none of those studies focused on caregivers, and the ones we identified using mobile or web-based applications were just for patients and not their relatives. LIMITATIONS: Differentiating between online and offline available software might not always have been totally reliable, and we might have therefore missed some studies. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the studies provided evidence that remotely accessible interventions for patients with SMI are feasible and acceptable to patients. No such empirically evaluated program was available for informal caregivers such as relatives. Keeping in mind the influential role of those informal caregivers in the process of treatment and self-management, this is highly relevant for public health. Supporting informal caregivers can improve well-being of both caregivers and patients."
Tough Talks COVID-19 Digital Health Intervention for Vaccine Hesitancy Among Black Young Adults: Protocol for a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness Implementation Randomized Controlled Trial,"Budhwani H, Maragh-Bass AC, Tolley EE, Comello MLG, Stoner MCD, Adams Larsen M, Brambilla D, Muessig KE, Pettifor A, Bond CL, Toval C, Hightow-Weidman LB.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Feb 13;12:e41240. doi: 10.2196/41240.,Budhwani H,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/01/23,PMC9930921,,10.2196/41240,"BACKGROUND: Interventions for increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among Black young adults are central to ending the pandemic. Black young adults experience harms from structural forces, such as racism and stigma, that reduce receptivity to traditional public health messaging due to skepticism and distrust. As such, Black young adults continue to represent a priority population on which to focus efforts for promoting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. OBJECTIVE: In aims 1 and 2, the Tough Talks digital health intervention for HIV disclosure will be adapted to address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and tailored to the experiences of Black young adults in the southern United States (Tough Talks for COVID-19). In aim 3, the newly adapted Tough Talks for COVID-19 digital health intervention will be tested across the following three southern states: Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. METHODS: Our innovative digital health intervention study will include qualitative and quantitative assessments. A unique combination of methodological techniques, including web-based surveys, choose-your-own-adventures, digital storytelling, user acceptability testing, and community-based participatory approaches, will culminate in a 2-arm hybrid type 1 effectiveness implementation randomized controlled trial, wherein participants will be randomized to the Tough Talks for COVID-19 intervention arm or a standard-of-care control condition (N=360). Logistic regression will be used to determine the effect of the treatment arm on the probability of vaccination uptake (primary COVID-19 vaccine series or recommended boosters). Concurrently, the inner and outer contexts of implementation will be ascertained and catalogued to inform future scale-up. Florida State University's institutional review board approved the study (STUDY00003617). RESULTS: Our study was funded at the end of April 2021. Aim 1 data collection concluded in early 2022. The entire study is expected to conclude in January 2025. CONCLUSIONS: If effective, our digital health intervention will be poised for broad, rapid dissemination to reduce COVID-19 mortality among unvaccinated Black young adults in the southern United States. Our findings will have the potential to inform efforts that seek to address medical mistrust through participatory approaches.

A Systematic Review of eHealth Interventions Addressing HIV/STI Prevention Among Men Who Have Sex With Men,"Nguyen LH, Tran BX, Rocha LEC, Nguyen HLT, Yang C, Latkin CA, Thorson A, Strömdahl S.",AIDS Behav. 2019 Sep;23(9):2253-2272. doi: 10.1007/s10461-019-02626-1.,Nguyen LH,AIDS Behav,2019,2019/08/12,PMC6766471,,10.1007/s10461-019-02626-1,"A systematic review was conducted to summarize and appraise the eHealth interventions addressing HIV/STI prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM), and characterize features of successful eHealth interventions. Fifty-five articles (17 pilots and 38 full efficacy trials) were included with the predominance of web-based interventions in the United States-based settings. Intervention modalities include web-based, short message service (SMS)/text messges/email reminder, online video-based, computer-assisted, multimedia-based, social network, live chat and chat room, virtual simulation intervention, and smartphone applications. Forty-nine eHealth interventions achieved a short-term behaviour change among participants. Four studies were conducted with 12-month follow-ups; and only one of them could maintain the behaviour change over this longer time period which could be due to the lack of booster interventions. Our study suggests that eHealth interventions can achieve short term behaviour change among MSM, however limited interventions could maintain behaviour change over 12 months. Further eHealth intervention strategies to promote HIV prevention among MSM should be conducted and rigorously evaluated."
Potential and Pitfalls of Mobile Mental Health Apps in Traditional Treatment: An Umbrella Review,"Koh J, Tng GYQ, Hartanto A.",J Pers Med. 2022 Aug 25;12(9):1376. doi: 10.3390/jpm12091376.,Koh J,J Pers Med,2022,2022/09/23,PMC9505389,,10.3390/jpm12091376,"While the rapid growth of mobile mental health applications has offered an avenue of support unbridled by physical distance, time, and cost, the digitalization of traditional interventions has also triggered doubts surrounding their effectiveness and safety. Given the need for a more comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of mobile mental health apps in traditional treatment, this umbrella review provides a holistic summary of their key potential and pitfalls. A total of 36 reviews published between 2014 and 2022-including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, and literature reviews-were identified from the Cochrane library, Medline (via PubMed Central), and Scopus databases. The majority of results supported the key potential of apps in helping to (1) provide timely support, (2) ease the costs of mental healthcare, (3) combat stigma in help-seeking, and (4) enhance therapeutic outcomes. Our results also identified common themes of apps' pitfalls (i.e., challenges faced by app users), including (1) user engagement issues, (2) safety issues in emergencies, (3) privacy and confidentiality breaches, and (4) the utilization of non-evidence-based approaches. We synthesize the potential and pitfalls of mental health apps provided by the reviews and outline critical avenues for future research."
mHealth Interventions to Improve the Breast Cancer Continuum of Care from Prevention to Survivorship of Hispanic Women: A Scoping Review,"Granda-Cameron C, Kates J, Wen KY.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities. 2023 Jun 26. doi: 10.1007/s40615-023-01658-7. Online ahead of print.,Granda-Cameron C,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,2023,2023/06/26,,,10.1007/s40615-023-01658-7,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in Hispanic women in the USA. Current interventions to improve breast cancer care include the use of mHealth, but its application in Hispanic women is limited. This scoping review aimed to describe the extent of research literature on the use of mHealth throughout the breast cancer care continuum (prevention, early detection, and treatment) in Hispanic women. METHODS: A scoping review guided by the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework and the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review reporting protocol. Literature search of peer-reviewed research articles from 2012 to 2022 in PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL(R) was conducted in March and June 2022. RESULTS: Of the 10 articles selected, seven included Hispanic breast cancer survivors and three included Hispanic women at risk for developing breast cancer. Seven articles involved mobile applications and three articles used text messaging and/or cell phone voicemail. Overall, the use of mHealth for breast cancer care in Hispanics was favorable but generalizability was limited given the type of design and small samples. All interventions were tailored to Hispanic culture. CONCLUSION: Scarcity of research on mHealth in Hispanic breast cancer care highlights healthcare disparities in this population. Evidence from this review suggests the use of mHealth to be beneficial to improving breast cancer care in Hispanics, but more research is needed involving randomized clinical trials and larger samples."
"Mobile Phone Ownership and Endorsement of ""mHealth"" Among People With Psychosis: A Meta-analysis of Cross-sectional Studies","Firth J, Cotter J, Torous J, Bucci S, Firth JA, Yung AR.",Schizophr Bull. 2016 Mar;42(2):448-55. doi: 10.1093/schbul/sbv132. Epub 2015 Sep 22.,Firth J,Schizophr Bull,2016,2015/09/25,PMC4753601,,10.1093/schbul/sbv132,"There is currently growing interest in using mobile phones to support the treatment of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. However, the widespread implementation of these interventions will ultimately depend upon patients' access to mobile devices and their willingness to engage with mobile health (""mHealth""). Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess mobile phone ownership and interest in mHealth among patients with psychosis. An electronic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, AMED, Health Technology Assessment Database, and Health Management Information Consortium Database was conducted, using search terms synonymous with mobile phones and psychotic disorders. The initial literature search yielded 2572 results. Fifteen studies matched eligibility criteria, reporting data from 12 independent samples of psychiatric patients (n = 3227). Data pertaining to mobile phone ownership, usage, and opinions on mHealth among patients with psychotic disorders were extracted from these studies, and meta-analytic techniques were applied. The overall mobile phone ownership rate was 66.4% (95% CI = 54.1%-77.6%). However, we found strong statistical evidence that mobile phone ownership has been significantly increasing since 2007, and the rate among patients surveyed in the last 2 years was 81.4% (n = 454). Furthermore, in surveys of mHealth acceptability, the majority of patients responded in favor of using mobile phones to enhance contact with services and support self-management. Considering the increasing availability of mobile phones and the broad acceptability of mHealth among patients, there is now a need to develop and evaluate mHealth interventions to enhance healthcare services for people with psychosis."
The Adoption and Acceptance of mHealth Interventions for Self-Management of Hypertension Among Adult Patients: A Systematic Review,"Alzahrani SA, Bin Muammar MF, Bin Muammar AF, Alolah A, Almutawa M.",Cureus. 2022 Nov 16;14(11):e31584. doi: 10.7759/cureus.31584. eCollection 2022 Nov.,Alzahrani SA,Cureus,2022,2022/12/21,PMC9757619,,10.7759/cureus.31584,"Hypertension is a worldwide epidemic that affects healthcare costs and public health. As a result, self-management of this disease and, in this context, mobile health (mHealth) can be used as a cost-effective management tool. Self-management of hypertension remains of great significance due to the rising number of hypertension cases. As a result, this study aimed to assess the various mobile health interventions used in the self-management of hypertension, their user acceptability, compliance, and adherence to hypertension treatment, and their effectiveness. Some mobile health techniques are automated text and video messages. These mobile applications allow for self-monitoring and communication between the patients and the health service providers, reminders, and automated signals. The abovementioned interventions are promising tools in helping manage blood pressure (BP), but resources are limited. This review involved selecting studies associated with mobile health interventions in managing hypertension and extracting data from available resources. Thirteen studies were selected using the inclusion criteria, and relevant data were extracted and discussed in the review. This review reported the role of mobile health interventions in the management of blood pressure, as most studies noted a decrease in blood pressure and increased medication adherence and self-efficacy. It also reported a reliable communication channel between the participants and their health service providers."
Digital Technology Interventions for Risk Factor Modification in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Akinosun AS, Polson R, Diaz-Skeete Y, De Kock JH, Carragher L, Leslie S, Grindle M, Gorely T.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2021 Mar 3;9(3):e21061. doi: 10.2196/21061.,Akinosun AS,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2021,2021/03/03,PMC7970167,,10.2196/21061,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of cardiovascular disease (CVD) cases are attributable to lifestyle risk factors. Despite widespread education, personal knowledge, and efficacy, many individuals fail to adequately modify these risk factors, even after a cardiovascular event. Digital technology interventions have been suggested as a viable equivalent and potential alternative to conventional cardiac rehabilitation care centers. However, little is known about the clinical effectiveness of these technologies in bringing about behavioral changes in patients with CVD at an individual level. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify and measure the effectiveness of digital technology (eg, mobile phones, the internet, software applications, wearables, etc) interventions in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and determine which behavior change constructs are effective at achieving risk factor modification in patients with CVD. METHODS: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs designed according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) statement standard. Mixed data from studies extracted from selected research databases and filtered for RCTs only were analyzed using quantitative methods. Outcome hypothesis testing was set at 95% CI and P=.05 for statistical significance. RESULTS: Digital interventions were delivered using devices such as cell phones, smartphones, personal computers, and wearables coupled with technologies such as the internet, SMS, software applications, and mobile sensors. Behavioral change constructs such as cognition, follow-up, goal setting, record keeping, perceived benefit, persuasion, socialization, personalization, rewards and incentives, support, and self-management were used. The meta-analyzed effect estimates (mean difference [MD]; standard mean difference [SMD]; and risk ratio [RR]) calculated for outcomes showed benefits in total cholesterol SMD at -0.29 [-0.44, -0.15], P<.001; high-density lipoprotein SMD at -0.09 [-0.19, 0.00], P=.05; low-density lipoprotein SMD at -0.18 [-0.33, -0.04], P=.01; physical activity (PA) SMD at 0.23 [0.11, 0.36], P<.001; physical inactivity (sedentary) RR at 0.54 [0.39, 0.75], P<.001; and diet (food intake) RR at 0.79 [0.66, 0.94], P=.007. Initial effect estimates showed no significant benefit in body mass index (BMI) MD at -0.37 [-1.20, 0.46], P=.38; diastolic blood pressure (BP) SMD at -0.06 [-0.20, 0.08], P=.43; systolic BP SMD at -0.03 [-0.18, 0.13], P=.74; Hemoglobin A(1C) blood sugar (HbA(1c)) RR at 1.04 [0.40, 2.70], P=.94; alcohol intake SMD at -0.16 [-1.43, 1.10], P=.80; smoking RR at 0.87 [0.67, 1.13], P=.30; and medication adherence RR at 1.10 [1.00, 1.22], P=.06. CONCLUSIONS: Digital interventions may improve healthy behavioral factors (PA, healthy diet, and medication adherence) and are even more potent when used to treat multiple behavioral outcomes (eg, medication adherence plus). However, they did not appear to reduce unhealthy behavioral factors (smoking, alcohol intake, and unhealthy diet) and clinical outcomes (BMI, triglycerides, diastolic and systolic BP, and HbA(1c))."
Mobile Health Interventions for Self-Control of Unhealthy Alcohol Use: Systematic Review,"Song T, Qian S, Yu P.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Jan 29;7(1):e10899. doi: 10.2196/10899.,Song T,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/01/30,PMC6371076,,10.2196/10899,"BACKGROUND: Unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) is one of the major causes of preventable morbidity, mortality, and associated behavioral risks worldwide. Although mobile health (mHealth) interventions can provide consumers with an effective means for self-control of UAU in a timely, ubiquitous, and cost-effective manner, to date, there is a lack of understanding about different health outcomes brought by such interventions. The core components of these interventions are also unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review and synthesize the research evidence about the efficacy of mHealth interventions on various health outcomes for consumer self-control of UAU and to identify the core components to achieve these outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched 7 electronic interdisciplinary databases: Scopus, PubMed, PubMed Central, CINAHL Plus with full text, MEDLINE with full text, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES. Search terms and Medical Subject Headings ""mHealth,"" ""text message,"" ""SMS,"" ""App,"" ""IVR,"" ""self-control,"" ""self-regulation,"" ""alcohol*,"" and ""intervention"" were used individually or in combination to identify peer-reviewed publications in English from 2008 to 2017. We screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text papers as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted from the included papers according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-EHEALTH checklist (V 1.6.1) by 2 authors independently. Data quality was assessed by the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data synthesis and analyses were conducted following the procedures for qualitative content analysis. Statistical testing was also conducted to test differences among groups of studies. RESULTS: In total, 19 studies were included in the review. Of these 19 studies, 12 (63%) mHealth interventions brought significant positive outcomes in improving participants' health as measured by behavioral (n=11), physiological (n=1), and cognitive indicators (n=1). No significant health outcome was reported in 6 studies (6/19, 32%). Surprisingly, a significant negative outcome was reported for the male participants in the intervention arm in 1 study (1/19, 5%), but no change was found for the female participants. In total, 5 core components reported in the mHealth interventions for consumer self-control of UAU were context, theoretical base, delivery mode, content, and implementation procedure. However, sound evidence is yet to be generated about the role of each component for mHealth success. The health outcomes were similar regardless of types of UAU, deployment setting, with or without nonmobile cointervention, and with or without theory. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies reported mHealth interventions for self-control of UAU appeared to be improving behavior, especially the ones delivered by short message service and interactive voice response systems. Further studies are needed to gather sound evidence about the effects of mHealth interventions on improving physiological and cognitive outcomes as well as the optimal design of these interventions, their implementation, and effects in supporting self-control of UAU."
Physical activity for pediatric cancer survivors: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"Cheung AT, Li WHC, Ho LLK, Ho KY, Chan GCF, Chung JOK.",J Cancer Surviv. 2021 Dec;15(6):876-889. doi: 10.1007/s11764-020-00981-w. Epub 2021 Jan 3.,Cheung AT,J Cancer Surviv,2021,2021/01/03,PMC7778568,,10.1007/s11764-020-00981-w,"PURPOSE: To collate evidence and evaluate the effects of physical activity interventions on physical activity level among pediatric cancer survivors who had completed active cancer treatment. METHODS: Relevant published studies were identified in May 2020 via five databases and reference checking. Searches were limited to randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials, published in English involving pediatric cancer survivors aged 18 years or below. Interventions were related to promote physical activity among the survivors. Included studies were assessed using the revised version of the Cochrane's Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials (620 pediatric cancer survivors and 53 caregivers of pediatric cancer survivors) were included. All studies investigated interventions for pediatric cancer survivors to increase their physical activity level. The interventions used varied across the eight included studies: three mHealth-medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices; two eHealth-the use of information and communication technologies to improve health care; two adventure-based training; and one educational program. Measures of physical activity level also varied: five used various objective measurements (i.e., accelerometer, pedometer, multisensory activity monitor); three used different self-reported questionnaires. Owing to high variability of the interventions and measures, it was impossible to perform meta-analysis. Overall, eHealth and mHealth interventions showed effectiveness and feasibility to promote physical activity among pediatric cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth and mHealth interventions appear to be increasingly important strategies to promote physical activity among pediatric cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Future larger-scale studies using a core-set of assessment tools are warranted to further promote regular physical activity in pediatric cancer survivors."

Fourteen studies (10 RCTs, 4 non-RCTs) published between 2000 and 2022 were included. While app-based interventions did not significantly improve clinical outcomes like HbA1c and blood pressure, they showed a statistically significant reduction in symptom severity of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms (PTSD), depression, and insomnia. Patients expressed satisfaction with the apps, though statistical significance was not reported. In addition to alleviating mental health symptoms, mHealth apps appear widely accepted by military personnel. Development and implementation of evidence-based mental health apps by healthcare professionals are recommended."
Co-designing a Sexual Health App With Immigrant Adolescents: Protocol for a Qualitative Community-Based Participatory Action Research Study,"Meherali S, Munro S, Puinean G, Salami B, Wong JP, Vandermorris A, Benoit JRA, Flicker S, Okeke-Ihejirika P, Stroulia E, Norman WV, Scott SD.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Mar 22;12:e45389. doi: 10.2196/45389.,Meherali S,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/03/22,PMC10131995,,10.2196/45389,"BACKGROUND: Canada is one of the world's most ethnically diverse countries, with over 7 million individuals out of a population of 38 million being born in a foreign country. Immigrant adolescents (aged 10 to 19 years) make up a substantial proportion of newcomers to Canada. Religious and cultural practices can influence adolescents' sexual attitudes and behaviors, as well as the uptake of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services among this population. Adolescence is a time to establish lifelong healthy behaviors. Research indicates an alarming gap in adolescents' SRH knowledge, yet there is limited research on the SRH needs of immigrant adolescents in Canada. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to actively engage with immigrant adolescents to develop, implement, and evaluate a mobile health (mHealth) intervention (ie, mobile app). The interactive mobile app will aim to deliver accurate and evidence-based SRH information to adolescents. METHODS: We will use community-based participatory action research to guide our study. This research project will be conducted in 4 stages based on user-centered co-design principles. In Stage 1 (Empathize), we will recruit and convene 3 adolescent advisory groups in Edmonton, Toronto, and Vancouver. Members will be engaged as coresearchers and receive training in qualitative and quantitative methodologies, sexual health, and the social determinants of health. In Stage 2 (Define and Ideate), we will explore SRH information and service needs through focus group discussions with immigrant adolescents. In Stage 3 (Prototype), we will collaborate with mobile developers to build and iteratively design the app with support from the adolescent advisory groups. Finally, in Stage 4 (Test), we will return to focus group settings to share the app prototype, gather feedback on usability, and refine and release the app. RESULTS: Recruitment and data collection will be completed by February 2023, and mobile app development will begin in March 2023. The mHealth app will be our core output and is expected to be released in the spring of 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Our study will advance the limited knowledge base on SRH and the information needs of immigrant adolescents in Canada as well as the science underpinning participatory action research methods with immigrant adolescents. This study will address gaps by exploring SRH priorities, health information needs, and innovative strategies to improve the SRH of immigrant adolescents. Engaging adolescents throughout the study will increase their involvement in SRH care decision-making, expand efficiencies in SRH care utilization, and ultimately improve adolescents' SRH outcomes. The app we develop will be transferable to all adolescent groups, is scalable in international contexts, and simultaneously leverages significant economies of scale.

Effectiveness of Mobile App-Based Psychological Interventions for College Students: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Oliveira C, Pereira A, Vagos P, Nóbrega C, Gonçalves J, Afonso B.",Front Psychol. 2021 May 11;12:647606. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647606. eCollection 2021.,Oliveira C,Front Psychol,2021,2021/05/28,PMC8144454,,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647606,"Serious mental health disorders are increasing among college students and university counseling services are often overburdened. Mobile applications for mental health have been growing exponentially in the last decade and they are emerging in university settings as a promising tool to promote and intervene in college students' mental health. Additionally, considering the recent covid-19 pandemic, mHealth interventions, due to its nature and possibilities, may play an important role in these institutions. Our main objectives are to explore mhealth interventions in universities, regarding its conceptual framework, acceptability and efficacy outcomes and understand its impact and contributions to address treatment delivery and psychological difficulties resulting from covid-19 pandemic. The literature search was conducted in scientific databases, namely, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus. A search in app stores was not conducted, thus regarding commercially available apps, only those found in our database search were included in our review. We selected studies with mobile applications addressing psychological interventions for college students. A total of 2,158 participants were included in the 8 selected studies and most interventions were delivered through mobile apps only and based in cognitive behavioral therapy. Results suggested that college students accept and adhere to these interventions and preliminary evidence of efficacy was demonstrated in different disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression and risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco abuse and sexual knowledge. We conclude that universities, particularly college counseling services, may benefit from mhealth interventions, not only to address college students' mental health but to decrease some of its difficulties related to lack of human resources. Specifically in covid-19 pandemic context, these interventions may contribute significantly by promoting and delivering psychological interventions at a safe distance."
Impact of eHealth technologies on patient outcomes: a meta-analysis of chronic gastrointestinal illness interventions,"Rohde JA, Barker JO, Noar SM.",Transl Behav Med. 2021 Feb 11;11(1):1-10. doi: 10.1093/tbm/ibz166.,Rohde JA,Transl Behav Med,2021,2019/11/16,,,10.1093/tbm/ibz166,"Gastrointestinal (GI) illness interventions are increasingly utilizing eHealth technologies, yet little is currently known about the extent of their impact on patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the GI eHealth intervention literature. We used a comprehensive search strategy to locate studies. To be included, studies had to be a randomized controlled trial comparing an eHealth intervention condition against a no-treatment or waitlist control condition. Studies had to report data on at least one of the following patient outcomes: medication adherence, quality of life (QoL), psychological distress, illness-related knowledge, or number of patient visits to the clinic/hospital. Analyses weighted effect sizes (d) by their inverse variance and combined them using random effects meta-analytic procedures. K = 19 studies conducted in eight countries with a cumulative sample size of N = 3,193 were meta-analyzed. Findings indicated that GI eHealth interventions improved patients' QoL (d = .25, p = .008), psychological distress (d = .24, p = .017), medication adherence (d = .17, p = .014), and illness-related knowledge (d = .19, p = .002). GI eHealth interventions also significantly reduced the number of patient visits to the clinic/hospital (d = .78, p = .005). Our findings suggest that eHealth interventions hold promise in improving patient outcomes for those with GI illnesses. We suggest the next generation of GI interventions continue developing and evaluating the impact of technology using randomized controlled trial designs, and perhaps consider adapting existing efficacious interventions for burgeoning platforms, such as smartphones and tablets."

METHODS: All relevant articles published until September 2021 were systematically identified from six electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, RISS, and KISS. Data selection and extraction were independently performed by three researchers. Methodological quality was assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials. The results were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the systematic review. All studies had a low risk of bias. The settings and sample sizes of the included studies were different. The contents of the interventions included nutrition, physical activity, behavioral change, incentives, and motivation. Four studies were based on social cognitive theory. A total of ten studies delivered web-based intervention, while the other used tele-monitoring device. A wide range of intervention strategies was used including providing online resources, tele-counseling, and patient-tailored advice. As a result of the intervention, a total of seven studies showed a significant weight reduction in both the intervention and comparison groups, with significant differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Until now, use of digital health in weight reduction interventions for employees with obesity has been conducted on a web-based. Various contents such as nutrition, physical activity and theories were explored. Further study is required using more diverse delivery methods such as mobile application, use of wearable devices."
Cultural and Contextual Adaptation of an eHealth Intervention for Youth Receiving Services for First-Episode Psychosis: Adaptation Framework and Protocol for Horyzons-Canada Phase 1,"Lal S, Gleeson J, Malla A, Rivard L, Joober R, Chandrasena R, Alvarez-Jimenez M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2018 Apr 23;7(4):e100. doi: 10.2196/resprot.8810.,Lal S,JMIR Res Protoc,2018,2018/04/25,PMC5938599,,10.2196/resprot.8810,"BACKGROUND: eHealth interventions have the potential to address challenges related to access, service engagement, and continuity of care in the delivery of mental health services. However, the initial development and evaluation of such interventions can require substantive amounts of financial and human resource investments to bring them to scale. Therefore, it may be warranted to pay greater attention to policy, services, and research with respect to eHealth platforms that have the potential to be adapted for use across settings. Yet, limited attention has been placed on the methods and processes for adapting eHealth interventions to improve their applicability across cultural, geographical, and contextual boundaries. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe an adaptation framework and protocol to adapt an eHealth intervention designed to promote recovery and prevent relapses in youth receiving specialized services for first-episode psychosis. The Web-based platform, called Horyzons, was initially developed and tested in Australia and is now being prepared for evaluation in Canada. METHODS: Service users and service providers from 2 specialized early intervention programs for first-episode psychosis located in different provinces will explore a beta-version of the eHealth intervention through focus group discussions and extended personal explorations to identify the need for, and content of contextual and cultural adaptations. An iterative consultation process will then take place with service providers and users to develop and assess platform adaptations in preparation for a pilot study with a live version of the platform. RESULTS: Data collection was completed in August 2017, and analysis and adaptation are in process. The first results of the study will be submitted for publication in 2018 and will provide preliminary insights into the acceptability of the Web-based platform (eg, perceived use and perceived usefulness) from service provider and service user perspectives. The project will also provide knowledge about the adaptations and process needed to prepare the platform for evaluation in Canada. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to an important gap in the literature pertaining to the specific principles, methods, and steps involved in adapting eHealth interventions for implementation and evaluation across a diverse range of cultural, geographical, and health care settings."

Several studies have demonstrated that Internet-based interventions have positive effects on drinking habits among university students. Our recent study evaluated two mobile phone apps targeting drinking choices at party occasions via personalized feedback on estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) for students with hazardous drinking. No changes in drinking parameters were found over a seven-week period apart from an increase in number of drinking occasions among men for one of the apps tested. Up to 30% of the study participants drank at potentially harmful levels: higher than the national recommended number of standard drinks per week (a maximum of 9 for women and 14 for men) in Sweden. OBJECTIVE: (1) To evaluate improved versions of the two mobile phone apps tested in our prior trial, in a new, 3-armed randomized controlled trial among university students with at least hazardous drinking habits according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identifications Test (AUDIT; Study 1). (2) After 6 weeks, to target study participants showing alcohol consumption higher than the national recommended levels for standard drinks per week by offering them participation in a second, 2-armed randomized trial evaluating an additional mobile phone app with skill enhancement tasks (Study 2). (3) To follow participants at 6, 12 and 18 weeks after recruitment to Study 1 and at 6 and 12 weeks after recruitment to Study 2. METHODS: Two randomized controlled trials are conducted. Study 1: Students are recruited at four Swedish universities, via direct e-mail and advertisements on Facebook and student union web sites. Those who provide informed consent, have a mobile phone, and show at least hazardous alcohol consumption according to the AUDIT (>/=6 for women; >/=8 points for men) are randomized into three groups. Group 1 has access to the Swedish government alcohol monopoly's app, Promillekoll, offering real-time estimated eBAC calculation; Group 2 has access to a Web-based app, PartyPlanner, developed by the research group, offering real-time eBAC calculation with planning and follow-up functions; and Group 3 participants are controls. Follow-up is conducted at 6, 12 and 18 weeks. Study 2. Participants who at the first 6-week follow-up show drinking levels higher than 9 (W) or 14 (M) standard drinks (12 g alcohol) per week, are offered participation in Study 2. Those who consent are randomized to either access to a skills training app, TeleCoach or to a wait-list control group. RESULTS: Latent Markov models for Study 1 and mixed models analyses for Study 2 will be performed. Study 2 data will be analyzed for publication during the spring of 2016; Study 1 data will be analyzed for publication during the fall of 2016. CONCLUSIONS: If mobile phone interventions for reducing hazardous alcohol use are found to be effective, the prospects for positively influencing substance use-related health among university students can considerably improve.

eHealth interventions for parents in neonatal intensive care units: a systematic review,"Dol J, Delahunty-Pike A, Anwar Siani S, Campbell-Yeo M.",JBI Database System Rev Implement Rep. 2017 Dec;15(12):2981-3005. doi: 10.11124/JBISRIR-2017-003439.,Dol J,JBI Database System Rev Implement Rep,2017,2017/12/09,,,10.11124/JBISRIR-2017-003439,"BACKGROUND: As technology becomes increasingly more advanced, particularly video technology and interactive learning platforms, some neonatal intensive care units are embracing electronic health (eHealth) technologies to enhance and expand their family-centered care environments. Despite the emergence of eHealth, there has been a lack of systematic evaluation of its effectiveness thus far. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of eHealth interventions used in neonatal intensive care units on parent-related and infant outcomes. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: This review considered studies that included parents or primary caregivers of infants requiring care in a neonatal intensive care unit. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S): This review considered studies that evaluated any eHealth interventions in neonatal intensive care units, including education (e.g. web-based platforms, mobile applications); communication (e.g. videos, SMS or text messaging), or a combination of both. Comparators included no eHealth interventions and/or standard care. TYPES OF STUDIES: Experimental and epidemiological study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and analytical cross sectional studies were considered. OUTCOMES: This review considered studies that included parent-related outcomes (use and acceptance, stress/anxiety, confidence, financial impact, satisfaction and technical issues) and neonatal outcomes (length of stay, postmenstrual age at discharge, parental presence and visits). SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search was undertaken across four databases to retrieve published studies in English from inception to November 18, 2016. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information (JBI-SUMARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Quantitative data were extracted from included studies independently by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-SUMARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: A comprehensive meta-analysis for all outcomes was not possible and data has been reported narratively for all outcomes. RESULTS: Eight studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The majority of the studies were low to very low quality. The study design and type of eHealth technology examined varied greatly. There appears to be growing interest in the topic as over half of the included studies were published within the past two years. Primary findings suggest parent acceptance and use of eHealth interventions but an unclear impact on neonatal outcomes, particularly on length of stay, a commonly reported neonatal outcome. Due to the variation in eHealth interventions, and heterogeneity across studies, meta-analysis was not possible. Numerous single studies and small sample sizes limited the degree of adequate strength to determine statistical differences across outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: While heterogeneity across studies precluded meta-analysis, consistent trends across all studies examining parental acceptance of eHealth interventions indicate that parents are willing to accept eHealth interventions as part of their neonatal intensive care, suggesting that the incorporation and evaluation of eHealth interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit setting is warranted. Further high quality studies are needed with larger sample sizes to detect changes in outcomes. As eHealth intervention studies move beyond feasibility and implementation, there is a demand for randomized control trials to examine the effect of eHealth interventions on parent and neonatal outcomes compared to usual care. Future studies should consider reporting of outcomes using standardized measures which would allow comparison across eHealth interventions in subsequent reviews."
The mechanism and effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention for reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A protocol of randomized control trial of ecological momentary intervention and assessment,"Wang Q, Ng SM, Zhou X.",PLoS One. 2023 Sep 13;18(9):e0291168. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0291168. eCollection 2023.,Wang Q,PLoS One,2023,2023/09/13,PMC10499232,,10.1371/journal.pone.0291168,"BACKGROUND: Existing studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents' appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants' cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD. METHOD: The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants' subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress. DISCUSSION: The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future. Trial registration: This trial has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov with the ID of NCT05746468."
Feasibility evaluation of a pain self-management app-based intervention among older people living with arthritic pain: study protocol,"Bhattarai P, Newton-John TRO, Phillips JL.",Pilot Feasibility Stud. 2019 Apr 25;5:57. doi: 10.1186/s40814-019-0442-5. eCollection 2019.,Bhattarai P,Pilot Feasibility Stud,2019,2019/05/07,PMC6485149,,10.1186/s40814-019-0442-5,"BACKGROUND: Optimal management of chronic arthritic pain experienced by older adults involves applying active self-management strategies every day. Cost-effective and innovative strategies to help build older people's pain self-management capability are required. This study protocol is designed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a pain self-management app among older people living in the community with arthritic pain. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a phase I feasibility study. A pre-post test study design will be used to trial a freely available pain self-management app named Rheumatoid Arthritis Information Support and Education (""RAISE"") for 14 days. Thirty community-dwelling older people living with arthritic pain who use a smartphone will be recruited from (1) various community-based social clubs/organizations/groups or (2) via Facebook groups with potentially high number of older members. In addition, snowballing sampling approach will also be utilized.These participants will trial the RAISE app, which was selected following a systematic evaluation of all available chronic pain apps by the investigator team. A face-to-face or telephone-based meeting will be organized with all consenting participants in order to seek their informed consent, download and set up the intervention app on their mobile device, be provided with app training, and complete the pre-test data (Time 1 (T1)). Participants will be asked to use the RAISE app as desired for 14 days. Post-test data collection (Time 2 (T2)) will occur on day 15. Data collected includes participant's demographic and clinical information, pain scores, pain self-efficacy, and online technology self-efficacy. Participants will be invited to take part in a semi-structured telephone interview at T2 to explore their experiences of using the app.An evaluation of patterns of app use, recruitment, retention, attrition rates, and analysis of the missing data will inform the study and intervention feasibility. Preliminary outcomes are participant's pain intensity and interference, pain self-efficacy, and online technology self-efficacy. DISCUSSION: This study will help us better understand the feasibility and acceptability of using this novel intervention among community-dwelling older people living with arthritic pain. The results will also help inform future pain app studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12617000921381."
Digital interventions to moderate physical inactivity and/or nutrition in young people: a Cancer Prevention Europe overview of systematic reviews,"McDermott KT, Noake C, Wolff R, Bauld L, Espina C, Foucaud J, Steindorf K, Thorat MA, Weijenberg MP, Schüz J, Kleijnen J.",Front Digit Health. 2023 Jul 4;5:1185586. doi: 10.3389/fdgth.2023.1185586. eCollection 2023.,McDermott KT,Front Digit Health,2023,2023/08/03,PMC10393256,,10.3389/fdgth.2023.1185586,"BACKGROUND: Strategies to increase physical activity (PA) and improve nutrition would contribute to substantial health benefits in the population, including reducing the risk of several types of cancers. The increasing accessibility of digital technologies mean that these tools could potentially facilitate the improvement of health behaviours among young people. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a review of systematic reviews to assess the available evidence on digital interventions aimed at increasing physical activity and good nutrition in sub-populations of young people (school-aged children, college/university students, young adults only (over 18 years) and both adolescent and young adults (<25 years)). METHODS: Searches for systematic reviews were conducted across relevant databases including KSR Evidence (www.ksrevidence.com), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; CRD). Records were independently screened by title and abstract by two reviewers and those deemed eligible were obtained for full text screening. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool. We employed a narrative analysis and developed evidence gap maps. RESULTS: Twenty-four reviews were included with at least one for each sub-population and employing a range of digital interventions. The quality of evidence was limited with only one of the 24 of reviews overall judged as low RoB. Definitions of ""digital intervention"" greatly varied across systematic reviews with some reported interventions fitting into more than one category (i.e., an internet intervention could also be a mobile phone or computer intervention), however definitions as reported in the relevant reviews were used. No reviews reported cancer incidence or related outcomes. Available evidence was limited both by sub-population and type of intervention, but evidence was most pronounced in school-aged children. In school-aged children eHealth interventions, defined as school-based programmes delivered by the internet, computers, tablets, mobile technology, or tele-health methods, improved outcomes. Accelerometer-measured (Standardised Mean Difference [SMD] 0.33, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.05 to 0.61) and self-reported (SMD: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.23) PA increased, as did fruit and vegetable intake (SMD: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.19) (review rated as low RoB, minimal to considerable heterogeneity across results). No difference was reported for consumption of fat post-intervention (SMD: -0.06, 95% CI: -0.15 to 0.03) or sugar sweetened beverages(SSB) and snack consumption combined post-intervention (SMD: -0.02, 95% CI:-0.10 to 0.06),or at the follow up (studies reported 2 weeks to 36 months follow-up) after the intervention (SMD:-0.06, 95% CI: -0.15 to 0.03) (review rated low ROB, minimal to substantial heterogeneity across results). Smartphone based interventions utilising Short Messaging Service (SMS), app or combined approaches also improved PA measured using objective and subjective methods (SMD: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.77) when compared to controls, with increases in total PA [weighted mean difference (WMD) 32.35 min per day, 95% CI: 10.36 to 54.33] and in daily steps (WMD: 1,185, 95% CI: 303 to 2,068) (review rated as high RoB, moderate to substantial heterogeneity across results). For all results, interpretation has limitations in terms of RoB and presence of unexplained heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: This review of reviews has identified limited evidence that suggests some potential for digital interventions to increase PA and, to lesser extent, improve nutrition in school-aged children. However, effects can be small and based on less robust evidence. The body of evidence is characterised by a considerable level of heterogeneity, unclear/overlapping populations and intervention definitions, and a low methodological quality of systematic reviews. The heterogeneity across studies is further complicated when the age (older vs. more recent), interactivity (feedback/survey vs. no/less feedback/surveys), and accessibility (type of device) of the digital intervention is considered. This underscores the difficulty in synthesising evidence in a field with rapidly evolving technology and the resulting challenges in recommending the use of digital technology in public health. There is an urgent need for further research using contemporary technology and appropriate methods."

To make interventions, aimed at improving lifestyle, fit into the daily life of survivors, interventions should be designed and delivered in a person-centred way with a limited time burden. As part of the European PanCareFollowUp project, an eHealth intervention was developed to support sustainable changes to physical activity levels and/or diet of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. This feasibility study aims to gain insight into the feasibility and potential effect sizes of the PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention. METHODS: The PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention consists of person-centred 3-6 screen-to-screen sessions with a certified lifestyle coach. The intervention will be evaluated with a single-arm pre-post feasibility study conducted at two survivorship care clinics in the Netherlands. A total of 60 participants who are (i) diagnosed with cancer <25 years, (ii) >/= 5 years post-treatment, (iii) aged 16-55 years, and (iv) have a low physical activity level and/or unhealthy dietary intake manifested by overweight will be recruited. Using reports, hospital records, and questionnaires for survivors, coaches, and late effect doctors, feasibility will be based on (i) adherence to intervention, (ii) acceptability, (iii) practicality, (iv) integration/implementation, (v) demand, and (vi) attrition. The potential effect sizes of the intervention will be explored by determining the percentage of survivors that reach the personalized lifestyle goals that were set with the coach. Physical activity level, dietary intake, BMI, general self-efficacy, self-management, and motivation level will be assessed at three time points with questionnaires, reports, and/or an accelerometer. DISCUSSION: Data of this study will be gathered to assess the feasibility and potential effect sizes. This will allow for further intervention refinement as needed as well as to inform a future large-scale intervention study and a manual for implementation at other centres.

Developing an mHealth Intervention to Reduce COVID-19-Associated Psychological Distress Among Health Care Workers in Nigeria: Protocol for a Design and Feasibility Study,"Akinsulore A, Aloba O, Oginni O, Oloniniyi I, Ibigbami O, Seun-Fadipe CT, Opakunle T, Owojuyigbe AM, Olibamoyo O, Mapayi B, Okorie VO, Adewuya AO.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Nov 16;11(11):e36174. doi: 10.2196/36174.,Akinsulore A,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/11/01,PMC9674083,,10.2196/36174,"BACKGROUND: Globally, COVID-19-related psychological distress is seriously eroding health care workers' mental health and well-being, especially in low-income countries like Nigeria. The use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions is now increasingly recognized as an innovative approach that may improve mental health and well-being. This project aims to develop an mHealth psychological intervention (mPsyI) to reduce COVID-19-related psychological distress among health care workers in Nigeria. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to present a study protocol to determine the level of COVID-19-related psychological distress among health care workers in Nigeria; explore health care workers' experience of COVID-19-related psychological distress; develop and pilot test mPsyI to reduce this distress; and assess the feasibility of this intervention (such as usability, engagement, and satisfaction). METHODS: A mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods approach is used in which health care workers will be recruited from 2 tertiary health care facilities in southwest Nigeria. The study is divided into 4 phases based on the study objectives. Phase 1 involves a quantitative survey to assess the type and levels of psychosocial distress. Phase 2 collects qualitative data on psychosocial distress among health care workers. Phase 3 involves development of the mHealth-based psychological intervention, and phase 4 is a mixed methods study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. RESULTS: This study was funded in November 2020 by the Global Effort on COVID-19 Health Research, and collection of preliminary baseline data started in July 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report the development of an mHealth-based intervention to reduce COVID-19-related psychological distress among health care workers in Nigeria. Using a mixed methods design in this study can potentially facilitate the adaptation of an evidence-based treatment method that is culturally sensitive and cost-effective for the management of COVID-19-related psychological distress among health care workers in Nigeria.

Transitions from biomedical to recovery-oriented practices in mental health: a scoping review to explore the role of Internet-based interventions,"Strand M, Gammon D, Ruland CM.",BMC Health Serv Res. 2017 Apr 7;17(1):257. doi: 10.1186/s12913-017-2176-5.,Strand M,BMC Health Serv Res,2017,2017/04/09,PMC5385090,,10.1186/s12913-017-2176-5,"BACKGROUND: The Internet is transforming mental health care services by increasing access to, and potentially improving the quality of, care. Internet-based interventions in mental health can potentially play a role in transitions from biomedical to recovery-oriented research and practices, but an overview of what this may entail, current work, and issues that need addressing, is lacking. The objective of this study is to describe Internet-based recovery-oriented interventions (referred to as e-recovery) and current research, and to identify gaps and issues relevant to advancing recovery research and practices through opportunities provided by the Internet. METHODS: Five iterative stages of a scoping review framework were followed in searching and analyzing the literature. A recovery framework with four domains and 16 themes was used to deductively code intervention characteristics according to their support for recovery-oriented practices. Only Internet-based interventions used in conjunction with ongoing care were included. RESULTS: Twenty studies describing six e-recovery interventions were identified and originated in Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and USA. The domain supporting personal recovery was most clearly reflected in interventions, whereas the last three domains, i.e., promoting citizenship, organizational commitment and working relationship were less evident. Support for the formulation and follow-up of personal goals and preferences, and in accessing peer-support, were the characteristics shared by most interventions. Three of the six studies that employed a comparison group used randomization, and none presented definitive findings. None used recovery-oriented frameworks or specific recovery outcome measures. Four of the interventions were specific to a diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Research about how technologies might aid in illuminating and shaping recovery processes is in its formative stages. We recommend that future e-recovery research and innovation attend to four dimensions: evidence-supported interventions, new knowledge about personal recovery, values-based approaches and Internet as a facilitator for organizational transformation. The incremental changes facilitated by e-recovery may help propel a shift in mental health care toward recovery-oriented practices."
Applications of Digital Health Technologies in Knee Osteoarthritis: Narrative Review,"Shah N, Costello K, Mehta A, Kumar D.",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol. 2022 Jun 8;9(2):e33489. doi: 10.2196/33489.,Shah N,JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,2022,2022/06/08,PMC9218886,,10.2196/33489,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing adoption of high-speed internet and mobile technologies by older adults, digital health is a promising modality to enhance clinical care for people with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), including those with knee replacement (KR). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize the current use, cost-effectiveness, and patient and clinician perspectives of digital health for intervention delivery in KOA and KR. METHODS: In this narrative review, search terms such as mobile health, smartphone, mobile application, mobile technology, ehealth, text message, internet, knee osteoarthritis, total knee arthroplasty, and knee replacement were used in the PubMed and Embase databases between October 2018 and February 2021. The search was limited to original articles published in the English language within the past 10 years. In total, 91 studies were included. RESULTS: Digital health technologies such as websites, mobile apps, telephone calls, SMS text messaging, social media, videoconferencing, and custom multi-technology systems have been used to deliver interventions in KOA and KR populations. Overall, there was significant heterogeneity in the types and applications of digital health used in these populations. Digital patient education improved disease-related knowledge, especially when used as an adjunct to traditional methods of patient education for both KOA and KR. Digital health that incorporated person-specific motivational messages, biofeedback, or patient monitoring was more successful at improving physical activity than self-directed digital interventions for both KOA and KR. Many digital exercise interventions were found to be as effective as in-person physical therapy for people with KOA. Many digital exercise interventions for KR incorporated both in-person and web-based treatments (blended format), communication with clinicians, and multi-technology systems and were successful in improving knee range of motion and self-reported symptoms and reducing the length of hospital stays. All digital interventions that incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy or similar psychological interventions showed significant improvements in knee pain, function, and psychological health when compared with no treatment or traditional treatments for both KOA and KR. Although limited in number, studies have indicated that digital health may be cost-effective for these populations, especially when travel costs are considered. Finally, although patients with KOA and KR and clinicians had positive views on digital health, concerns related to privacy and security and concerns related to logistics and training were raised by patients and clinicians, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For people with KOA and KR, many studies found digital health to be as effective as traditional treatments for patient education, physical activity, and exercise interventions. All digital interventions that incorporated cognitive behavioral therapy or similar psychological treatments were reported to result in significant improvements in patients with KOA and KR when compared with no treatment or traditional treatments. Overall, technologies that were blended and incorporated communication with clinicians, as well as biofeedback or patient monitoring, showed favorable outcomes."
Efficacy of mobile application interventions for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: A systematic review,"Wickersham A, Petrides PM, Williamson V, Leightley D.",Digit Health. 2019 Apr 12;5:2055207619842986. doi: 10.1177/2055207619842986. eCollection 2019 Jan-Dec.,Wickersham A,Digit Health,2019,2019/04/26,PMC6463234,,10.1177/2055207619842986,"BACKGROUND: Many adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are unable to access healthcare services for treatment due to logistical, social, and attitudinal barriers. Interventions delivered via mobile applications (apps) may help overcome these barriers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence from trials investigating the efficacy of mobile apps for treating PTSD. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and Medline were searched in February 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they quantitatively evaluated the efficacy of a mobile app for treating PTSD as part of the primary aim. Findings were presented in a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: In the five identified RCTs, the use of app-based interventions appeared to be associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms. However, the strength of evidence for this association appeared to be inconsistent, and there was little evidence that those using the apps experienced greater reductions in PTSD symptoms than those in control conditions. Nonetheless, there was some evidence that app-based interventions are both a feasible and acceptable treatment pathway option. CONCLUSIONS: Included studies were often limited by small sample sizes, brief intervention, and follow-up periods, and self-reported measures of PTSD. Evidence for the efficacy of mobile interventions for treating PTSD was inconclusive, but promising. Healthcare professionals should exercise caution in recommending app-based interventions until the potentially adverse effects of app use are better understood and larger-scale studies have taken place."
eHealth Tools Supporting Early Childhood Education and Care Centers to Assess and Enhance Nutrition and Physical Activity Environments: Protocol for a Scoping Review,"Hayek J, Elliott K, Vermette M, Lafave LM.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Oct 24;12:e52252. doi: 10.2196/52252.,Hayek J,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/10/24,PMC10630867,,10.2196/52252,"BACKGROUND: Many children today are growing up in environments that predispose them to develop noncommunicable diseases. While no single preventive solution exists, evidence supports interventions in childcare settings for establishing good nutrition and physical activity behaviors as a ""critical window"" that could reduce the risk of developing noncommunicable diseases later in life. Emerging eHealth tools have shown potential in promoting best practices for nutrition and physical activity environments in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this review is to map the breadth of available evidence on eHealth tools currently available to assess and support best practices for nutrition, physical activity, or both in ECEC settings and to highlight potential research directions. METHODS: This scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Scoping Reviews with adherence to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist guidelines. Eligibility is based on the Population, Concept, and Context criteria as follows: (1) early childhood educators (population); (2) eHealth (digital) technology, such as websites, smartphone apps, email, and social media (concept); and (3) measurement and intervention tools to support best practices for nutrition, physical activity, or both in ECEC settings (context). The information sources for this review are the bibliographic databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, ERIC, and Embase in English and French with no date restrictions. Following this, a scan of gray literature will be undertaken. The electronic search strategy was developed in collaboration with two librarians. Two independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts of all relevant publications against inclusion criteria, followed by a full-text review using a data extraction tool developed by the reviewers. A synthesis of included papers will describe the publication, assessment, and intervention tool details. A summary of the findings will describe the types of eHealth assessment tools available, psychometric properties, eHealth intervention components, and theoretical frameworks used for development. RESULTS: Preliminary searches of bibliographic databases to test and calibrate the search were carried out in May 2023. Study selection based on titles and abstracts was started in August 2023. The developed search strategy will guide our search for gray literature. The findings will be presented in visualized data map format, waffle chart, or tabular format accompanied by a narrative discussion. The scoping review is planned for completion in 2024. CONCLUSIONS: A structured review of the literature will provide a summary of the range and type of eHealth tools available for ECEC programs to assess and improve nutrition environments, physical activity environments, or both in order to identify gaps in the current evidence base and provide insights to guide future intervention research.

"Habit Strength, Medication Adherence, and Habit-Based Mobile Health Interventions Across Chronic Medical Conditions: Systematic Review","Badawy SM, Shah R, Beg U, Heneghan MB.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Apr 28;22(4):e17883. doi: 10.2196/17883.,Badawy SM,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/04/29,PMC7218590,,10.2196/17883,"BACKGROUND: Unintentional medication nonadherence is common and has been associated with poor health outcomes and increased health care costs. Earlier research demonstrated a relationship between habit strength and medication adherence. Previous research also examined a habit's direct effect on adherence and how habit interacts with more conscious factors to influence or overrule them. However, the relationship between habit and adherence and the role of habit-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence for habit strength, medication adherence, and habit-based mHealth interventions across chronic medical conditions. METHODS: A keyword search with combinations of the terms habit, habit strength, habit index, medication adherence, and medication compliance was conducted on the PubMed database. After duplicates were removed, two authors conducted independent abstract and full-text screening. The guidelines for the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) were followed when reporting evidence across the included and reviewed studies. RESULTS: Of the 687 records examined, 11 met the predefined inclusion criteria and were finalized for data extraction, grading, and synthesis. Most included studies (6/11, 55%) were cross-sectional and used a theoretical model (8/11, 73%). The majority of studies measured habit strength using the self-report habit index and self-report behavioral automaticity index (9/11, 82%). Habit strength was positively correlated with medication adherence in most studies (10/11, 91%). Habit mediated the effects of self-efficacy on medication adherence (1/11, 9%), and social norms moderated the effects of habit strength on medication adherence (1/11, 9%). Habit strength also moderated the effects of poor mental health symptoms and medication adherence (1/11, 9%). None of the included studies reported on using or proposing a habit-based mHealth behavioral intervention to promote medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Habit strength was strongly correlated with medication adherence, and stronger habit was associated with higher medication adherence rates, regardless of the theoretical model and/or guiding framework. Habit-based interventions should be used to increase medication adherence, and these interventions could leverage widely available mobile technology tools such as mobile apps or text messaging, and existing routines."

The aim of this project is to develop a mobile phone intervention for people with psychosis and to conduct a feasibility study of the TechCare App. METHODS: The TechCare App will assess participant's symptoms and respond with a personalised guided self-help-based psychological intervention with the aim of exploring feasibility and acceptability. The project will recruit 16 service users and 8-10 health professionals from the Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust Early Intervention Service. RESULTS: In strand 1 of the study, we will invite people to discuss their experience of psychosis and give their opinions on the existing evidence-based treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy) and how the mobile app can be developed. In strand 2, we will complete a test run with a small number of participants (n = 4) to refine the mobile intervention (TechCare). Finally, in strand 3 of the study, the TechCare App will be examined in a feasibility study with 12 participants. CONCLUSION: It has been suggested that there is a need for a rapid increase in the efforts to develop the evidence base for the clinical effectiveness of digital technologies, considering mHealth research can potentially be helpful in addressing the demand on mental health services globally."
Trends in Effectiveness of Organizational eHealth Interventions in Addressing Employee Mental Health: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Stratton E, Lampit A, Choi I, Malmberg Gavelin H, Aji M, Taylor J, Calvo RA, Harvey SB, Glozier N.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Sep 27;24(9):e37776. doi: 10.2196/37776.,Stratton E,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/09/27,PMC9555335,,10.2196/37776,"BACKGROUND: Mental health conditions are considered the leading cause of disability, sickness absence, and long-term work incapacity. eHealth interventions provide employees with access to psychological assistance. There has been widespread implementation and provision of eHealth interventions in the workplace as an inexpensive and anonymous way of addressing common mental disorders. OBJECTIVE: This updated review aimed to synthesize the literature on the efficacy of eHealth interventions for anxiety, depression, and stress outcomes in employee samples in organizational settings and evaluate whether their effectiveness has improved over time. METHODS: Systematic searches of relevant articles published from 2004 to July 2020 of eHealth intervention trials (app- or web-based) focusing on the mental health of employees were conducted. The quality and bias of all studies were assessed. We extracted means and SDs from publications by comparing the differences in effect sizes (Hedge g) in standardized mental health outcomes. We meta-analyzed these data using a random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified a tripling of the body of evidence, with 75 trials available for meta-analysis from a combined sample of 14,747 articles. eHealth interventions showed small positive effects for anxiety (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.39; P<.001), depression (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.34; P<.001), and stress (Hedges g=0.25, 95% CI 0.17-0.34; P<.001) in employees' after intervention, with similar effects seen at the medium-term follow-up. However, there was evidence of no increase in the effectiveness of these interventions over the past decade. CONCLUSIONS: This review and meta-analysis confirmed that eHealth interventions have a small positive impact on reducing mental health symptoms in employees. Disappointingly, we found no evidence that, despite the advances in technology and the enormous resources in time, research, and finance devoted to this area for over a decade, better interventions are being produced. Hopefully, these small effect sizes do not represent optimum outcomes in organizational settings.

"Study protocol for the description and evaluation of the ""Habit Coach"" - a longitudinal multicenter mHealth intervention for healthy habit formation in health care professionals","Vogelsang A, Hinrichs C, Fleig L, Pfeffer I.",BMC Public Health. 2022 Sep 4;22(1):1672. doi: 10.1186/s12889-022-13986-0.,Vogelsang A,BMC Public Health,2022,2022/09/04,PMC9440859,,10.1186/s12889-022-13986-0,"BACKGROUND: The adoption of a healthy lifestyle plays a crucial role for the health and well-being of health care professionals. Previous e- and mHealth interventions relied on deliberative psychological processes (e.g., intention, planning) to target lifestyle changes, while revealing mixed efficacy. The additional potential of non-deliberative, automatic processes (i.e., habits) for behavior change has been understudied in interventions so far. The Habit Coach mHealth intervention combines deliberative and non-deliberative processes to support health care professionals in forming healthy physical activity, nutrition and mindfulness habits in daily life. The aim of this paper is to outline the study protocol including a detailed description of the mHealth intervention, evaluation plan, and study design. The purpose of this trial is to understand healthy habit formation in health care professionals over time. METHODS: A one-arm, multicenter mHealth intervention study will be conducted. Behavioral and psychosocial predictors will be collected via within-app questionnaires across a 100-day period at baseline, post, as well as at weekly assessments. To understand habit formation across time, linear mixed models will be used. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to unravel the role of motivational and volitional determinants for healthy habit formation across multiple health behaviors in health care professionals embedded in a mHealth intervention.

Public Health Implications of Adapting HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Programs for Virtual Service Delivery in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Systematic Review,"Patel P, Kerzner M, Reed JB, Sullivan PS, El-Sadr WM.",JMIR Public Health Surveill. 2022 Jun 7;8(6):e37479. doi: 10.2196/37479.,Patel P,JMIR Public Health Surveill,2022,2022/04/29,PMC9177169,,10.2196/37479,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 threatens to disrupt global progress toward HIV epidemic control. Opportunities exist to leverage ongoing public health responses to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on HIV services, and novel approaches to care provision might help address both epidemics. OBJECTIVE: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, novel approaches to maintain comprehensive HIV prevention service delivery are needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the related literature to highlight adaptations that could address potential COVID-19-related service interruptions. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and searched six databases, OVID/Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase, for studies published between January 1, 2010, and October 26, 2021, related to recent technology-based interventions for virtual service delivery. Search terms included ""telemedicine,"" ""telehealth,"" ""mobile health,"" ""eHealth,"" ""mHealth,"" ""telecommunication,"" ""social media,"" ""mobile device,"" and ""internet,"" among others. Of the 6685 abstracts identified, 1259 focused on HIV virtual service delivery, 120 of which were relevant for HIV prevention efforts; 48 pertained to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and 19 of these focused on evaluations of interventions for the virtual service delivery of PrEP. Of the 16 systematic reviews identified, three were specific to PrEP. All 35 papers were reviewed for outcomes of efficacy, feasibility, and/or acceptability. Limitations included heterogeneity of the studies' methodological approaches and outcomes; thus, a meta-analysis was not performed. We considered the evidence-based interventions found in our review and developed a virtual service delivery model for HIV prevention interventions. We also considered how this platform could be leveraged for COVID-19 prevention and care. RESULTS: We summarize 19 studies of virtual service delivery of PrEP and 16 relevant reviews. Examples of technology-based interventions that were effective, feasible, and/or acceptable for PrEP service delivery include: use of SMS, internet, and smartphone apps such as iText (50% [95% CI 16%-71%] reduction in discontinuation of PrEP) and PrEPmate (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.24-5.5.4); telehealth and eHealth platforms for virtual visits such as PrEPTECH and IowaTelePrEP; and platforms for training of health care workers such as Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO). We suggest a virtual service delivery model for PrEP that can be leveraged for COVID-19 using the internet and social media for demand creation, community-based self-testing, telehealth platforms for risk assessment and follow-up, applications for support groups and adherence/appointment reminders, and applications for monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Innovations in the virtual service provision of PrEP occurred before COVID-19 but have new relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The innovations we describe might strengthen HIV prevention service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the long run by engaging traditionally hard-to-reach populations, reducing stigma, and creating a more accessible health care platform. These virtual service delivery platforms can mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV services, which can be leveraged to facilitate COVID-19 pandemic control now and for future responses."
"Effectiveness of a smart phone app on improving immunization of children in rural Sichuan Province, China: study protocol for a paired cluster randomized controlled trial","Chen L, Wang W, Du X, Rao X, van Velthoven MH, Yang R, Zhang L, Koepsell JC, Li Y, Wu Q, Zhang Y.",BMC Public Health. 2014 Mar 20;14:262. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-14-262.,Chen L,BMC Public Health,2014,2014/03/21,PMC3999920,,10.1186/1471-2458-14-262,"BACKGROUND: Although good progress has been achieved in expanding immunization of children in China, disparities exist across different provinces. Information gaps both from the service supply and demand sides hinder timely vaccination of children in rural areas. The rapid development of mobile health technology (mHealth) provides unprecedented opportunities for improving health services and reaching underserved populations. However, there is a lack of literature that rigorously evaluates the impact of mHealth interventions on immunization coverage as well as the usability and feasibility of smart phone applications (apps). This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a smart phone-based app (Expanded Program on Immunization app, or EPI app) on improving the coverage of children's immunization. METHODS/DESIGN: This cluster randomized trial will take place in Xuanhan County, Sichuan Province, China. Functionalities of the app include the following: to make appointments automatically, record and update children's immunization information, generate a list of children who missed their vaccination appointments, and send health education information to village doctors. After pairing, 36 villages will be randomly allocated to the intervention arm (n=18) and control arm (n=18). The village doctors in the intervention arm will use the app while the village doctors in the control arm will record and manage immunization in the usual way in their catchment areas. A household survey will be used at baseline and at endline (8 months of implementation). The primary outcome is full-dose coverage and the secondary outcome is immunization coverage of the five vaccines that are included in the national Expanded Program on Immunization program as well as Hib vaccine, Rotavirus vaccine and Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Multidimensional evaluation of the app will also be conducted to assess usability and feasibility. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a smart phone app for child immunization in rural China. This study will contribute to the knowledge about the usability and feasibility of a smart phone app for managing immunization in rural China and to similar populations in different settings.

Technology-Delivered Adaptations of Motivational Interviewing for the Prevention and Management of Chronic Diseases: Scoping Review,"Pedamallu H, Ehrhardt MJ, Maki J, Carcone AI, Hudson MM, Waters EA.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Aug 9;24(8):e35283. doi: 10.2196/35283.,Pedamallu H,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/08/09,PMC9399886,,10.2196/35283,"BACKGROUND: Motivational interviewing (MI) can increase health-promoting behaviors and decrease health-damaging behaviors. However, MI is often resource intensive, precluding its use with people with limited financial or time resources. Mobile health-based versions of MI interventions or technology-delivered adaptations of MI (TAMIs) might increase reach. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the characteristics of existing TAMIs. We were particularly interested in the inclusion of people from marginalized sociodemographic groups, whether the TAMI addressed sociocontextual factors, and how behavioral and health outcomes were reported. METHODS: We employed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews to conduct our scoping review. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo from January 1, 1996, to April 6, 2022, to identify studies that described interventions incorporating MI into a mobile or electronic health platform. For inclusion, the study was required to (1) describe methods/outcomes of an MI intervention, (2) feature an intervention delivered automatically via a mobile or electronic health platform, and (3) report a behavioral or health outcome. The exclusion criteria were (1) publication in a language other than English and (2) description of only in-person intervention delivery (ie, no TAMI). We charted results using Excel (Microsoft Corp). RESULTS: Thirty-four studies reported the use of TAMIs. Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 2069 participants aged 13 to 70 years. Most studies (n=27) directed interventions toward individuals engaging in behaviors that increased chronic disease risk. Most studies (n=22) oversampled individuals from marginalized sociodemographic groups, but few (n=3) were designed specifically with marginalized groups in mind. TAMIs used text messaging (n=8), web-based intervention (n=22), app + text messaging (n=1), and web-based intervention + text messaging (n=3) as delivery platforms. Of the 34 studies, 30 (88%) were randomized controlled trials reporting behavioral and health-related outcomes, 23 of which reported statistically significant improvements in targeted behaviors with TAMI use. TAMIs improved targeted health behaviors in the remaining 4 studies. Moreover, 11 (32%) studies assessed TAMI feasibility, acceptability, or satisfaction, and all rated TAMIs highly in this regard. Among 20 studies with a disproportionately high number of people from marginalized racial or ethnic groups compared with the general US population, 16 (80%) reported increased engagement in health behaviors or better health outcomes. However, no TAMIs included elements that addressed sociocontextual influences on behavior or health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that TAMIs may improve some health promotion and disease management behaviors. However, few TAMIs were designed specifically for people from marginalized sociodemographic groups, and none included elements to help address sociocontextual challenges. Research is needed to determine how TAMIs affect individual health outcomes and how to incorporate elements that address sociocontextual factors, and to identify the best practices for implementing TAMIs into clinical practice."
Factors Determining the Success and Failure of eHealth Interventions: Systematic Review of the Literature,"Granja C, Janssen W, Johansen MA.",J Med Internet Res. 2018 May 1;20(5):e10235. doi: 10.2196/10235.,Granja C,J Med Internet Res,2018,2018/05/03,PMC5954232,,10.2196/10235,"BACKGROUND: eHealth has an enormous potential to improve healthcare cost, effectiveness, and quality of care. However, there seems to be a gap between the foreseen benefits of research and clinical reality. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to systematically review the factors influencing the outcome of eHealth interventions in terms of success and failure. METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for original peer-reviewed studies on implemented eHealth tools that reported on the factors for the success or failure, or both, of the intervention. We conducted the systematic review by following the patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome framework, with 2 of the authors independently reviewing the abstract and full text of the articles. We collected data using standardized forms that reflected the categorization model used in the qualitative analysis of the outcomes reported in the included articles. RESULTS: Among the 903 identified articles, a total of 221 studies complied with the inclusion criteria. The studies were heterogeneous by country, type of eHealth intervention, method of implementation, and reporting perspectives. The article frequency analysis did not show a significant discrepancy between the number of reports on failure (392/844, 46.5%) and on success (452/844, 53.6%). The qualitative analysis identified 27 categories that represented the factors for success or failure of eHealth interventions. A quantitative analysis of the results revealed the category quality of healthcare (n=55) as the most mentioned as contributing to the success of eHealth interventions, and the category costs (n=42) as the most mentioned as contributing to failure. For the category with the highest unique article frequency, workflow (n=51), we conducted a full-text review. The analysis of the 23 articles that met the inclusion criteria identified 6 barriers related to workflow: workload (n=12), role definition (n=7), undermining of face-to-face communication (n=6), workflow disruption (n=6), alignment with clinical processes (n=2), and staff turnover (n=1). CONCLUSIONS: The reviewed literature suggested that, to increase the likelihood of success of eHealth interventions, future research must ensure a positive impact in the quality of care, with particular attention given to improved diagnosis, clinical management, and patient-centered care. There is a critical need to perform in-depth studies of the workflow(s) that the intervention will support and to perceive the clinical processes involved."
Leveraging mHealth and Wearable Sensors to Manage Alcohol Use Disorders: A Systematic Literature Review,"Kruse CS, Betancourt JA, Madrid S, Lindsey CW, Wall V.",Healthcare (Basel). 2022 Sep 1;10(9):1672. doi: 10.3390/healthcare10091672.,Kruse CS,Healthcare (Basel),2022,2022/09/23,PMC9498895,,10.3390/healthcare10091672,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a condition prevalent in many countries around the world, and the public burden of its treatment is close to $130 billion. mHealth offers several possible interventions to assist in the treatment of AUD. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the effectiveness of mHealth and wearable sensors to manage AUD from evidence published over the last 10 years. METHODS: Following the Kruse Protocol and PRISMA 2020, four databases were queried (PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Science Direct) to identify studies with strong methodologies (n = 25). RESULTS: Five interventions were identified, and 20/25 were effective at reducing alcohol consumption. Other interventions reported a decrease in depression and an increase in medication compliance. Primary barriers to the adoption of mHealth interventions are a requirement to train users, some are equally as effective as the traditional means of treatment, cost, and computer literacy. CONCLUSION: While not all mHealth interventions demonstrated statistically significant reduction in alcohol consumption, most are still clinically effective to treat AUD and provide a patient with their preference of a technologically inclined treatment Most interventions require training of users and some technology literacy, the barriers identified were very few compared with the litany of positive results."
eHealth intervention to manage symptoms for patients with cancer on immunotherapy (SOFIA): a study protocol for a randomised controlled external pilot trial,"Sauer C, Krauß J, Jäger D, Zschäbitz S, Haag GM, Walle T, Sauer S, Kiermeier S, Friederich HC, Maatouk I.",BMJ Open. 2021 Jul 19;11(7):e047277. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047277.,Sauer C,BMJ Open,2021,2021/07/20,PMC8291315,,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047277,"INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) is associated with a distinct pattern of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by inadvertently redirecting immune responses to healthy tissues. IrAEs can occur at any time; however, in most cases, they arise during the first 14 weeks of the beginning of immune checkpoint blockade. In many cases, immunotherapy must be discontinued due to irAEs. Early detection of irAEs triggers the temporary withholding of ICT or initiation of short-term immunosuppressive treatment, is crucial in preventing further aggravation of irAEs and enables safe re-exposure to ICT. This prospective study aims to evaluate the feasibility of an eHealth intervention for patients under immunotherapy (managing symptoms of immunotherapy, SOFIA). The SOFIA-App consists of two components: SOFIA-Monitoring, a tool to rate patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including irAEs, and SOFIA-Coaching, which provides important information about cancer-specific and immunotherapy-specific topics and the counselling services of the National Centre for Tumour Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We outlined a patient-level two-arm randomised controlled pilot trial of the intervention (SOFIA) versus no-SOFIA for patients with cancer beginning an immunotherapy, aged >/=18 years, recruited from the NCT, Heidelberg. Feasibility outcomes include: recruitment rate; drop-out rate; reasons for refusal and drop-out; willingness to be randomised, utilisation rate of SOFIA-Monitoring and utilisation time of SOFIA-Coaching, physicians utilisation rate of the PROs; feasibility of the proposed outcome measures and optimal sample size estimation. The clinical outcomes are measures of quality of life, psychosocial symptoms, self-efficacy, physician-patient communication and medical process data, which are assessed at the beginning of the intervention, postintervention and at 6-month follow-up. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Heidelberg University, Germany (Reference, S-581/2018). TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: We registered the study in the German Clinical Trial Register (Reference: DRKS00021064). Findings will be disseminated broadly via peer-reviewed empirical journals, articles and conference presentations."
Improving Blood Pressure Among African Americans With Hypertension Using a Mobile Health Approach (the MI-BP App): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Buis LR, Dawood K, Kadri R, Dawood R, Richardson CR, Djuric Z, Sen A, Plegue M, Hutton D, Brody A, McNaughton CD, Brook RD, Levy P.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Jan 25;8(1):e12601. doi: 10.2196/12601.,Buis LR,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/01/26,PMC6367671,,10.2196/12601,"BACKGROUND: African Americans shoulder significant disparities related to hypertension (HTN), which is a serious public health problem in the city of Detroit, Michigan, where more than 80% of the population is African American. Connectivity through smartphones, use of home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, and newly developed mobile health (mHealth) interventions can facilitate behavioral changes and may improve long-term self-care for chronic conditions, but implementation of a combined approach utilizing these methods has not been tested among African American patients with uncontrolled HTN. Since African Americans are more likely than other racial or ethnic subgroups to utilize the emergency department (ED) for ambulatory care, this presents an opportunity to intervene on a population that is otherwise difficult to reach. OBJECTIVE: The MI-BP app aims to reduce health disparities related to HTN in the community by employing a user-centered intervention focused on self-BP monitoring, physical activity, reduced sodium intake, and medication adherence. We seek to test the efficacy of MI-BP, an mHealth app for HTN self-management, on BP control (primary aim), physical activity, sodium intake, and medication adherence (secondary aim) in African Americans with HTN. This study also seeks to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MI-BP when compared with usual care methods. METHODS: This is a 1-year randomized controlled trial that will recruit individuals who have uncontrolled HTN from 2 EDs in the city of Detroit, with a planned sample size of 396 randomized participants. To be eligible for inclusion, potential participants must be African American, 25 to 70 years old, previously diagnosed with HTN, have a smartphone compatible with MI-BP, and have uncontrolled BP at triage and on repeat measurement at least 1-hour post triage vitals. Once a participant is deemed eligible, all study procedures and subsequent follow-up visits (8 in total) are conducted at the Wayne State University Clinical Research Service Center. We seek to determine the effect of MI-BP on BP for 1 year (using BP control and mean systolic BP as coprimary outcomes and physical activity, sodium intake, and medication adherence as secondary outcomes) compared with usual care controls. RESULTS: Recruitment for this study began in January 2018. The study will continue through 2021. CONCLUSIONS: As the first of its kind conducted in an ED setting, MI-BP was designed to document the efficacy and acceptability of a multicomponent mHealth approach to help African Americans with uncontrolled BP modify their lifestyle to better manage their HTN. We expect to lay the foundation to sustainably reduce HTN-related health disparities through better integration of multiple behavior self-monitoring and improve outcomes for those who traditionally rely on the ED for chronic disease care.

Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been proven to increase exercise, but engagement often fades with time. As the use of health behavior theory in mHealth design can increase effectiveness, we developed StepAdd, an mHealth intervention based on the constructs of social cognitive theory (SCT). StepAdd improves exercise behavior self-efficacy and self-regulation through the use of goal-setting, barrier-identifying, and barrier-coping strategies, as well as automatic feedback functions. A single-arm pilot study of StepAdd among 33 patients with T2D showed a large increase in step count (mean change of 4714, SD 3638 daily steps or +86.7%), along with strong improvements in BMI (mean change of -0.3 kg/m(2)) and hemoglobin A(1c) level (mean change of -0.79 percentage points). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of StepAdd, an mHealth exercise support system for patients with T2D, via a large, long, and controlled follow-up to the pilot study. METHODS: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study targeting 160 patients with T2D from 5 institutions in Japan with a 24-week intervention. The intervention group will record daily step counts, body weight, and blood pressure using the SCT-based mobile app, StepAdd, and receive feedback about these measurements. In addition, they will set weekly step count goals, identify personal barriers to walking, and define strategies to overcome these barriers. The control group will record daily step counts, body weight, and blood pressure using a non-SCT-based placebo app. Both groups will receive monthly consultations with a physician who will advise patients regarding lifestyle modifications and use of the app. The 24-week intervention period will be followed by a 12-week observational period to investigate the sustainability of the intervention's effects. The primary outcome is between-group difference in the change in hemoglobin A(1c) values at 24 weeks. The secondary outcomes include other health measures, measurements of steps, measurements of other behavior changes, and assessments of app use. The trial began in January 2023 and is intended to be completed in December 2025. RESULTS: As of September 5, 2023, we had recruited 44 patients. We expect the trial to be completed by October 8, 2025, with the follow-up observation period being completed by December 31, 2025. CONCLUSIONS: This trial will provide important evidence about the efficacy of an SCT-based mHealth intervention in improving physical activities and glycemic control in patients with T2D. If this study proves the intervention to be effective and safe, it could be a key step toward the integration of mHealth as part of the standard treatment received by patients with T2D in Japan.

A Mobile Intervention to Promote Low-Risk Drinking Habits in Young Adults: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Boumparis N, Schulte MH, Kleiboer A, Huizink A, Riper H.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Jun 7;10(6):e29750. doi: 10.2196/29750.,Boumparis N,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/05/25,PMC8223804,,10.2196/29750,"BACKGROUND: Young adults' drinking habits commonly exceed recommendations for low-risk drinking, which may have a negative effect on their mental, social, and physical health. As smartphones are highly accessible to young adults, mobile apps could be used to support young adults to develop low-risk drinking habits and improve their general health. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Boozebuster, a self-guided mobile app based on healthy lifestyle-related components that aim to develop and maintain low-risk drinking habits among young adults. METHODS: This two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will investigate whether a 6-week self-guided mobile intervention (Boozebuster) targeting drinking behavior is more effective than a minimal intervention consisting of an educational website on alcohol use and its consequences for young adults. We will recruit 506 young adults (aged 18-30 years) from the Netherlands via an open recruitment strategy by using an open access website. All outcomes will be self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10 g ethanol per standard drink) per month (timeline follow-back [TLFB]). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale), readiness to change (Readiness to Change Questionnaire), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), trauma and COVID-19-related trauma (Short-Form Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), impulsivity (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale), study or work performance (Individual Work Performance Questionnaire), and treatment adherence. Baseline (T0), 6-week postbaseline (T1), and 3-month postbaseline (T2) assessments will be conducted and analyzed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle using multilevel mixed modeling analyses. RESULTS: Recruitment began in September 2020. We received 933 registrations via our study information website; 506 participants have completed the T0 assessment, 336 participants have completed the T1 assessment, and 308 participants have completed the T2 assessment as of May 2021. The study is still in progress, and results will be reported in 2021 and 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided mobile interventions based on a lifestyle approach might be an attractive approach for young adults due to their preference on self-reliance, healthy living, and increased perceived anonymity. Such interventions are yet understudied, and it is known that interventions addressing solely problem drinking are less appealing to young adults. We hypothesize that the Boozebuster mobile app will effectively reduce drinking levels compared to an alcohol educational website (control condition). If effective, our intervention could be an inexpensive and scalable public health intervention to improve drinking habits in young adults.

Users' Acceptability and Perceived Efficacy of mHealth for Opioid Use Disorder: Scoping Review,"Lyzwinski LN, Elgendi M, Menon C.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2024 Apr 11;12:e49751. doi: 10.2196/49751.,Lyzwinski LN,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2024,2024/04/11,PMC11046395,,10.2196/49751,"BACKGROUND: The opioid crisis continues to pose significant challenges to global public health, necessitating the development of novel interventions to support individuals in managing their substance use and preventing overdose-related deaths. Mobile health (mHealth), as a promising platform for addressing opioid use disorder, requires a comprehensive understanding of user perspectives to minimize barriers to care and optimize the benefits of mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize qualitative insights into opioid users' acceptability and perceived efficacy of mHealth and wearable technologies for opioid use disorder. METHODS: A scoping review of PubMed (MEDLINE) and Google Scholar databases was conducted to identify research on opioid user perspectives concerning mHealth-assisted interventions, including wearable sensors, SMS text messaging, and app-based technology. RESULTS: Overall, users demonstrate a high willingness to engage with mHealth interventions to prevent overdose-related deaths and manage opioid use. Users perceive mHealth as an opportunity to access care and desire the involvement of trusted health care professionals in these technologies. User comfort with wearing opioid sensors emerged as a significant factor. Personally tailored content, social support, and encouragement are preferred by users. Privacy concerns and limited access to technology pose barriers to care. CONCLUSIONS: To maximize benefits and minimize risks for users, it is crucial to implement robust privacy measures, provide comprehensive user training, integrate behavior change techniques, offer professional and peer support, deliver tailored messages, incorporate behavior change theories, assess readiness for change, design stigma-reducing apps, use visual elements, and conduct user-focused research for effective opioid management in mHealth interventions. mHealth demonstrates considerable potential as a tool for addressing opioid use disorder and preventing overdose-related deaths, given the high acceptability and perceived benefits reported by users."
Telemedicine for Adults With Cochlear Implants in the United Kingdom (CHOICE): Protocol for a Prospective Interventional Multisite Study,"Cullington H, Kitterick P, Darnton P, Finch T, Greenwell K, Riggs C, Weal M, Walker DM, Sibley A.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Apr 13;11(4):e27207. doi: 10.2196/27207.,Cullington H,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/04/13,PMC9047741,,10.2196/27207,"BACKGROUND: Cochlear implants provide hearing to approximately 750,000 people with deafness worldwide; these patients require lifelong follow-up. Care for adults with implants in the United Kingdom occurs at one of 19 centers, which may be far from the patients' homes. In a previous randomized controlled trial, we successfully introduced person-centered care. We designed, implemented, and evaluated the following remote care pathway: a personalized web-based support tool, home hearing check, self-device adjustment, and upgrading of sound processors at home rather than in the clinic. The remote care group had a significant increase in empowerment after using the tools, and the patients and clinicians were keen to continue. We would now like to scale up these improvements as an option for >12,000 UK adults using implants; we are commissioning an independent evaluation of this intervention and rollout to establish if it achieves its aims of more empowered and confident patients; more accessible and equitable care; stable hearing; more efficient, person-centered, and scalable service; and more satisfied and engaged patients and clinicians. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact and rollout of a person-centered clinical care pathway via telemedicine for adults with cochlear implants in the United Kingdom, using both outcomes and process evaluation. METHODS: This project will scale up and evaluate a person-centered long-term follow-up pathway for adults using cochlear implants through a personalized website, including a home hearing check, uploading photos of cochlear implant site, listening in noise and music practice, ordering of spares, questionnaires, and other resources. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses will be conducted, and they will be both an outcome and process evaluation. RESULTS: As of July 2021, the trial is closed, and all data collection is complete. The evaluation report is expected to be published in December 2021, and the research data have not yet been analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: This project will present the results of the first scaling up of a remote care pathway for adults with cochlear implants in the United Kingdom.

Technologies in Home-Based Digital Rehabilitation: Scoping Review,"Arntz A, Weber F, Handgraaf M, Lällä K, Korniloff K, Murtonen KP, Chichaeva J, Kidritsch A, Heller M, Sakellari E, Athanasopoulou C, Lagiou A, Tzonichaki I, Salinas-Bueno I, Martínez-Bueso P, Velasco-Roldán O, Schulz RJ, Grüneberg C.",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol. 2023 Jul 27;10:e43615. doi: 10.2196/43615.,Arntz A,JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,2023,2023/05/30,PMC10415951,,10.2196/43615,"BACKGROUND: Due to growing pressure on the health care system, a shift in rehabilitation to home settings is essential. However, efficient support for home-based rehabilitation is lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these challenges and has affected individuals and health care professionals during rehabilitation. Digital rehabilitation (DR) could support home-based rehabilitation. To develop and implement DR solutions that meet clients' needs and ease the growing pressure on the health care system, it is necessary to provide an overview of existing, relevant, and future solutions shaping the constantly evolving market of technologies for home-based DR. OBJECTIVE: In this scoping review, we aimed to identify digital technologies for home-based DR, predict new or emerging DR trends, and report on the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on DR. METHODS: The scoping review followed the framework of Arksey and O'Malley, with improvements made by Levac et al. A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. The search spanned January 2015 to January 2022. A bibliometric analysis was performed to provide an overview of the included references, and a co-occurrence analysis identified the technologies for home-based DR. A full-text analysis of all included reviews filtered the trends for home-based DR. A gray literature search supplemented the results of the review analysis and revealed the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the development of DR. RESULTS: A total of 2437 records were included in the bibliometric analysis and 95 in the full-text analysis, and 40 records were included as a result of the gray literature search. Sensors, robotic devices, gamification, virtual and augmented reality, and digital and mobile apps are already used in home-based DR; however, artificial intelligence and machine learning, exoskeletons, and digital and mobile apps represent new and emerging trends. Advantages and disadvantages were displayed for all technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased use of digital technologies as remote approaches but has not led to the development of new technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple tools are available and implemented for home-based DR; however, some technologies face limitations in the application of home-based rehabilitation. However, artificial intelligence and machine learning could be instrumental in redesigning rehabilitation and addressing future challenges of the health care system, and the rehabilitation sector in particular. The results show the need for feasible and effective approaches to implement DR that meet clients' needs and adhere to framework conditions, regardless of exceptional situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
Efficacy of mHealth and education-led peer counseling for patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease in Pakistan: study protocol for a double-blinded pragmatic randomized-controlled trial with factorial design,"Arshed M, Zakar R, Umer MF, Kiran M, Ullah N, Iftikhar G, Fischer F.",Trials. 2023 Jul 10;24(1):448. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07472-0.,Arshed M,Trials,2023,2023/07/09,PMC10331967,,10.1186/s13063-023-07472-0,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a highly relevant public health challenge. Digital interventions may support improving adherence to anti-hypertensive medications and alter health behavior. Therefore, this protocol describes a study that aims to assess the effectiveness of mHealth and educational support through peer counseling (Ed-counselling) to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients when compared to standard care. METHODS: We chose a double-blinded pragmatic randomized-controlled with factorial design for this investigation. The trial is going to recruit 1648 hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease at the age of 21 to 70 years. All participants will already be on anti-hypertensive medication and own a smartphone. They will be randomized into four groups with each having 412 participants. The first group will only receive standard care; while the second group, in addition to standard care, will receive monthly Ed-counselling (educational booklets with animated infographics and peer counseling); the third group will receive daily written and voice reminders and an education-led video once weekly together with standard care; while the fourth one gets both interventions given to second and third groups respectively. All groups will be followed-up for 1 year (0, 6, and 12 months). The primary outcome will be the change in systolic blood pressure while secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life and changes in medication adherence. For measuring changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and adherence scores difference at 0, 6, and 12 months between and within the group, parametric (ANOVA/repeated measure ANOVA) and non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis test/Friedman test) will be used. By using the general estimating equation (GEE) with negative binomial regression, at 12 months, the covariates affecting primary and secondary outcomes will be determined and controlled. The analysis will be intention-to-treat. All the outcomes will be analyzed at 0, 6, and 12 months; however, the final analysis will be at 12 months from baseline. DISCUSSION: Besides adding up to existing evidence in the literature on the subject, our designed modules using mHealth technology can help in reducing hypertension-related morbidity and mortality in developing countries."
Do digital health interventions hold promise for stroke prevention and care in Black and Latinx populations in the United States? A scoping review,"Rivera BD, Nurse C, Shah V, Roldan C, Jumbo AE, Faysel M, Levine SR, Kaufman D, Afable A.",BMC Public Health. 2023 Dec 21;23(1):2549. doi: 10.1186/s12889-023-17255-6.,Rivera BD,BMC Public Health,2023,2023/12/22,PMC10734160,,10.1186/s12889-023-17255-6,"BACKGROUND: Black and Latinx populations are disproportionately affected by stroke and are likely to experience gaps in health care. Within fragmented care systems, remote digital solutions hold promise in reversing this pattern. However, there is a digital divide that follows historical disparities in health. Without deliberate attempts to address this digital divide, rapid advances in digital health will only perpetuate systemic biases. This study aimed to characterize the range of digital health interventions for stroke care, summarize their efficacy, and examine the inclusion of Black and Latinx populations in the evidence base. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Web of Science, and EMBASE for publications between 2015 and 2021. Inclusion criteria include peer-reviewed systematic reviews or meta-analyses of experimental studies focusing on the impact of digital health interventions on stroke risk factors and outcomes in adults. Detailed information was extracted on intervention modality and functionality, clinical/behavioral outcome, study location, sample demographics, and intervention results. RESULTS: Thirty-eight systematic reviews met inclusion criteria and yielded 519 individual studies. We identified six functional categories and eight digital health modalities. Case management (63%) and health monitoring (50%) were the most common intervention functionalities. Mobile apps and web-based interventions were the two most commonly studied modalities. Evidence of efficacy was strongest for web-based, text-messaging, and phone-based approaches. Although mobile applications have been widely studied, the evidence on efficacy is mixed. Blood pressure and medication adherence were the most commonly studied outcomes. However, evidence on the efficacy of the various intervention modalities on these outcomes was variable. Among all individual studies, only 38.0% were conducted in the United States (n = 197). Of these U.S. studies, 54.8% adequately reported racial or ethnic group distribution. On average, samples were 27.0% Black, 17.1% Latinx, and 63.4% White. CONCLUSION: While evidence of the efficacy of selected digital health interventions, particularly those designed to improve blood pressure management and medication adherence, show promise, evidence of how these interventions can be generalized to historically underrepresented groups is insufficient. Including these underrepresented populations in both digital health experimental and feasibility studies is critical to advancing digital health science and achieving health equity."
Effect of Mobile Health Applications on Improving Self-Management Knowledge and Seizure Control in Epilepsy Patients: A Scoping Review,"Ernawati I, Yasin NM, Setyopranoto I, Ikawati Z.",Healthc Inform Res. 2024 Apr;30(2):127-139. doi: 10.4258/hir.2024.30.2.127. Epub 2024 Apr 30.,Ernawati I,Healthc Inform Res,2024,2024/05/16,PMC11098771,,10.4258/hir.2024.30.2.127,"OBJECTIVES: Mobile health app-based interventions are increasingly being developed to support chronic disease management, particularly for epilepsy patients. These interventions focus on managing stress, monitoring drug side effects, providing education, and promoting adherence to medication regimens. Therefore, this scoping review aims to assess how mobile health applications improve epilepsy patients' knowledge and seizure control, and to identify the features of these apps that are frequently used and have proven to be beneficial. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted using scientific databases such as ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar, adhering to the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. The review framework consisted of five steps: identifying research questions, finding relevant articles, selecting articles, presenting data, and compiling the results. The literature search included all original articles published in English from 2013 to 2023. RESULTS: Among six articles that discussed mobile applications for epilepsy patients, all featured similar functionalities, including education on epilepsy management and seizure monitoring. Four of the articles highlighted behavioral interventions, such as reminder systems, designed to improve medication adherence. The remaining two articles focused on a side-effect reporting system that enabled doctors or health workers to evaluate and regularly monitor adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review reveals that mobile health applications employing a combination of educational and behavioral interventions for epilepsy patients significantly improve knowledge about patient self-management and medication adherence. These interventions can prevent seizures, increase awareness, enable better activity planning, improve safety, and reduce the frequency of seizures and side effects of antiepileptic drugs."
Strengths-Based Behavioral Intervention for Parents of Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Using an mHealth App (Type 1 Doing Well): Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Hilliard ME, Eshtehardi SS, Minard CG, Saber R, Thompson D, Karaviti LP, Rojas Y, Anderson BJ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2018 Mar 13;7(3):e77. doi: 10.2196/resprot.9147.,Hilliard ME,JMIR Res Protoc,2018,2018/03/15,PMC5871739,,10.2196/resprot.9147,"BACKGROUND: Supportive parent involvement for adolescents' type 1 diabetes (T1D) self-management promotes optimal diabetes outcomes. However, family conflict is common and can interfere with collaborative family teamwork. Few interventions have used explicitly strengths-based approaches to help reinforce desired management behaviors and promote positive family interactions around diabetes care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this protocol was to describe the development of a new, strengths-based behavioral intervention for parents of adolescents with T1D delivered via a mobile-friendly Web app called Type 1 Doing Well. METHODS: Ten adolescent-parent dyads and 5 diabetes care providers participated in a series of qualitative interviews to inform the design of the app. The 3- to 4-month pilot intervention will involve 82 parents receiving daily prompts to use the app, in which they will mark the diabetes-related strength behaviors (ie, positive attitudes or behaviors related to living with or managing T1D) their teen engaged in that day. Parents will also receive training on how to observe diabetes strengths and how to offer teen-friendly praise via the app. Each week, the app will generate a summary of the teen's most frequent strengths from the previous week based on parent reports, and parents will be encouraged to praise their teen either in person or from a library of reinforcing text messages (short message service, SMS). RESULTS: The major outcomes of this pilot study will include intervention feasibility and satisfaction data. Clinical and behavioral outcomes will include glycemic control, regimen adherence, family relationships and conflict, diabetes burden, and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This strengths-based, mobile health (mHealth) intervention aims to help parents increase their awareness of and efforts to support their adolescents' engagement in positive diabetes-related behaviors. If efficacious, this intervention has the potential to reduce the risk of family conflict, enhance collaborative family teamwork, and ultimately improve diabetes outcomes.

Wearable and Mobile Technologies for the Evaluation and Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Scoping Review,"Frank AC, Li R, Peterson BS, Narayanan SS.",JMIR Ment Health. 2023 Jul 18;10:e45572. doi: 10.2196/45572.,Frank AC,JMIR Ment Health,2023,2023/07/18,PMC10394606,,10.2196/45572,"BACKGROUND: Smartphones and wearable biosensors can continuously and passively measure aspects of behavior and physiology while also collecting data that require user input. These devices can potentially be used to monitor symptom burden; estimate diagnosis and risk for relapse; predict treatment response; and deliver digital interventions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a prevalent and disabling psychiatric condition that often follows a chronic and fluctuating course and may uniquely benefit from these technologies. OBJECTIVE: Given the speed at which mobile and wearable technologies are being developed and implemented in clinical settings, a continual reappraisal of this field is needed. In this scoping review, we map the literature on the use of wearable devices and smartphone-based devices or apps in the assessment, monitoring, or treatment of OCD. METHODS: In July 2022 and April 2023, we conducted an initial search and an updated search, respectively, of multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO, and Web of Science, with no restriction on publication period, using the following search strategy: (""OCD"" OR ""obsessive"" OR ""obsessive-compulsive"") AND (""smartphone"" OR ""phone"" OR ""wearable"" OR ""sensing"" OR ""biofeedback"" OR ""neurofeedback"" OR ""neuro feedback"" OR ""digital"" OR ""phenotyping"" OR ""mobile"" OR ""heart rate variability"" OR ""actigraphy"" OR ""actimetry"" OR ""biosignals"" OR ""biomarker"" OR ""signals"" OR ""mobile health""). RESULTS: We analyzed 2748 articles, reviewed the full text of 77 articles, and extracted data from the 25 articles included in this review. We divided our review into the following three parts: studies without digital or mobile intervention and with passive data collection, studies without digital or mobile intervention and with active or mixed data collection, and studies with a digital or mobile intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Use of mobile and wearable technologies for OCD has developed primarily in the past 15 years, with an increasing pace of related publications. Passive measures from actigraphy generally match subjective reports. Ecological momentary assessment is well tolerated for the naturalistic assessment of symptoms, may capture novel OCD symptoms, and may also document lower symptom burden than retrospective recall. Digital or mobile treatments are diverse; however, they generally provide some improvement in OCD symptom burden. Finally, ongoing work is needed for a safe and trusted uptake of technology by patients and providers."

The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of ""INTERCEPT"", a co-designed DHI developed to improve secondary prevention in hospitalised coronary heart disease patients (CHD). Methods: This non-randomised feasibility study will be conducted using a mixed methods process evaluation with a sample of 40 patients in an acute hospital setting. Informed by behaviour change theory, the Intercept application (I-App) integrates a smartphone interface, health care professional portal, a fitness wearable and a blood pressure monitor. I-App is designed to support and motivate patients to set goals, self-monitor lifestyle and medical risk factors, and manage their medications, with the health care professional portal enabling monitoring and communication with patients. Using convenience sampling, eligible patients will be recruited in two phases, a pre-implementation phase and an implementation phase. During the pre-implementation phase participants will not immediately receive the I-App but will be invited to receive the I-App at 3 months follow-up. This will enable early learning about the processes of recruitment and conducting the assessment prior to full scale deployment of the I-App. During the implementation phase, participants will be invited to download the I-App to their smartphone prior to hospital discharge. Qualitative interviews will be conducted among a subset of patients and health care professionals to gain a greater insight into their experience of using the I-App. Primary outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Using pre-defined feasibility criteria, including recruitment, retention and engagement rates, together with data on intervention acceptability, will determine the appropriateness of progressing to a definitive trial. Discussion: This study will provide important insights to help inform the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial of ""INTERCEPT"" among coronary heart disease patients in a critical health care setting."

Pharmacological and surgical interventions are primary modes of treatment. Cognitive/behavioural management approaches and interventional pain management strategies are approaches that have been used to assist with the management of chronic pain. Accurate data collection and reporting treatment outcomes are vital to addressing the challenges faced. In light of this, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the current digital application landscape within chronic pain medicine. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to consider the prevalence of digital application usage for chronic pain management. These digital applications included mobile apps, web apps, and chatbots. DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches on PubMed and ScienceDirect for studies that were published between 1st January 1990 and 1st January 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Our review included studies that involved the use of digital applications for chronic pain conditions. There were no restrictions on the country in which the study was conducted. Only studies that were peer-reviewed and published in English were included. Four reviewers had assessed the eligibility of each study against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Out of the 84 studies that were initially identified, 38 were included in the systematic review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The AMSTAR guidelines were used to assess data quality. This assessment was carried out by 3 reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Before data collection began, the primary outcome was to report on the standard mean difference of digital application usage for chronic pain conditions. We also recorded the type of digital application studied (e.g., mobile application, web application) and, where the data was available, the standard mean difference of pain intensity, pain inferences, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. RESULTS: 38 studies were included in the systematic review and 22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The digital interventions were categorised to web and mobile applications and chatbots, with pooled standard mean difference of 0.22 (95% CI: -0.16, 0.60), 0.30 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.60) and -0.02 (95% CI: -0.47, 0.42) respectively. Pooled standard mean differences for symptomatologies of pain intensity, depression, and anxiety symptoms were 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.46), 0.30 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.43) and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.69), respectively. A sub-group analysis was conducted on pain intensity due to the heterogeneity of the results (I (2) = 82.86%; p = 0.02). After stratifying by country, we found that digital applications were more likely to be effective in some countries (e.g., United States, China) than others (e.g., Ireland, Norway). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of digital applications in improving pain-related symptoms shows promise, but further clinical studies would be needed to develop more robust applications.

We identified eligible studies by searching electronic databases using Boolean methods. The reviewed studies (N = 12) indicated that that a wide range of Internet-based, text messaging, and smartphone application interventions have been developed to address substance use. Interventions had an assortment of features; participants in each study highlighted the ease and convenience of the interventions; and the majority of studies provided support for the efficacy of mHealth in reducing substance use. Mobile technology is a promising tool for reducing substance use and warrants further development. Future practice including the use of mHealth interventions can be an integral part of reducing substance use."

Physical activity levels tend to decline steeply among children aged between 8 and 12 years, even though children's behavioral patterns are largely governed by familial structures. Similarly, parents' activity levels have been generally reported as lower than those of nonparents of comparable age. For this reason, family-based physical activity promotion interventions are a potentially valuable and relatively underresearched method for mitigating physical activity declines as children develop into adolescents and for increasing physical activity in parents. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a novel theory-based web-based physical activity promotion intervention among parent-child dyads in Finland who do not meet physical activity recommendations at baseline. METHODS: Participants (target N=254) will be recruited from the general population using a panel company and advertisements on social media and randomly assigned to either an immediate intervention group or a waitlist control group. The intervention consists of 4 web-based group workshops over the course of 10 weeks, web-based tasks and resources, and a social support chat group. Data on physical activity behavior and constructs from the integrated behavior change model will be collected through self-report surveys assessing physical activity, autonomy support, autonomous motivation, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, intention, self-monitoring, habit, and accelerometer measurements at baseline, post intervention, and 3 months post intervention. Exit interviews with participants will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention procedures. RESULTS: This study will reveal whether the intervention changes leisure-time physical activity among intervention participants relative to the control group and will examine the intervention's effects on important theoretical predictors of physical activity. It will also yield data that can be used to refine intervention materials and inform further implementation. Trial recruitment commenced in September 2023, and data collection should be completed by December 2024. CONCLUSIONS: The planned intervention has potential implications for both theory and practice. Practically, the use of an entirely web-based intervention may have scalable future uses for improving physical activity in 2 key populations, while also potentially informing on the value of dyadic, family-based strategies for encouraging an active lifestyle as an alternative to strategies that target either parents or children independently. Further, by assessing change in psychological constructs alongside potential change in behavior, the intervention also allows for important tests of theory regarding which constructs are most linked to favorable behavior change outcomes.

mHealth Intervention Applications for Adults Living With the Effects of Stroke: A Scoping Review,"Burns SP, Terblanche M, Perea J, Lillard H, DeLaPena C, Grinage N, MacKinen A, Cox EE.",Arch Rehabil Res Clin Transl. 2020 Dec 16;3(1):100095. doi: 10.1016/j.arrct.2020.100095. eCollection 2021 Mar.,Burns SP,Arch Rehabil Res Clin Transl,2020,2021/03/29,PMC7984984,,10.1016/j.arrct.2020.100095,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a scoping review of mobile health (mHealth) application (app) interventions to support needs of adults living with the effects of stroke reported in the literature. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus were systematically searched for peer-reviewed publications. Articles were published between January 2007 and September 2020 and met predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. STUDY SELECTION: Articles included were written in English language, involved adults older than 18 years, and described an mHealth app specifically tested and/or developed as an intervention for someone with stroke to be used remotely and/or independently without constant provider supervision or assistance. Articles were excluded if they focused on acute management of stroke only, focused on primary prevention, were animal studies, were not an app for smartphone or tablet, and did not describe an empirical study. DATA EXTRACTION: Two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion. The full-text articles were then reviewed for eligibility by the research team. Data were extracted and verified by a third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: The search yielded 2123 studies and 49 were included for data extraction. The findings reveal that a global surge of studies on mHealth apps for people with stroke have emerged within the past 2 years. Most studies were developed for persons with stroke in the United States and the primary content foci included upper extremity function (31.5%); lower extremity function (5.3%); general exercise, physical activity, and/or functional mobility (23.7%); trunk control (5.3%); medical management and secondary prevention (26.3%); language and speech skills (20.5%); cognitive skills (7.9%); general disability and activities of daily living (5.3%); and home safety (2.6%). Of the included studies, a majority were preliminary in nature, with 36.7% being categorized as pilot or feasibility trials and 24.4% discussing initial design, development, and/or refinement. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study reveal that the number of apps specifically developed for people with stroke and described in the scientific literature are growing exponentially. The apps have widely varied content to meet the needs of persons with stroke; however, the studies are generally preliminary in nature, focusing on development, usability, and initial pilot testing. This review highlights the need for additional research and development of mHealth apps targeted for adults with stroke. Development should consider the various and complex needs of people living with the effects of chronic stroke, while large-scale trials are needed to build on the existing evidence."
eHealth or e-Chaos: The use of Digital Health Interventions for Health Systems Strengthening in sub-Saharan Africa over the last 10 years: A scoping review,"Karamagi HC, Muneene D, Droti B, Jepchumba V, Okeibunor JC, Nabyonga J, Asamani JA, Traore M, Kipruto H.",J Glob Health. 2022 Dec 3;12:04090. doi: 10.7189/jogh.12.04090.,Karamagi HC,J Glob Health,2022,2022/12/03,PMC9718445,,10.7189/jogh.12.04090,"BACKGROUND: Digital health solutions are a potent and complementary intervention in health system strengthening to accelerate universal access to health services. Implementing scalable, sustainable, and integrated digital solutions in a coordinated manner is necessary to experience the benefits of digital interventions in health systems. We sought to establish the breadth and scope of available digital health interventions (DHIs) and their functions in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review according to the Joanne Briggs Institute's reviewers manual and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses - Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and explanation. We retrieved data from the WHO Digital Health Atlas (DHA), the WHO e-Health country profiles report of 2015, and electronic databases. The protocol has been deposited in an open-source platform - the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/5kzq7. RESULTS: The researchers retrieved 983 digital tools used to strengthen health systems in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 10 years. We included 738 DHIs in the analysis while 245 were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria. We observed a disproportionate distribution of DHIs towards service delivery (81.7%, n = 603), health care providers (91.8%, n = 678), and access and use of information (84.1%, n = 621). Fifty-three percent (53.4%, n = 394) of the solutions are established and 47.5% (n = 582) were aligned to 20% (n = 5) of the system categories. CONCLUSIONS: Sub-Saharan Africa is endowed with digital health solutions in both numbers and distinct functions. It is lacking in coordination, integration, scalability, sustainability, and equitable distribution of investments in digital health. Digital health policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa need to urgently institute coordination mechanisms to terminate unending duplication and disjointed vertical implementations and manage solutions for scale. Central to this would be to build digital health leadership in countries within SSA, adopt standards and interoperability frameworks; advocate for more investments into lagging components, and promote multi-purpose solutions to halt the seeming ""e-chaos"" and progress to sustainable e-health solutions."
Effectiveness of mHealth Interventions in the Control of Lifestyle and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Patients After a Coronary Event: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Cruz-Cobo C, Bernal-Jiménez MÁ, Vázquez-García R, Santi-Cano MJ.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022 Dec 2;10(12):e39593. doi: 10.2196/39593.,Cruz-Cobo C,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2022,2022/12/02,PMC9758644,,10.2196/39593,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is the main cause of death and loss of disability-adjusted life years worldwide. Information and communication technology has become an important part of health care systems, including the innovative cardiac rehabilitation services through mobile phone and mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of different kinds of mHealth programs in changing lifestyle behavior, promoting adherence to treatment, and controlling modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and psychosocial outcomes in patients who have experienced a coronary event. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. A thorough search of the following biomedical databases was conducted: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SciELO, CINAHL, Scopus, The Clinical Trial, and Cochrane. Articles that were randomized clinical trials that involved an intervention consisting of an mHealth program using a mobile app in patients after a coronary event were included. The articles analyzed some of the following variables as outcome variables: changes in lifestyle behavior, cardiovascular risk factors, and anthropometric and psychosocial variables. A meta-analysis of the variables studied was performed with the Cochrane tool. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool; the quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool; and heterogeneity was measured using the I(2) test. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were included in the review, and 20 (87%) were included in the meta-analysis, with a total sample size of 4535 patients. Exercise capacity measured using the 6-minute walk test (mean difference=21.64, 95% CI 12.72-30.55; P<.001), physical activity (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.42, 95% CI 0.04-0.81; P=.03), and adherence to treatment (risk difference=0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.28; P<.001) were significantly superior in the mHealth group. Furthermore, both the physical and mental dimensions of quality of life were better in the mHealth group (SMD=0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.44; P=.004 and SMD=0.27, 95% CI 0.06-0.47; P=.01, respectively). In addition, hospital readmissions for all causes and cardiovascular causes were statistically higher in the control group than in the mHealth group (SMD=-0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.00; P=.04 vs SMD=-0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.00; P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: mHealth technology has a positive effect on patients who have experienced a coronary event in terms of their exercise capacity, physical activity, adherence to medication, and physical and mental quality of life, as well as readmissions for all causes and cardiovascular causes.

Effectiveness of a Combined Web-Based and Ecological Momentary Intervention for Incoming First-Year University Students: Protocol for a 3-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial,"Riordan BC, Moradi S, Carey KB, Conner TS, Jang K, Reid KE, Scarf D.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2018 May 15;7(5):e10164. doi: 10.2196/10164.,Riordan BC,JMIR Res Protoc,2018,2018/05/17,PMC5974455,,10.2196/10164,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol use among university students is common, and those who drink often choose to drink heavily (ie, 4 or more drinks per session for women or 5 or more for men). Web-based interventions (WBIs), in which students complete assessments and receive personalized feedback about their alcohol use, and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile devices as a method of delivering intervention information, are 2 methods that have had some success in reducing alcohol use among university students. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a combined WBI and EMI intervention to reduce alcohol use among university students. METHODS: The study is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized into either a WBI+EMI condition, a WBI-only condition, or an assessment-only control. Our sample will consist of first-year university students, recruited through 5 residential colleges at the University of Otago, New Zealand. All participants will complete an online survey at baseline (ie, before Orientation Week); those in the WBI-only and WBI+EMI conditions will immediately receive personalized feedback (ie, the WBI), whereas participants in the assessment-only condition will receive no feedback. In addition, participants randomized into the WBI+EMI, but not those in the WBI-only or assessment-only groups, will receive 8 Orientation Week (2 per day on nights with large social events) and 6 academic year EMIs (delivered fortnightly). Participants in all conditions will complete brief surveys at the end of the first and second semester and report their weekend alcohol use fortnightly throughout each semester via ecological momentary assessments. RESULTS: The primary hypothesis is that participants in the WBI+EMI group will consume significantly fewer drinks during weekends in their first semester at university compared with WBI-only and assessment-only groups. Secondary hypotheses are that, when compared with the WBI-only and assessment-only groups, the WBI+EMI group will report consuming fewer drinks during Orientation Week, report experiencing fewer negative alcohol-related consequences after first semester, and report lower Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption scores following their first semester. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to a growing body of work investigating the utility of WBIs and EMIs in curbing alcohol consumption. In addition, the study will help to inform policy approaches aimed at curbing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm in university students.

Mobile health applications for improving the sexual health outcomes among adults with chronic diseases: A systematic review,"Karim H, Choobineh H, Kheradbin N, Ravandi MH, Naserpor A, Safdari R.",Digit Health. 2020 Feb 20;6:2055207620906956. doi: 10.1177/2055207620906956. eCollection 2020 Jan-Dec.,Karim H,Digit Health,2020,2020/03/05,PMC7036501,,10.1177/2055207620906956,"AIMS: Chronic diseases may affect sexual health as an important factor for well-being. Mobile health (m-health) interventions have the potential to improve sexual health in patients with chronic conditions. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the published evidence on mobile interventions for sexual health in adults with chronic diseases. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for English language peer-reviewed literature from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2019. Appropriate keywords were identified based on the study's aim. Study selection was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. The full texts of potential studies were reviewed, and final studies were selected. The m-health evidence reporting and assessment (mERA) checklist was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. After data extraction from the studies, data analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. All interventions were delivered through websites, and a positive effect on sexual problems was reported. Prostate and breast cancer were considered in most studies. Interventions were delivered for therapy, self-help and consultation purposes. Quality assessment of studies revealed an acceptable quality of reporting and methodological criteria in the selected studies. Replicability, security, cost assessment and conceptual adaptability were the criteria that had not been considered in any of the reviewed studies. CONCLUSIONS: Reviewed studies showed a positive effect of mobile interventions on sexual health outcomes in chronic patients. For more effective interventions, researchers should design web-based interventions based on users' needs and consider the m-health essential criteria provided by mERA. Additionally, mobile interventions can be more effective in combination with smartphone apps."
Use and Effect of Web-Based Embodied Conversational Agents for Improving Eating Behavior and Decreasing Loneliness Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Kramer LL, Mulder BC, van Velsen L, de Vet E.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Jan 6;10(1):e22186. doi: 10.2196/22186.,Kramer LL,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/01/06,PMC7817356,,10.2196/22186,"BACKGROUND: An unhealthy eating pattern and loneliness negatively influence quality of life in older age. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are a promising way to address these health behaviors in an engaging manner. OBJECTIVE: We aim to (1) identify whether ECAs can persuade community-dwelling older adults to change their dietary behavior and whether ECA use can decrease loneliness, (2) test these pathways to effects, and (3) understand the use of an ECA. METHODS: The web-based eHealth app PACO is a fully automated 8-week intervention in which 2 ECAs engage older adults in dialogue to motivate them to change their dietary behavior and decrease their loneliness. PACO was developed via a human-centered and stakeholder-inclusive design approach and incorporates Self-determination Theory and various behavior change techniques. For this study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial will be performed. There will be 2 cohorts, with 30 participants per cohort. Participants in the first cohort will immediately receive the PACO app for 8 weeks, while participants in the second cohort receive the PACO app after a waiting-list condition of 4 weeks. Participants will be recruited via social media, an online panel, flyers, and advertorials. To be eligible, participants must be at least 65 years of age, must not be in paid employment, and must live alone independently at home. Primary outcomes will be self-assessed via online questionnaires at intake, control, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks, and will include eating behavior and loneliness. In addition, the primary outcome-use-will be measured via data logs. Secondary outcomes will be measured at the same junctures, via either validated, self-assessed, online questionnaires or an optional interview. RESULTS: As of July 2020, we have begun recruiting participants. CONCLUSIONS: By unraveling the mechanisms behind the use of a web-based intervention with ECAs, we hope to gain a fine-grained understanding of both the effectiveness and the use of ECAs in the health context.

Online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) interventions for chronic pain: A systematic literature review,"van de Graaf DL, Trompetter HR, Smeets T, Mols F.",Internet Interv. 2021 Oct 1;26:100465. doi: 10.1016/j.invent.2021.100465. eCollection 2021 Dec.,van de Graaf DL,Internet Interv,2021,2021/10/18,PMC8502909,,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100465,"BACKGROUND: We systematically reviewed all literature concerning online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) interventions for chronic pain to evaluate their (1) ACT content, (2) design characteristics, (3) design rationales, and (4) adherence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed on July 9th, 2020 in; PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Search terms related to: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, chronic pain, and eHealth. Extracted data concerned ACT content, design characteristics, adherence, and design rationales. RESULTS: 20 articles, in which 14 interventions were described, met all inclusion criteria. Adherence and design rationales were described to a limited extent in the included studies. In total, the majority provided an overview of the included ACT processes. In 10 articles it was described that the intervention was delivered via a dedicated website (n = 10), which was sometimes combined with an app (n = 3). Guidance was included in most studies (n = 19). Studies including RCT's (n = 8) reported online ACT interventions to be effective. CONCLUSION: Online ACT interventions for chronic pain have been shown to be effective and have generally been constructed in line with ACT theory. However, the majority of studies does not provide information about the choices to optimize the fit between task, technology, and user. Considerations behind the choices for intervention features as well as design rationales could help to optimize future online ACT interventions. Additionally, consistent attention should be paid to measurement and operationalization of adherence, since this is a crucial link between content, design and effectiveness."
Evaluating the Efficacy of Web-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Treatment of Patients With Bipolar II Disorder and Residual Depressive Symptoms: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Gutierrez G, Stephenson C, Eadie J, Moghimi E, Omrani M, Groll D, Soares CN, Milev R, Vazquez G, Yang M, Alavi N.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 May 19;12:e46157. doi: 10.2196/46157.,Gutierrez G,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/05/04,PMC10238953,,10.2196/46157,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric condition that can significantly impact every aspect of a person's life if left untreated. A subtype of BD, bipolar disorder type II (BD-II), is characterized by long depressive episodes and residual depression symptoms, with short-lived hypomanic episodes. Medication and psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), are the main treatment options for BD-II. CBT specific for BD-II involves the recognition of warning signs, potentially triggering stimuli, and the development of coping skills to increase euthymic periods and improve global functioning. However, access to in-person CBT may be limited by several barriers, including low availability, high costs, and geographical limitations. Thus, web-based adaptations of CBT (e-CBT) have become a promising solution to address these treatment barriers. Nevertheless, e-CBT for the treatment of BD-II remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: The proposed study aims to establish the first e-CBT program specific for the treatment of BD-II with residual depressive symptoms. The primary objective of this study will be to determine the effect of e-CBT in managing BD symptomatology. The secondary objective will be to assess the effects of this e-CBT program on quality of life and resilience. The tertiary objective will involve gathering user feedback using a posttreatment survey to support the continuous improvement and optimization of the proposed program. METHODS: Adult participants (N=170) with a confirmed diagnosis of BD-II experiencing residual depressive symptoms will be randomly assigned to either the e-CBT and treatment as usual (TAU; n=85) group or the TAU (n=85) control group. Participants in the control group will be able to participate in the web-based program after the first 13 weeks. The e-CBT program will consist of 13 weekly web-based modules designed following a validated CBT framework. Participants will complete module-related homework and receive asynchronous personalized feedback from a therapist. TAU will consist of standard treatment services conducted outside of this research study. Depression and manic symptoms, quality of life, and resiliency will be assessed using clinically validated symptomatology questionnaires at baseline, week 6, and week 13. RESULTS: The study received ethics approval in March 2020, and participant recruitment is expected to begin in February 2023 through targeted advertisements and physician referrals. Data collection and analysis are expected to conclude by December 2024. Linear and binomial regression (continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively) will be conducted along with qualitative interpretive methods. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will be the first on the effectiveness of delivering e-CBT for patients with BD-II with residual depressive symptoms. This approach can provide an innovative method to address barriers to in-person psychotherapy by increasing accessibility and decreasing costs.

"Effectiveness of a healthcare-based mobile intervention on sedentary patterns, physical activity, mental well-being and clinical and productivity outcomes in office employees with type 2 diabetes: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Alòs F, Colomer MÀ, Martin-Cantera C, Solís-Muñoz M, Bort-Roig J, Saigi I, Chirveches-Pérez E, Solà-Gonfaus M, Molina-Aragonés JM, Puig-Ribera A.",BMC Public Health. 2022 Jun 29;22(1):1269. doi: 10.1186/s12889-022-13676-x.,Alòs F,BMC Public Health,2022,2022/06/29,PMC9244393,,10.1186/s12889-022-13676-x,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged sedentary time is associated with an increased incidence of chronic disease including type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Given that occupational sedentary time contributes significantly to the total amount of daily sedentariness, incorporating programmes to reduce occupational sedentary time in patients with chronic disease would allow for physical, mental and productivity benefits. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-, medium- and long-term effectiveness of a mHealth programme for sitting less and moving more at work on habitual and occupational sedentary behaviour and physical activity in office staff with DM2. Secondary aims. To evaluate the effectiveness on glycaemic control and lipid profile at 6- and 12-month follow-up; anthropometric profile, blood pressure, mental well-being and work-related post-intervention outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months. METHODS: Multicentre randomized controlled trial. A sample size of 220 patients will be randomly allocated into a control (n = 110) or intervention group (n = 110), with post-intervention follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Health professionals from Spanish Primary Health Care units will randomly invite patients (18-65 years of age) diagnosed with DM2, who have sedentary office desk-based jobs. The control group will receive usual healthcare and information on the health benefits of sitting less and moving more. The intervention group will receive, through a smartphone app and website, strategies and real-time feedback for 13 weeks to change occupational sedentary behaviour. VARIABLES: (1) Subjective and objective habitual and occupational sedentary behaviour and physical activity (Workforce Sitting Questionnaire, Brief Physical Activity Assessment Tool, activPAL3TM); 2) Glucose, HbA1c; 3) Weight, height, waist circumference; 4) Total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides; (5) Systolic, diastolic blood pressure; (6) Mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being); (7) Presenteeism (Work Limitations Questionnaire); (8) Impact of work on employees  health, sickness absence (6th European Working Conditions Survey); (9) Job-related mental strain (Job Content Questionnaire). Differences between groups pre- and post- intervention on the average value of the variables will be analysed. DISCUSSION: If the mHealth intervention is effective in reducing sedentary time and increasing physical activity in office employees with DM2, health professionals would have a low-cost tool for the control of patients with chronic disease.

Impact of Mobile Health Devices for the Detection of Atrial Fibrillation: Systematic Review,"Biersteker TE, Schalij MJ, Treskes RW.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2021 Apr 28;9(4):e26161. doi: 10.2196/26161.,Biersteker TE,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2021,2021/04/28,PMC8116993,,10.2196/26161,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, and its prevalence is increasing. Early diagnosis is important to reduce the risk of stroke. Mobile health (mHealth) devices, such as single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) devices, have been introduced to the worldwide consumer market over the past decade. Recent studies have assessed the usability of these devices for detection of AF, but it remains unclear if the use of mHealth devices leads to a higher AF detection rate. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to conduct a systematic review of the diagnostic detection rate of AF by mHealth devices compared with traditional outpatient follow-up. Study participants were aged 16 years or older and had an increased risk for an arrhythmia and an indication for ECG follow-up-for instance, after catheter ablation or presentation to the emergency department with palpitations or (near) syncope. The intervention was the use of an mHealth device, defined as a novel device for the diagnosis of rhythm disturbances, either a handheld electronic device or a patch-like device worn on the patient's chest. Control was standard (traditional) outpatient care, defined as follow-up via general practitioner or regular outpatient clinic visits with a standard 12-lead ECG or Holter monitoring. The main outcome measures were the odds ratio (OR) of AF detection rates. METHODS: Two reviewers screened the search results, extracted data, and performed a risk of bias assessment. A heterogeneity analysis was performed, forest plot made to summarize the results of the individual studies, and albatross plot made to allow the P values to be interpreted in the context of the study sample size. RESULTS: A total of 3384 articles were identified after a database search, and 14 studies with a 4617 study participants were selected. All studies but one showed a higher AF detection rate in the mHealth group compared with the control group (OR 1.00-35.71), with all RCTs showing statistically significant increases of AF detection (OR 1.54-19.16). Statistical heterogeneity between studies was considerable, with a Q of 34.1 and an I(2) of 61.9, and therefore it was decided to not pool the results into a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of 13 of 14 studies support the effectiveness of mHealth interventions compared with standard care, study results could not be pooled due to considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity. However, smartphone-connectable ECG devices provide patients with the ability to document a rhythm disturbance more easily than with standard care, which may increase empowerment and engagement with regard to their illness. Clinicians must beware of overdiagnosis of AF, as it is not yet clear when an mHealth-detected episode of AF must be deemed significant."
Telemedical Approaches to Managing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus During COVID-19: Systematic Review,"Eberle C, Stichling S.",JMIR Pediatr Parent. 2021 Aug 5;4(3):e28630. doi: 10.2196/28630.,Eberle C,JMIR Pediatr Parent,2021,2021/06/03,PMC8345174,,10.2196/28630,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in China, and the disease caused by the virus (COVID-19) was rapidly classified as a pandemic. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are considered to be at risk for severe COVID-19. In the context of the pandemic, there are serious concerns regarding adverse effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes for women with GDM. Effective treatments for patients with GDM are therefore particularly important. Due to contact restrictions and infection risks, digital approaches such as telemedicine are suitable alternatives. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to summarize currently available evidence on maternal and offspring outcomes of pregnant women with GDM and COVID-19 and to examine telemedical interventions to improve maternal glycemic control during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Publications were systematically identified by searching the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, and CINAHL databases for studies published up to March 2021. We sorted the COVID-19 studies by outcome and divided the telemedical intervention studies into web-based and app-based groups. We analyzed case reports (COVID-19) and both randomized and nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (telemedicine). To determine the change in glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), we pooled appropriate studies and calculated the differences in means, with 95% CIs, for the intervention and control groups at the end of the interventions. RESULTS: Regarding COVID-19 studies, we identified 11 case reports, 3 letters, 1 case series, and 1 retrospective single-center study. In total, 41 patients with GDM and COVID-19 were analyzed. The maternal and neonatal outcomes were extremely heterogeneous. We identified adverse outcomes for mother and child through the interaction of GDM and COVID-19, such as cesarean deliveries and low Apgar scores. Furthermore, we selected 9 telemedicine-related articles: 6 were randomized controlled trials, 2 were clinical controlled trials, and 1 was a quasi-experimental design. In total, we analyzed 480 patients with GDM in the intervention groups and 494 in the control groups. Regarding the quality of the 9 telemedical studies, 4 were rated as strong, 4 as moderate, and 1 as weak. Telemedical interventions can contribute to favorable impacts on HbA(1c) and fasting blood glucose values in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meta-analysis revealed a mean difference in HbA(1c) of -0.19% (95% CI 0.34% to 0.03%) for all telemedical interventions, -0.138% (95% CI -0.24% to -0.04%) for the web-based interventions, and -0.305% (96% CI -0.88% to 0.27%) for the app-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is an effective approach in the context of COVID-19 and GDM because it enables social distancing and represents optimal care of patients with GDM, especially with regard to glycemic control, which is very important in view of the identified adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Further research is needed."
Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Process Evaluation of BetterBrains: A Person-Centered Online Intervention to Delay Cognitive Decline in Adults at Risk of Dementia,"Ayton D, Pirotta S, Morello R, Rosenich E, Barton C, Lavale A, Pase MP, Maruff P, Yassi N, Brodtmann A, Lim YY, Barker A; BetterBrains Research Group.",J Alzheimers Dis. 2022;90(4):1689-1703. doi: 10.3233/JAD-220341.,Ayton D,J Alzheimers Dis,2022,2022/10/31,,,10.3233/JAD-220341,"BACKGROUND: The BetterBrains Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will evaluate the effectiveness of an online, person-centered, risk factor management, coaching intervention in community-dwelling, healthy adults at risk of cognitive decline. Multi-component interventions are challenging to evaluate due to program complexity and personalization to individual needs and contexts. This paper describes a multi-level process evaluation conducted alongside the BetterBrains RCT. OBJECTIVE: To understand how and why the BetterBrains intervention was effective or ineffective at reducing cognitive decline in healthy adults whilst considering the context in which it was implemented. METHODS: 1,510 non cognitively-deteriorated community-dwelling adults aged 40-70 years old at risk of cognitive decline will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. All BetterBrains intervention participants, coaches, and the research team will be included in the evaluation. A mixed-methods design will be used, guided by The Framework for Implementation Fidelity and the program logic model. Data will be sourced from interviews, focus groups, surveys, BetterBrains coach notes, participant weekly check-in surveys, and audio recordings of intervention coaching sessions. Quantitative data will be analyzed via descriptive and inferential statistics and qualitative data will be analyzed using content and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The process evaluation will provide information about contextual and influencing factors related to the implementation of BetterBrains and the RCT outcomes. CONCLUSION: Understanding how BetterBrains was implemented and its associated impacts will inform the translation of the program into community and clinical settings, providing easy access to online, personalized dementia prevention services."
The Effectiveness of eHealth Interventions on Lifestyle Modification in Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Kwon OY, Choi JY, Jang Y.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Jan 23;25:e37487. doi: 10.2196/37487.,Kwon OY,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/01/23,PMC9903182,,10.2196/37487,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in parallel with the epidemic of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle modification is a crucial strategy for the treatment of NAFLD, which can lead to a reduction in liver fat with concomitant weight loss. The use of eHealth technologies is an effective approach to improve health outcomes in patients as they do not have any time and space limitations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate published eHealth intervention studies for the improvement of lifestyle modifications among patients with NAFLD and to provide recommendations for future studies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Five electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science) were searched for studies reporting the effect of lifestyle modification intervention using eHealth in patients with NAFLD published from inception to November 3, 2022. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by 3 researchers independently. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. RESULTS: In total, 2688 records were identified, and 41 full-text articles were assessed. Seven studies were included in the systematic review. The participants of all interventions were 1257 individuals with NAFLD, and the mean age ranged from 38.3 to 57.9 years. The duration of the interventions was 3-24 months, and all interventions were categorized into 3 types: internet-based computers, telephones, and mobile apps. Of these, 4 studies were randomized controlled trials and were included in the meta-analysis: 3 studies for body weight and BMI and 4 studies for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). According to the meta-analysis, clear improvements in BMI (P=.02; 95% CI -1.01 to -0.10), AST (P=.02; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.13), and ALT (P=.01; 95% CI -1.28 to -0.15) were observed in the eHealth intervention as compared with the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle modification interventions using eHealth technologies are significantly effective for BMI, AST, and ALT in patients with NAFLD. Future research should conduct interventions with larger sample sizes and evaluate whether these interventions have sustained benefits, and how we can make these eHealth methods most effective on a large scale."
The use of mHealth apps to improve hospital nurses' mental health and well-being: A systematic review,"Moore C, Kelly S, Melnyk BM.",Worldviews Evid Based Nurs. 2024 Apr;21(2):110-119. doi: 10.1111/wvn.12716. Epub 2024 Mar 15.,Moore C,Worldviews Evid Based Nurs,2024,2024/03/16,,,10.1111/wvn.12716,"BACKGROUND: Nursing well-being has become a heightened focus since the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses are leaving the profession early in their careers or retiring sooner than expected. Those who remain in the workforce report higher levels of burnout, anxiety, depression, and exhaustion. There is concern that there may be a shortage of at least half a million nurses by 2030. AIMS: This systematic review aimed to investigate the evidence of using a mental health promotion mHealth app to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full Text, Professional Development Collection, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, Sociological Collection, PsycInfo, Embase, and PubMed with search dates of January 2012-November 15, 2022. The mHealth intervention needed to be asynchronously delivered through a smartphone with hospital nurse participants to be included in this review. RESULTS: Of the 157 articles screened for this review, six were included. Primary outcome variables were anxiety, burnout, coping, depression, self-efficacy, stress, well-being, and work engagement. Intervention types included mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), stress inoculation therapy (SIT), psychoeducation, and stress management. Anxiety, depression, well-being, and burnout improved with MBIs; depression improved with CBT; and anxiety and active coping improved with SIT. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: This review demonstrated promising findings in using mHealth apps to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. However, more randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes may reveal which type of mHealth app and how much exposure to the intervention is more effective in improving specific mental health symptoms. Longitudinal follow-up is also recommended to study sustainability of the mental health improvements."

Improving mental health literacy using web- or app-based interventions: A scoping review,"Tian L, Wong EL, Dong D, Cheung AW, Chan SK, Cao Y, Mok PKH, Zhou L, Xu RH.",Digit Health. 2024 Apr 5;10:20552076241243133. doi: 10.1177/20552076241243133. eCollection 2024 Jan-Dec.,Tian L,Digit Health,2024,2024/04/08,PMC10998496,,10.1177/20552076241243133,"BACKGROUND: Given the rapid advancement in technology, the Internet has grown to play a significant role in the field of healthcare. Individuals can now access a profusion of easily available materials for self-management of their health. The purpose of this review is to describe Web/App-based interventions that are primarily or secondarily designed to improve mental health literacy (MHL) and to investigate the effectiveness of online interventions for improving mental health. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A scoping review was conducted by searching five databases: PsycINFO, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The search was limited to peer-reviewed journals published in English between 2000 and 2022. Studies focusing on enhancements of MHL or its constituent components were included. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. The interventions primarily targeted patients or individuals exhibiting symptoms of mental disorders, with a higher representation of female participants. All the interventions yielded positive outcomes. The included studies were categorized according to three themes: knowledge, attitude, and self-care skills. Although numerous studies have focused on knowledge improvement, research on interventions targeting self-care skills is scarce. Furthermore, existing literature on knowledge enhancement is limited in terms of the coverage of risk factors. CONCLUSION: This review indicates gaps in web/app interventions including limited evidence on risk factors, inconsistent help-seeking awareness, and inadequate self-care skills training. Further research is critically needed to address these deficiencies and promote comprehensive MHL."
Mobile health interventions for cancer patient education: A scoping review,"Samadbeik M, Garavand A, Aslani N, Sajedimehr N, Fatehi F.",Int J Med Inform. 2023 Nov;179:105214. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2023.105214. Epub 2023 Sep 9.,Samadbeik M,Int J Med Inform,2023,2023/09/20,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2023.105214,"INTRODUCTION: Mobile health (mHealth) is using mobile devices and applications to deliver health information and services. mHealth has been increasingly applied in cancer care to support patients in various aspects of their disease journey. This scoping review aimed to explore the current evidence on the use of mHealth interventions for cancer patient education. METHODS: This scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews. We searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane) using a combination of keywords related to mHealth, cancer, and education. After finding articles at the initial search the screening has been done based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We included only original research articles and excluded all other types of publications, such as review papers, reports, editorials, letters to the editor, book reviews, short communications, conference proceedings, graduate dissertations, protocols, and commentaries. We extracted data on the characteristics and outcomes of the included studies using a standardized form. We conducted a narrative synthesis and inductive content analysis to summarize and categorize the evidence. RESULTS: Out of 2131 records found in the initial search, 28 full-text articles reported on the use of mHealth educational interventions for cancer patients. The majority of the studies focused on breast cancer patients (n = 21, 75%). The most common type of mHealth intervention was exercise-based education delivered through various media such as text messages, videos, audio, images, and social networks. The main objectives of mHealth educational interventions were to enhance self-management skills, improve psychological well-being, and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors among cancer patients. The reported outcomes of mHealth interventions included reduced chemotherapy-related side effects, improved mental health, improved quality of life and lifestyle, and better pain management. CONCLUSION: This scoping review showed that mHealth is a promising and feasible modality for delivering educational interventions to cancer patients. However, more rigorous and diverse studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions for different types of cancers, stages, and settings."
Digital Therapeutic Care and Decision Support Interventions for People With Low Back Pain: Systematic Review,"Lewkowicz D, Slosarek T, Wernicke S, Winne A, Wohlbrandt AM, Bottinger E.",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol. 2021 Nov 19;8(4):e26612. doi: 10.2196/26612.,Lewkowicz D,JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,2021,2021/11/22,PMC8663573,,10.2196/26612,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of worldwide years lost because of disability, with a tremendous economic burden for health care systems. Digital therapeutic care (DTC) programs provide a scalable, universally accessible, and low-cost approach to the multidisciplinary treatment of LBP. Moreover, novel decision support interventions such as personalized feedback messages, push notifications, and data-driven activity recommendations amplify DTC by guiding the user through the program while aiming to increase overall engagement and sustainable behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to synthesize recent scientific literature on the impact of DTC apps for people with LBP and outline the implementation of add-on decision support interventions, including their effect on user retention and attrition rates. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, from March 1, 2016, to October 15, 2020, in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and conducted this review based on related previously published systematic reviews. Besides randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we also included study designs with the evidence level of at least a retrospective comparative study. This enables the consideration of real-world user-generated data and provides information regarding the adoption and effectiveness of DTC apps in a real-life setting. For the appraisal of the risk of bias, we used the Risk of Bias 2 Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool for the RCTs and nonrandomized trials, respectively. The included studies were narratively synthesized regarding primary and secondary outcome measures, DTC components, applied decision support interventions, user retention, and attrition rates. RESULTS: We retrieved 1388 citations, of which 12 studies are included in this review. Of the 12 studies, 6 (50%) were RCTs and 6 (50%) were nonrandomized trials. In all included studies, lower pain levels and increased functionality compared with baseline values were observed in the DTC intervention group. A between-group comparison revealed significant improvements in pain and functionality levels in 67% (4/6) of the RCTs. The study population was mostly homogeneous, with predominantly female, young to middle-aged participants of normal to moderate weight. The methodological quality assessment revealed moderate to high risks of biases, especially in the nonrandomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrates the benefits of DTC for people with LBP. There is also evidence that decision support interventions benefit overall engagement with the app and increase participants' ability to self-manage their recovery process. Finally, including retrospective evaluation studies of real-world user-generated data in future systematic reviews of digital health intervention trials can reveal new insights into the benefits, challenges, and real-life adoption of DTC programs."
Understanding Engagement Strategies in Digital Interventions for Mental Health Promotion: Scoping Review,"Saleem M, Kühne L, De Santis KK, Christianson L, Brand T, Busse H.",JMIR Ment Health. 2021 Dec 20;8(12):e30000. doi: 10.2196/30000.,Saleem M,JMIR Ment Health,2021,2021/12/21,PMC8726056,,10.2196/30000,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions offer a solution to address the high demand for mental health promotion, especially when facing physical contact restrictions or lacking accessibility. Engagement with digital interventions is critical for their effectiveness; however, retaining users' engagement throughout the intervention is challenging. It remains unclear what strategies facilitate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to conduct a scoping review to investigate user engagement strategies and methods to evaluate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion in adults. METHODS: This scoping review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews. The search was conducted in 7 electronic databases from inception to April 2020. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: adult (aged >/=18 years) users of digital interventions for mental health promotion from the general population; any digital intervention for mental health promotion; and user engagement strategies described in the intervention design. We extracted the following data items: study characteristics, digital intervention (type and engagement strategy), evaluation of engagement strategy (method and result specifying whether the strategy was effective at facilitating engagement), and features of engagement (extent of use and subjective experience of users). RESULTS: A total of 2766 studies were identified, of which 16 (0.58%) met the inclusion criteria. The 16 studies included randomized controlled trials (6/16, 37%), studies analyzing process data (5/16, 31%), observational studies (3/16, 19%), and qualitative studies (2/16, 13%). The digital interventions for mental health promotion were either web based (12/16, 75%) or mobile app based (4/16, 25%). The engagement strategies included personalized feedback about intervention content or users' mental health status; guidance regarding content and progress through e-coaching; social forums, and interactivity with peers; content gamification; reminders; and flexibility and ease of use. These engagement strategies were deemed effective based on qualitative user feedback or responses on questionnaires or tools (4/16, 25%), usability data (5/16, 31%), or both (7/16, 44%). Most studies identified personalized support in the form of e-coaching, peer support through a social platform, personalized feedback, or joint videoconference sessions as an engaging feature. CONCLUSIONS: Personalized support during the intervention, access to social support, and personalized feedback seem to promote engagement with digital interventions for mental health promotion. These findings need to be interpreted with caution because the included studies were heterogeneous, had small sample sizes, and typically did not address engagement as the primary outcome. Despite the importance of user engagement for the effectiveness of digital interventions, this field has not yet received much attention. Further research is needed on the effectiveness of different strategies required to facilitate user engagement in digital interventions for mental health promotion."
Physical activity self-efficacy online intervention for adults with obesity: protocol for a feasibility study,"Lee S, Lahoda K, Myers ND, Horowitz A, Chiu K, Begdache L, Einav E.",Pilot Feasibility Stud. 2024 Feb 26;10(1):40. doi: 10.1186/s40814-024-01468-6.,Lee S,Pilot Feasibility Stud,2024,2024/02/26,PMC10895849,,10.1186/s40814-024-01468-6,"BACKGROUND: Even without weight loss, adults with obesity can greatly benefit from regular physical activity. The Physical Activity Self-efficacy (PAS) intervention is an online behavioral intervention newly developed to promote physical activity in adults with obesity by providing capability-enhancing learning opportunities. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the protocol for a feasibility study designed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the PAS online intervention for adults with obesity recruited from a local weight management center in the United States of America (USA). METHODS: The study design is a prospective, double-blind, parallel-group individual randomized pilot trial. Thirty participants will be randomly assigned to the PAS group or usual care group to achieve a 1:1 group assignment. Recruitment of participants is scheduled to begin on 1 March 2024 at a local weight management center within a private healthcare system in the USA. There are six eligibility criteria for participation in this study (e.g., a body mass index >/= 25.00 kg/m(2)). Eligibility verification and data collection will be conducted online. Three waves of data collection will take up to 14 weeks depending on participants' progress in the study. The primary feasibility outcomes in the study will be: (a) participation rate, (b) engagement behavior, and (c) a preliminary effect size estimate for the effect of the PAS intervention on physical activity. Instruments designed to measure demographic information, anthropometric characteristics, self-efficacy, and acceptability will be included in the survey battery. A research-grade accelerometer will be used to measure free-living physical activity objectively. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical models under an intention-to-treat approach. DISCUSSION: Results are intended to inform the preparation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05935111, registered 7 July 2023."

However, up to 50% of blood relatives are unaware of relevant genetic information, suggesting that potential benefits of genetic testing are not communicated effectively within family networks. Technology can facilitate communication and genetic education within HBOC families. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to develop the K-CASCADE (Korean-Cancer Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) cohort in Korea by expanding an infrastructure developed by the CASCADE (Cancer Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) Consortium in Switzerland; develop a digital health intervention to support the communication of cancer predisposition for Swiss and Korean HBOC families, based on linguistic and cultural adaptation of the Family Gene Toolkit; evaluate its efficacy on primary (family communication of genetic results and cascade testing) and secondary (psychological distress, genetic literacy, active coping, and decision making) outcomes; and explore its translatability using the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework. METHODS: The digital health intervention will be available in French, German, Italian, Korean, and English and can be accessed via the web, mobile phone, or tablet (ie, device-agnostic). K-CASCADE cohort of Korean HBOC mutation carriers and relatives will be based on the CASCADE infrastructure. Narrative data collected through individual interviews or mini focus groups from 20 to 24 HBOC family members per linguistic region and 6-10 health care providers involved in genetic services will identify the local cultures and context, and inform the content of the tailored messages. The efficacy of the digital health intervention against a comparison website will be assessed in a randomized trial with 104 HBOC mutation carriers (52 in each study arm). The translatability of the digital health intervention will be assessed using survey data collected from HBOC families and health care providers. RESULTS: Funding was received in October 2019. It is projected that data collection will be completed by January 2023 and results will be published in fall 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This study addresses the continuum of translational research, from developing an international research infrastructure and adapting an existing digital health intervention to testing its efficacy in a randomized controlled trial and exploring its translatability using an established framework. Adapting existing interventions, rather than developing new ones, takes advantage of previous valid experiences without duplicating efforts. Culturally sensitive web-based interventions that enhance family communication and understanding of genetic cancer risk are timely. This collaboration creates a research infrastructure between Switzerland and Korea that can be scaled up to cover other hereditary cancer syndromes.

Mobile Apps for Weight Management: A Scoping Review,"Rivera J, McPherson A, Hamilton J, Birken C, Coons M, Iyer S, Agarwal A, Lalloo C, Stinson J.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2016 Jul 26;4(3):e87. doi: 10.2196/mhealth.5115.,Rivera J,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2016,2016/07/28,PMC4978862,,10.2196/mhealth.5115,"BACKGROUND: Obesity remains a major public health concern. Mobile apps for weight loss/management are found to be effective for improving health outcomes in adults and adolescents, and are pursued as a cost-effective and scalable intervention for combating overweight and obesity. In recent years, the commercial market for 'weight loss apps' has expanded at rapid pace, yet little is known regarding the evidence-based quality of these tools for weight control. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the inclusion of evidence-based strategies, health care expert involvement, and scientific evaluation of commercial mobile apps for weight loss/management. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted between July 2014 and July 2015 of the official app stores for four major mobile operating systems. Three raters independently identified apps with a stated goal of weight loss/management, as well as weight loss/management apps targeted to pediatric users. All discrepancies regarding selection were resolved through discussion with a fourth rater. Metadata from all included apps were abstracted into a standard assessment criteria form and the evidence-based strategies, health care expert involvement, and scientific evaluation of included apps was assessed. Evidence-based strategies included: self-monitoring, goal-setting, physical activity support, healthy eating support, weight and/or health assessment, personalized feedback, motivational strategies, and social support. RESULTS: A total of 393 apps were included in this review. Self-monitoring was most common (139/393, 35.3%), followed by physical activity support (108/393, 27.5%), weight assessment (100/393, 25.4%), healthy eating support (91/393, 23.2%), goal-setting (84/393, 21.4%), motivational strategies (28/393, 7.1%), social support (21/393, 5.3%), and personalized feedback (7/393, 1.8%). Of apps, 0.8% (3/393) underwent scientific evaluation and 0.3% (1/393) reported health care expert involvement. No apps were comprehensive in the assessment criteria, with the majority of apps meeting less than two criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial mobile apps for weight loss/management lack important evidence-based features, do not involve health care experts in their development process, and have not undergone rigorous scientific testing. This calls into question the validity of apps' claims regarding their effectiveness and safety, at a time when the availability and growth in adoption of these tools is rapidly increasing. Collaborative efforts between developers, researchers, clinicians, and patients are needed to develop and test high-quality, evidence-based mobile apps for weight loss/management before they are widely disseminated in commercial markets."
Lifestyle interventions delivered by eHealth in chronic kidney disease: A scoping review,"Curtis F, Burton JO, Butt A, Dhaliwal HK, Graham-Brown MMP, Lightfoot CJ, Rawat R, Smith AC, Wilkinson TJ, March DS.",PLoS One. 2024 Jan 24;19(1):e0297107. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0297107. eCollection 2024.,Curtis F,PLoS One,2024,2024/01/24,PMC10807786,,10.1371/journal.pone.0297107,"A method of overcoming barriers associated with implementing lifestyle interventions in CKD may be through the use of eHealth technologies. The aim of this review was to provide an up-to-date overview of the literature on this topic. Four bibliographical databases, two trial registers, and one database for conference proceedings were searched from inception to August 2023. Studies were eligible if they reported a lifestyle intervention using eHealth technologies. A narrative synthesis of the findings from the included studies structured around the type of eHealth intervention was presented. Where a sufficient number of studies overlapped in terms of the type of intervention and outcome measure these were brought together in a direction of effect plot. There were 54 included articles, of which 23 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The main component of the intervention for the included studies was mobile applications (n = 23), with the majority being in the dialysis population (n = 22). The majority of eHealth interventions were reported to be feasible and acceptable to participants. However, there was limited evidence that they were efficacious in improving clinical outcomes with the exception of blood pressure, intradialytic weight gain, potassium, and sodium. Although eHealth interventions appear acceptable and feasible to participants, there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for specific interventions to be implemented into clinical care. Properly powered RCTs which not only demonstrate efficacy, but also address barriers to implementation are needed to enhance widespread adoption."
"Fussy Eating Rescue, a mobile-web app for responsive feeding practises among parents of toddlers: protocol for a pilot randomised controlled feasibility trial","Markides BR, Hesketh KD, Maddison R, Laws R, Denney-Wilson E, Campbell KJ.",Pilot Feasibility Stud. 2023 Jul 22;9(1):128. doi: 10.1186/s40814-023-01278-2.,Markides BR,Pilot Feasibility Stud,2023,2023/07/22,PMC10362701,,10.1186/s40814-023-01278-2,"BACKGROUND: Fussy eating is most often a developmentally typical behaviour, generally presenting during toddlerhood. However, up to half of parents of young children are concerned about fussy eating, and this concern may mediate the use of nonresponsive feeding practises, such as coercive or unstructured feeding and using food to reward eating. Despite the high prevalence of parental concern for fussy eating and the negative impacts nonresponsive feeding practises have on children's health and diets, no previous digital intervention to improve the feeding practises of parents of toddlers concerned about fussy eating has been evaluated. AIM: This article describes the protocol of a randomised controlled feasibility pilot aiming to evaluate Fussy Eating Rescue, a purely web app based intervention for parents of toddlers. The primary aim is to investigate feasibility and acceptability; secondary aims are to explore indications of intervention effect on parents' feeding practises or children's eating behaviours. METHODS: Fussy Eating Rescue features include: (1) a Tracker, that allows parents to track repeated offers of food, (2) Topics, providing information on fussy eating, effective feeding strategies, and general nutrition, (3) Rescues, containing quick references to material supporting Topics contents, (4) Recipes, and (5) SMS notifications. Parents of toddlers (12-36 months old, n = 50) who have concerns about fussy eating will be recruited via Facebook. Parents will be randomised to an intervention group, which receives access to the app for 6 weeks, or to wait-listed control. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6 weeks after app use, using online questionnaires and app usage statistics. Primary outcomes include participant retention rate, intervention engagement, app usability, perceived ease in using the app, perceived usefulness of the app, and user satisfaction. Secondary outcome measures include parents' feeding practises and children's eating behaviours. DISCUSSION: Results will inform whether Fussy Eating Rescue is a feasible way to engage parents concerned for their toddler's fussy eating behaviours. If feasible and acceptable to users, a larger trial will further examine the efficacy of the Fussy Eating app in improving parents' feeding practises and children's eating behaviours. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on 15 July, 2021 (ACTRN12621000925842)."
PROTOCOL: Technology-based and digital interventions for intimate partner violence: A meta-analysis and systematic review,"Emezue C, Bloom TL.",Campbell Syst Rev. 2021 Jan 14;17(1):e1132. doi: 10.1002/cl2.1132. eCollection 2021 Mar.,Emezue C,Campbell Syst Rev,2021,2023/04/13,PMC8356356,,10.1002/cl2.1132,"INTRODUCTION: Studies show digital interventions such as mobile and wireless platforms (e.g., smartphone apps, text messaging) and web-based platforms (online support groups and telehealth services) can improve the mental health outcomes for victims/survivors of partner abuse. Depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety are three to five times higher among victims than nonvictims and are thus popular targets of digital interventions. Even then, the evidence is scant. The current review uses both narrative and quantitative (meta-analysis) techniques to present extensive evidence on the effects of intimate partner violence (IPV) digital interventions on the mental health outcomes among survivors of partner violence across all genders and ages, specifically, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. This is the first meta-analysis on IPV-related mental health outcomes targeted by digital interventions. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize current evidence on the intervention and treatment effects of digital and technology-based interventions (mHealth and eHealth) addressing IPV mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and PTSD) among survivors of IPV. This study's research questions are as follows: (a) What are the overall average treatment effects of IPV digital interventions on IPV survivors' mental health outcomes? (b) Do these mental health outcomes vary based on methodological study designs, sample characteristics, and intervention characteristics? METHODS: An extensive search strategy will be utilized to find qualifying studies. Various electronic bibliographic databases will be searched for studies since 2009 (coinciding with the onset of mobile health interventions). Other databases, such as government databases, grey literature databases, trial registers, specialty journals, and citations in other studies will be searched. Also, we will search ""grey databases,"" such as Google Scholar. Ethical and safety concerns preclude the randomization of IPV survivors to specific intervention conditions. Therefore, we will not exclude studies based on a lack of random assignment. Studies will be full-text accessible, published in any language (translatable into English). We will also contact researchers where needed data is missing in their report. Neither language, study location, nor study settings will be a limiter for searches. Keyword and MeSH headings will be used. Effect sizes (Hedges' g) will be estimated with a Type I error rate set at an alpha of .05. RESULTS: All studies will measure IPV-related mental health as an outcome and provide outcome data to calculate effect sizes for PTSD, anxiety, depression, and victimization (physical, psychological, and sexual violence). CONCLUSION: Digital interventions may clinically reduce depression, anxiety, PTSD, and IPV victimization. Summary effect sizes ranging from small to large will signal the usefulness of digital interventions to IPV survivors contending with common mental health issues. Future studies beyond this one may identify other active intervention ingredients of digital interventions, best modes of delivery, and guidelines to increase their feasibility and acceptability."
Mobile Health Interventions for Improving Health Outcomes in Youth: A Meta-analysis,"Fedele DA, Cushing CC, Fritz A, Amaro CM, Ortega A.",JAMA Pediatr. 2017 May 1;171(5):461-469. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.0042.,Fedele DA,JAMA Pediatr,2017,2017/03/21,PMC6037338,,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.0042,"IMPORTANCE: Mobile health interventions are increasingly popular in pediatrics; however, it is unclear how effective these interventions are in changing health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of mobile health interventions for improving health outcomes in youth 18 years or younger. DATA SOURCES: Studies published through November 30, 2016, were collected through PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Center, and PsychINFO. Backward and forward literature searches were conducted on articles meeting study inclusion criteria. Search terms included telemedicine, eHealth, mobile health, mHealth, app, and mobile application. STUDY SELECTION: Search results were limited to infants, children, adolescents, or young adults when possible. Studies were included if quantitative methods were used to evaluate an application of mobile intervention technology in a primary or secondary capacity to promote or modify health behavior in youth 18 years or younger. Studies were excluded if the article was an unpublished dissertation or thesis, the mean age of participants was older than 18 years, the study did not assess a health behavior and disease outcome, or the article did not include sufficient statistics. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied by 2 independent coders with 20% overlap. Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37 unique studies with a total of 29 822 participants) met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37 unique studies) with a total of 29 822 participants met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were calculated from statistical tests that could be converted to standardized mean differences. All aggregate effect sizes and moderator variables were tested using random-effects models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in health behavior or disease control. RESULTS: A total of 29 822 participants were included in the studies. In studies that reported sex, the total number of females was 11 226 (53.2%). Of those reporting age, the average was 11.35 years. The random effects aggregate effect size of mobile health interventions was significant (n = 37; Cohen d = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.29). The random effects model indicated that providing mobile health intervention to a caregiver increased the strength of the intervention effect. Studies that involved caregivers in the intervention produced effect sizes (n = 16; Cohen d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18-0.39) larger than those that did not include caregivers (n = 21; Cohen d = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.25). Other coded variables did not moderate study effect size. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Mobile health interventions appear to be a viable health behavior change intervention modality for youth. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, mobile health interventions offer promise in improving public health."
A Multimodal mHealth Intervention (FeatForward) to Improve Physical Activity Behavior in Patients with High Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: Rationale and Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Agboola S, Palacholla RS, Centi A, Kvedar J, Jethwani K.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2016 May 12;5(2):e84. doi: 10.2196/resprot.5489.,Agboola S,JMIR Res Protoc,2016,2016/05/14,PMC4882414,,10.2196/resprot.5489,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors contributing to the rising rates of chronic diseases and has been associated with deleterious health outcomes in patients with chronic disease conditions. We developed a mobile phone app, FeatForward, to increase the level of physical activity in patients with cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors. This intervention is expected to result in an overall improvement in patient health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a mobile phone-based app, FeatForward, on physical activity levels and other CMR factors in patients with chronic conditions. METHODS: The study will be implemented as a 2-arm randomized controlled trial with 300 adult patients with chronic conditions over a 6-month follow-up period. Participants will be assigned to either the intervention group receiving the FeatForward app and standard care versus a control group who will receive only usual care. The difference in physical activity levels between the control group and intervention group will be measured as the primary outcome. We will also evaluate the effect of this intervention on secondary measures including clinical outcome changes in global CMR factors (glycated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, waist circumference, Serum lipids, C-reactive protein), health-related quality of life, health care usage, including attendance of scheduled clinic visits and hospitalizations, usability, and satisfaction, participant engagement with the FeatForward app, physician engagement with physician portal, and willingness to engage in physical activity. Instruments that will be used in evaluating secondary outcomes include the Short-Form (SF)-12, app usability and satisfaction questionnaires, physician satisfaction questionnaire. The intention-to-treat approach will be used to evaluate outcomes. All outcomes will be measured longitudinally at baseline, midpoint (3 months), and 6 months. Our primary outcome, physical activity, will be assessed by mixed-model analysis of variance with intervention assignment as between-group factor and time as within-subject factor. A similar approach will be used to analyze continuous secondary outcomes while categorical outcomes will be analyzed by chi-square test. RESULTS: The study is still in progress and we hope to have the results by the end of 2016. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile phone-based app, FeatForward, could lead to significant improvements in physical activity and other CMR factors in patients."
Effectiveness of Mobile Health Technology Interventions for Patients With Heart Failure: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Kitsiou S, Vatani H, Paré G, Gerber BS, Buchholz SW, Kansal MM, Leigh J, Masterson Creber RM.",Can J Cardiol. 2021 Aug;37(8):1248-1259. doi: 10.1016/j.cjca.2021.02.015. Epub 2021 Mar 3.,Kitsiou S,Can J Cardiol,2021,2021/03/05,,,10.1016/j.cjca.2021.02.015,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a complex and serious condition associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of mobile health (mHealth) interventions compared with usual care in patients with HF. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth interventions. Primary outcomes included: all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, HF-related hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalizations. Meta-analyses using a random effects model were performed for all outcomes. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were evaluated using the Cochrane Tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs involving 4389 patients were included. Compared with usual care, mHealth interventions reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.97; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 2.1%; high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53-0.91; ARR, 2.9%; high-quality evidence), and HF hospitalizations (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.88; ARR, 5%; high-quality evidence), but had no effect on all-cause hospitalizations. Results were driven by mHealth interventions with remote monitoring and clinical feedback, which were associated with larger reductions than stand-alone mHealth interventions. However, subgroup differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth interventions with remote monitoring and clinical feedback reduce mortality and HF-related hospitalizations, but might not reduce all-cause hospitalizations in patients with HF. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy of stand-alone mHealth interventions as well as active features of mHealth that contribute to efficacy."
"Methods, Indicators, and End-User Involvement in the Evaluation of Digital Health Interventions for the Public: Scoping Review","Weirauch V, Soehnchen C, Burmann A, Meister S.",J Med Internet Res. 2024 May 31;26:e55714. doi: 10.2196/55714.,Weirauch V,J Med Internet Res,2024,2024/05/31,PMC11179021,,10.2196/55714,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs) have the potential to enable public end users, such as citizens and patients, to manage and improve their health. Although the number of available DHIs is increasing, examples of successfully established DHIs in public health systems are limited. To counteract the nonuse of DHIs, they should be comprehensively evaluated while integrating end users. Unfortunately, there is a wide variability and heterogeneity according to the approaches of evaluation, which creates a methodological challenge. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the current established processes for evaluating DHIs, including methods, indicators, and end-user involvement. The review is not limited to a specific medical field or type of DHI but offers a holistic overview. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted following the JBI methodology for scoping reviews based on the framework by Arksey & O'Malley and complies with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Three scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct) were searched in April 2023. English and German studies between 2008 and 2023 were considered when evaluating DHIs that explicitly address public end users. The process of study selection was carried out by several researchers to avoid reviewer bias. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 9618 publications, of which 160 were included. Among these included articles, 200 evaluations were derived and analyzed. The results showed that there is neither a consensus on the methods to evaluate DHIs nor a commonly agreed definition or usage of the evaluated indicators, which results in a broad variety of evaluation practices. This aligns with observations of the existing literature. It was found that there is a lack of references to existing frameworks for the evaluation of DHIs. The majority of the included studies referred to user-centered approaches and involved end users in the evaluation process. As assistance for people developing and evaluating DHIs and as a basis for thinking about appropriate ways to evaluate DHIs, a results matrix was created where the findings were combined per DHI cluster. Additionally, general recommendations for the evaluators of DHIs were formulated. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this scoping review offer a holistic overview of the variety and heterogeneity according to the approaches of evaluation of DHIs for public end users. Evaluators of these DHIs should be encouraged to reference established frameworks or measurements for justification. This would ease the transferability of the results among similar evaluation studies within the digital health sector, thereby enhancing the coherence and comparability of research in this area."
App Technology to Support Physical Activity and Intake of Vitamins and Minerals After Bariatric Surgery (the PromMera Study): Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,"Bonn SE, Hult M, Spetz K, Löf M, Andersson E, Wiren M, Trolle Lagerros Y.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Aug 14;9(8):e19624. doi: 10.2196/19624.,Bonn SE,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/08/16,PMC7455871,,10.2196/19624,"BACKGROUND: To optimize postoperative outcomes after bariatric surgery, lifestyle changes including increased physical activity are needed. Micronutrient deficiency after surgery is also common and daily supplementation is recommended. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the PromMera study is to evaluate the effects of a 12-week smartphone app intervention on promotion of physical activity (primary outcome) and adherence to postsurgery vitamin and mineral supplementation, as well as on other lifestyle factors and overall health in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: The PromMera study is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial comprising patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Participants are randomized postsurgery 1:1 to either the intervention group (ie, use of the PromMera app for 12 weeks) or the control group receiving only standard care. Clinical and lifestyle variables are assessed pre- and postsurgery after 18 weeks (postintervention assessment), 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. Assessments include body composition using Tanita or BOD POD analyzers, muscle function using handgrip, biomarkers in blood, and an extensive questionnaire on lifestyle factors. Physical activity is objectively measured using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT triaxial accelerometer. RESULTS: A total of 154 participants have been enrolled in the study. The last study participant was recruited in May 2019. Data collection will be complete in May 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing lifestyle changes are crucial after bariatric surgery and new ways to reach patients and support such changes are needed. An app-based intervention is easily delivered at any time and can be a key factor in the adoption of healthier behavioral patterns in this rapidly growing group of patients.

Are eHealth interventions for adults who are scheduled for or have undergone bariatric surgery as effective as usual care? A systematic review,"Wright C, Mutsekwa RN, Hamilton K, Campbell KL, Kelly J.",Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2021 Dec;17(12):2065-2080. doi: 10.1016/j.soard.2021.07.020. Epub 2021 Aug 3.,Wright C,Surg Obes Relat Dis,2021,2021/09/03,,,10.1016/j.soard.2021.07.020,"This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of eHealth-delivered interventions for adults who undergo bariatric surgery on postoperative weight loss, weight loss maintenance, eating psychopathology, quality of life, depression screening, and self-efficacy. Six electronic databases were searched, with 14 studies (across 17 reports) included, involving 1633 participants. With substantial heterogeneity, qualitative descriptions have been provided. Interventions were delivered via an online program or internet modules (n = 2), telephone (n = 2), text messages (n = 2), videoconferencing (n = 3), mobile application (n = 1), and audiovisual media (n = 1). Three studies included a combination, including internet modules and telephone (n = 1), wireless fidelity scales, emails, and telephone (n = 1), and a combination of online treatment, weekly emails, and access to a private Facebook group (n = 1). All the eHealth interventions, except for one, implemented behavior change techniques, including self-monitoring, problem solving, social support, goal setting, and shaping knowledge. Both eHealth intervention and control groups lost weight across the included studies, and eHealth was found to be as effective as or more effective than the control for weight loss. Two studies measured weight loss maintenance; both eHealth and control groups regained weight in the longer term. The interventions showed significant improvement on assessment measures for eating psychopathology. In conclusion, when bariatric surgery patients have limited or no access to healthcare teams or require additional support, eHealth may be a suitable option. Future studies implementing eHealth interventions would benefit from reporting intervention components as per the behavior change techniques taxonomy and further consideration of delivering eHealth in a stepped care approach would be beneficial."
Efficacy and Effectiveness of Mobile Health Technologies for Facilitating Physical Activity in Adolescents: Scoping Review,"Lee AM, Chavez S, Bian J, Thompson LA, Gurka MJ, Williamson VG, Modave F.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2019 Feb 12;7(2):e11847. doi: 10.2196/11847.,Lee AM,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2019,2019/02/13,PMC6390191,,10.2196/11847,"BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity (PA) levels in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years is associated with prevention of unhealthy weight gain and improvement in cardiovascular fitness. The widespread availability of mobile health (mHealth) and wearable devices offers self-monitoring and motivational features for increasing PA levels and improving adherence to exercise programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review was to identify the efficacy or effectiveness of mHealth intervention strategies for facilitating PA among adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for peer-reviewed studies published between 2008 and 2018 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychINFO, or SportDiscus. The search terms used included mHealth or ""mobile health"" or apps, ""physical activity"" or exercise, children or adolescents or teens or ""young adults"" or kids, and efficacy or effectiveness. Articles published outside of the date range (July 2008 to October 2018) and non-English articles were removed before abstract review. Three reviewers assessed all abstracts against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any uncertainties or differences in opinion were discussed as a group. The inclusion criteria were that the studies should (1) have an mHealth component, (2) target participants aged between 12 and 18 years, (3) have results on efficacy or effectiveness, and (4) assess PA-related outcomes. Reviews, abstracts only, protocols without results, and short message service text messaging-only interventions were excluded. We also extracted potentially relevant papers from reviews. At least 2 reviewers examined all full articles for fit with the criteria and extracted data for analysis. Data extracted from selected studies included study population, study type, components of PA intervention, and PA outcome results. RESULTS: Overall, 126 articles were initially identified. Reviewers pulled 18 additional articles from excluded review papers. Only 18 articles were passed onto full review, and 16 were kept for analysis. The included studies differed in the sizes of the study populations (11-607 participants), locations of the study sites (7 countries), study setting, and study design. Overall, 5 mHealth intervention categories were identified: website, website+wearable, app, wearable+app, and website+wearable+app. The most common measures reported were subjective weekly PA (4/13) and objective daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (5/13) of the 19 different PA outcomes assessed. Furthermore, 5 of 13 studies with a control or comparison group showed a significant improvement in PA outcomes between the intervention group and the control or comparison group. Of those 5 studies, 3 permitted isolation of mHealth intervention components in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: PA outcomes for adolescents improved over time through mHealth intervention use; however, the lack of consistency in chosen PA outcome measures, paucity of significant outcomes via between-group analyses, and the various study designs that prevent separating the effects of intervention components calls into question their true effect."

Available treatments often fail to support long-term recovery by failing to account for the dynamic nature of long-term recovery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this protocol paper is to describe research that aims to develop a highly contextualized lapse risk prediction model that forecasts the ongoing probability of lapse. METHODS: The participants will include 480 US adults in their first year of recovery from OUD. Participants will report lapses and provide data relevant to lapse risk for a year with a digital therapeutic smartphone app through both self-report and passive personal sensing methods (eg, cellular communications and geolocation). The lapse risk prediction model will be developed using contemporary rigorous machine learning methods that optimize prediction in new data. RESULTS: The National Institute of Drug Abuse funded this project (R01DA047315) on July 18, 2019 with a funding period from August 1, 2019 to June 30, 2024. The University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved this project on July 9, 2019. Pilot enrollment began on April 16, 2021. Full enrollment began in September 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The model that will be developed in this project could support long-term recovery from OUD-for example, by enabling just-in-time interventions within digital therapeutics.

Current Status and Future Directions of mHealth Interventions for Health System Strengthening in India: Systematic Review,"Bassi A, John O, Praveen D, Maulik PK, Panda R, Jha V.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2018 Oct 26;6(10):e11440. doi: 10.2196/11440.,Bassi A,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2018,2018/10/29,PMC6229512,,10.2196/11440,"BACKGROUND: With the exponential increase in mobile phone users in India, a large number of public health initiatives are leveraging information technology and mobile devices for health care delivery. Given the considerable financial and human resources being invested in these initiatives, it is important to ascertain their role in strengthening health care systems. OBJECTIVE: We undertook this review to identify the published mobile health (mHealth) or telemedicine initiatives in India in terms of their current role in health systems strengthening. The review classifies these initiatives based on the disease areas, geographical distribution, and target users and assesses the quality of the available literature. METHODS: A search of the literature was done to identify mHealth or telemedicine articles published between January 1997 and June 2017 from India. The electronic bibliographic databases and registries searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Joanna Briggs Institute Database, and Clinical Trial Registry of India. The World Health Organization health system building block framework was used to categorize the published initiatives as per their role in the health system. Quality assessment of the selected articles was done using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment and National Institutes of Health, US tools. RESULTS: The combined search strategies yielded 2150 citations out of which 318 articles were included (primary research articles=125; reviews and system architectural, case studies, and opinion articles=193). A sharp increase was seen after 2012, driven primarily by noncommunicable disease-focused articles. Majority of the primary studies had their sites in the south Indian states, with no published articles from Jammu and Kashmir and north-eastern parts of India. Service delivery was the primary focus of 57.6% (72/125) of the selected articles. A majority of these articles had their focus on 1 (36.0%, 45/125) or 2 (45.6%, 57/125) domains of health system, most frequently service delivery and health workforce. Initiatives commonly used client education as a tool for improving the health system. More than 91.2% (114/125) of the studies, which lacked a sample size justification, had used convenience sampling. Methodological rigor of the selected trials (n=11) was assessed to be poor as majority of the studies had a high risk for bias in at least 2 categories. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, mHealth initiatives are being increasingly tested to improve health care delivery in India. Our review highlights the poor quality of the current evidence base and an urgent need for focused research aimed at generating high-quality evidence on the efficacy, user acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions aimed toward health systems strengthening. A pragmatic approach would be to include an implementation research component into the existing and proposed digital health initiatives to support the generation of evidence for health systems strengthening on strategically important outcomes."
"The Efficacy of a Personalized mHealth Coaching Program During Pregnancy on Maternal Diet, Supplement Use, and Physical Activity: Protocol for a Parallel-Group Randomized Controlled Trial","Nuruddin R, Vadsaria K, Mohammed N, Sayani S.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Nov 16;10(11):e31611. doi: 10.2196/31611.,Nuruddin R,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/11/16,PMC8663618,,10.2196/31611,"BACKGROUND: Adequate intake of macro- and micronutrients and adoption of an active lifestyle during pregnancy are essential for optimum maternal and fetal health and offspring development. Dietary counseling and advice regarding adequate physical activity are integral components of antenatal care. Personalized coaching through the use of mobile health (mHealth) that supports behavior modification is an innovative approach that needs exploration. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim is to assess the efficacy of an mHealth program in improving diet, supplement use, and physical activity during pregnancy. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the program's effect on maternal and offspring health outcomes and assessment of its compliance and usability. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was initiated at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, in January 2020. We aim to recruit 300 pregnant women in their first trimester who have smartphones, do not have comorbidities, and are not taking medications. The intervention group will be trained to use an mHealth app called PurUmeed Aaghaz. Through this app, the subjects will report information about their diet, supplement use, and physical activity and will receive personalized advice and three push messages as weekly reminders. The research assistant will obtain similar information from the control group via a paperless questionnaire; this group will receive standard face-to-face counseling regarding diet, supplement use, and physical activity. Data will be collected at enrollment and during four follow-up sessions scheduled 6 weeks apart. Primary study outcomes include improvements in diet (ie, change in mean dietary risk score from baseline to each follow-up), supplement use (ie, changes in mean supplement use score and biochemical levels of folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D on a study subset), and mean duration of reported physical activity (minutes). Secondary study outcomes relate to maternal health (ie, gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and gestational weight gain), newborn health (ie, birth weight and length and gestational age at delivery), and infant health (ie, BMI and blood pressure at 1 year of age). Compliance will be determined by the proportion of participants who complete the 6-month coaching program. Usability will be assessed based on features related to design, interface, content, coaching, perception, and personal benefit. RESULTS: The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the Aga Khan University in 2017. The recruitment of study participants was completed in September 2021. All follow-ups and outcome assessments are expected to be completed by March 2023 and analysis is expected to be completed by June 2023. We expect the results to be published by the end of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This study will be an important step toward evaluating the role of mHealth in improving behaviors related to a healthy diet, supplement use, and promotion of physical activity during pregnancy, as well as in influencing maternal and offspring outcomes. If proven effective, mHealth interventions can be scaled up and included in antenatal care packages at tertiary care hospitals of low- and middle-income countries.

"Mobile Health Interventions for Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Sleep in Adults Aged 50 Years and Older: A Systematic Literature Review","Elavsky S, Knapova L, Klocek A, Smahel D.",J Aging Phys Act. 2019 Aug 1;27(4):565-593. doi: 10.1123/japa.2017-0410.,Elavsky S,J Aging Phys Act,2019,2018/12/04,,,10.1123/japa.2017-0410,"We provide a systematic review of interventions utilizing mobile technology to alter physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep among adults aged 50 years and older. A systematic search identified 52 relevant articles (randomized control trial [RCT], quasi-experimental, pre/post single-group design). Of 50 trials assessing physical activity, 17 out of 29 RCTs and 13 out of 21 trials assessed for pre/post changes only supported the effectiveness of mobile interventions to improve physical activity, and 9 studies (five out of 10 RCTs and all four pre/post studies) out of 14 reduced sedentary behavior. Only two of five interventions improved sleep (one out of two RCTs and one out of three pre/post studies). Text messaging was the most frequently used intervention (60% of all studies) but was usually used in combination with other components (79% of hybrid interventions included SMS, plus either web or app components). Although more high-quality RCTs are needed, there is evidence supporting the effectiveness of mHealth approaches in those aged 50 years and older."
Optimization of a Transdiagnostic Mobile Emotion Regulation Intervention for University Students: Protocol for a Microrandomized Trial,"Laure T, Engels RCME, Remmerswaal D, Spruijt-Metz D, Konigorski S, Boffo M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Oct 27;12:e46603. doi: 10.2196/46603.,Laure T,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/10/27,PMC10638637,,10.2196/46603,"BACKGROUND: Many university students experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. To support their mental health, a transdiagnostic mobile app intervention has been developed. The intervention provides short exercises rooted in various approaches (eg, positive psychology, mindfulness, self-compassion, and acceptance and commitment therapy) that aim to facilitate adaptive emotion regulation (ER) to help students cope with the various stressors they encounter during their time at university. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study are to investigate whether the intervention and its components function as intended and how participants engage with them. In addition, this study aims to monitor changes in distress symptoms and ER skills and identify relevant contextual factors that may moderate the intervention's impact. METHODS: A sequential explanatory mixed methods design combining a microrandomized trial and semistructured interviews will be used. During the microrandomized trial, students (N=200) will be prompted via the mobile app twice a day for 3 weeks to evaluate their emotional states and complete a randomly assigned intervention (ie, an exercise supporting ER) or a control intervention (ie, a health information snippet). A subsample of participants (21/200, 10.5%) will participate in interviews exploring their user experience with the app and the completed exercises. The primary outcomes will be changes in emotional states and engagement with the intervention (ie, objective and subjective engagement). Objective engagement will be evaluated through log data (eg, exercise completion time). Subjective engagement will be evaluated through exercise likability and helpfulness ratings as well as user experience interviews. The secondary outcomes will include the distal outcomes of the intervention (ie, ER skills and distress symptoms). Finally, the contextual moderators of intervention effectiveness will be explored (eg, the time of day and momentary emotional states). RESULTS: The study commenced on February 9, 2023, and the data collection was concluded on June 13, 2023. Of the 172 eligible participants, 161 (93.6%) decided to participate. Of these 161 participants, 137 (85.1%) completed the first phase of the study. A subsample of participants (18/172, 10.5%) participated in the user experience interviews. Currently, the data processing and analyses are being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide insight into the functioning of the intervention and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the findings will shed light on potential changes in the distal outcomes of the intervention (ie, ER skills and distress symptoms), which will be considered when designing a follow-up randomized controlled trial evaluating the full-scale effectiveness of this intervention. Finally, the results and data gathered will be used to design and train a recommendation algorithm that will be integrated into the app linking students to relevant content.

Evaluating Barriers and Facilitators to the Uptake of mHealth Apps in Cancer Care Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research: Scoping Literature Review,"Ardito V, Golubev G, Ciani O, Tarricone R.",JMIR Cancer. 2023 Mar 30;9:e42092. doi: 10.2196/42092.,Ardito V,JMIR Cancer,2023,2023/03/30,PMC10131717,,10.2196/42092,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) solutions have proven to be effective in a wide range of patient outcomes and have proliferated over time. However, a persistent challenge of digital health technologies, including mHealth, is that they are characterized by early dropouts in clinical practice and struggle to be used outside experimental settings or on larger scales. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore barriers and enablers to the uptake of mHealth solutions used by patients with cancer undergoing treatment, using a theory-guided implementation science model, that is, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). METHODS: A scoping literature review was conducted using PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases in March 2022. We selected studies that analyzed the development, evaluation, and implementation of mHealth solutions for patients with cancer that were used in addition to the standard of care. Only empirical designs (eg, randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and qualitative studies) were considered. First, information on the study characteristics, patient population, app functionalities, and study outcomes was extracted. Then, the CFIR model was used as a practical tool to guide data collection and interpretation of evidence on mHealth uptake. RESULTS: Overall, 91 papers were included in the data synthesis. The selected records were mostly randomized controlled trials (26/91, 29%) and single-arm, noncomparative studies (52/91, 57%). Most of the apps (42/73, 58%) were designed for both patients and clinicians and could be used to support any type of cancer (29/73, 40%) and a range of oncological treatments. Following the CFIR scheme (intervention, outer setting, inner setting, individuals, process), multistakeholder co-design, codevelopment, and testing of mHealth interventions were identified as key enablers for later uptake. A variety of external drivers emerged, although the most relevant outer incentive fostering mHealth use was addressing patient needs. Among organizational factors likely to influence technology uptake, interoperability was the most prominent, whereas other providers' dimensions such as managerial attitudes or organizational culture were not systematically discussed. Technology-related impediments that could hamper the use of mHealth at the individual level were considered least often. CONCLUSIONS: The hype surrounding mHealth in cancer care is hindered by several factors that can affect its use in real world and nonexperimental settings. Compared with the growing evidence on mHealth efficacy, knowledge to inform the uptake of mHealth solutions in clinical cancer care is still scarce. Although some of our findings are supported by previous implementation research, our analysis elaborates on the distinguishing features of mHealth apps and provides an integrated perspective on the factors that should be accounted for implementation efforts. Future syntheses should liaise these dimensions with strategies observed in successful implementation initiatives."

This critical review aims to outline and review novel behaviour change frameworks that guide digital health intervention development. Our comprehensive search for preprints and publications used PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and the Open Science Framework repository. Articles were included if they: (1) were peer-reviewed; (2) proposed a behaviour change framework to guide digital health intervention development; (3) were written in English; (4) were published between 1/1/19 and 1/8/2021; and (5) were applicable to chronic diseases. Intervention development frameworks considered the user, intervention elements and theoretical foundations. However, the timing and policy of interventions are not consistently addressed across frameworks. Researchers should deeply consider the digital applicability of behaviour change frameworks to improve intervention success."
Effect of mHealth Interventions on Glycemic Control and HbA1c Improvement among Type II Diabetes Patients in Asian Population: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Verma D, Bahurupi Y, Kant R, Singh M, Aggarwal P, Saxena V.",Indian J Endocrinol Metab. 2021 Nov-Dec;25(6):484-492. doi: 10.4103/ijem.ijem_387_21. Epub 2022 Feb 17.,Verma D,Indian J Endocrinol Metab,2021,2022/03/31,PMC8959192,,10.4103/ijem.ijem_387_21,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, it is pertinent to educate and inform diabetes patients about their self-management. It can be done effectively using innovative methods like mobile health (mHealth), which includes mobile applications, phone calls, and text messages. Thus, this meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for the management of diabetes compared with usual care in the Asian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches were performed in electronic databases, namely PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library, in August and September 2020. Search terms used were ""Diabetes Mellitus,"" ""mHealth,"" ""glycemic control"", ""HbA1c levels,"" and ""Blood glucose levels."" The primary outcome was glycated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels. Trials were pooled, and heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: The search yielded 3980 abstracts, of which 18 trials met the inclusion criteria. Lowering of Hba1c levels was reported in the majority of trials, which aided in Glycemic control. For post prandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels, a statistically significant reduction of value -20.13 (95%CI -35.16 to -5.10, P = 0.009, I(2) = 59%) was seen in the mean in the intervention group, whereas for HbA1c levels the mean reduction in the intervention group was -0.44 (95%CI, -0.79 to 0.10, P = 0.01, I(2) = 87%). Although these interventions proved beneficial for these outcomes, there was a difference in the amount of effects caused by different mHealth interventions. CONCLUSION: This study acknowledged the effects of different mHealth interventions as per their accessibility and availability in recent years. There is a need to include more studies in future reviews to generate a larger body of evidence for the reported outcomes. The researchers should give the utmost priority to the transparency while reporting the interventions for effective interpretation of the retrieved data."

This approach can be used to deliver supportive feedback at critical moments to optimize the attainment of health behavior goals. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this systematic review were to summarize data on the content characteristics of feedback messaging used in diet and physical activity (PA) interventions and to develop a practical framework for designing just-in-time feedback for behavioral interventions. METHODS: Interventions that included just-in-time feedback on PA, sedentary behavior, or dietary intake were eligible for inclusion. Feedback content and efficacy data were synthesized descriptively. RESULTS: The review included 31 studies (15/31, 48%, targeting PA or sedentary behavior only; 13/31, 42%, targeting diet and PA; and 3/31, 10%, targeting diet only). All studies used just-in-time feedback, 30 (97%, 30/31) used personalized feedback, and 24 (78%, 24/31) used goal-oriented feedback, but only 5 (16%, 5/31) used actionable feedback. Of the 9 studies that tested the efficacy of providing feedback to promote behavior change, 4 reported significant improvements in health behavior. In 3 of these 4 studies, feedback was continuously available, goal-oriented, or actionable. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback that was continuously available, personalized, and actionable relative to a known behavioral objective was prominent in intervention studies with significant behavior change outcomes. Future research should determine whether all or some of these characteristics are needed to optimize the effect of feedback in just-in-time interventions."

METHODS: The study setting will be the Department of Geriatrics at Gia Dinh People's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Inclusion criteria will be the family caregivers of people with dementia living in the community, who attend the Department and use smartphones. In phase 1, we will identify the intervention content with family caregivers of people with dementia through 20 in-depth interviews to determine what information and skills they need. In phase 2, a pilot randomized control trial design will be conducted, with 60 family caregivers of people with dementia being assigned to the intervention or control group by the block randomization method with a ratio of 1:1. The intervention will include weekly, online, psycho-educational, group sessions hosted on the Zalo app. The participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 3-month postintervention. The feasibility of the intervention and methodology will be assessed, including the rates of recruitment, retention, completion of assessments, and acceptability of the intervention. RESULTS: The required information and skills in phase 1 may include dealing with worrying behavior changes in people with dementia, emotional support, and seeking support sources. The rates of recruitment, retention, completion of assessments, and acceptability of the intervention will be obtained in phase 2. The scores of symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety in the intervention group may be lower than those in the control group at postintervention and 3-month postintervention. CONCLUSION: The study will provide a foundation for a fully powered clinical trial for the smartphone app-based intervention to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety among family caregivers of people with dementia in Vietnam."
A Smartphone App-Based Mindfulness Intervention for Cancer Survivors: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Subnis UB, Farb NA, Piedalue KL, Speca M, Lupichuk S, Tang PA, Faris P, Thoburn M, Saab BJ, Carlson LE.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 May 11;9(5):e15178. doi: 10.2196/15178.,Subnis UB,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/05/12,PMC7248798,,10.2196/15178,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients transitioning to survivorship after completing cancer treatments need psychosocial interventions to manage stressors such as anxiety, depression, and fear of cancer recurrence. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are effective for treating these symptoms; however, cancer survivors are often unable to participate in face-to-face interventions because of difficulties such as work and family commitments, treatment-related side-effects, scheduling conflicts, and geography. Smartphone app-based MBIs are an innovative way to deliver psychosocial cancer care and can overcome several such difficulties, since patients can participate at their own convenience. OBJECTIVE: The SEAMLESS (Smartphone App-Based Mindfulness Intervention for Cancer Survivors) study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a tailored app-based mindfulness intervention for cancer survivors (the Am Mindfulness-Based Cancer Survivorship-MBCS-Journey) for treating (1) symptoms of stress (primary outcome), as well as (2) fear of cancer recurrence, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and overall physical functioning (secondary outcomes). This is the first Canadian efficacy trial of a tailored mindfulness app intervention in cancer survivors. METHODS: This is a randomized waitlist-controlled trial, which will evaluate the effectiveness of Am MBCS for impacting the primary and secondary outcomes in cancer survivors who have completed all their cancer treatments. Outcomes will be assessed using web-based surveys with validated psychometric instruments at (1) baseline, (2) mid-intervention (2 weeks later), (3) immediately postintervention (4 weeks), (4) 3 months postbaseline, (5) 6 months postbaseline, and (6) 12 months postbaseline. The waitlist group will complete all assessments and will cross over to the intervention condition after the 3-month assessment. In addition, data will be obtained by the smartphone app itself, which includes users' engagement with the app-based intervention, their emotional state (eg, angry and elated) from a user-inputted digital emotion-mapping board, and psychobiometric data using photoplethysmography technology. RESULTS: The study received ethics approval in September 2018 and recruitment commenced in January 2019. Participants are being recruited through a provincial cancer registry, and the majority of participants currently enrolled are breast (44/83, 53%) or colorectal (17/83, 20%) cancer survivors, although some survivors of other cancer are also present. Data collection for analysis of the primary outcome time-point will be complete by September 2019, and the follow-up data will be collected and analyzed by September 2020. Data will be analyzed to determine group differences using linear mixed modelling statistical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer care providers are uncertain about the efficacy of app-based mindfulness interventions for patients, which are available in great supply in today's digital world. This study will provide rigorously evaluated efficacy data for an app-based mindfulness intervention for cancer survivors, which if helpful, could be made available for psychosocial care at cancer centers worldwide.

Development of the key performance indicators for digital health interventions: A scoping review,"Brenner M, Weir A, McCann M, Doyle C, Hughes M, Moen A, Ingvar M, Nauwelaerts K, Turk E, McCabe C.",Digit Health. 2023 Jan 22;9:20552076231152160. doi: 10.1177/20552076231152160. eCollection 2023 Jan-Dec.,Brenner M,Digit Health,2023,2023/01/30,PMC9880566,,10.1177/20552076231152160,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions offer new methods for delivering healthcare, with the potential to innovate healthcare services. Key performance indicators play a role in the evaluation, measurement, and improvement in healthcare quality and service performance. The aim of this scoping review was to identify current knowledge and evidence surrounding the development of key performance indicators for digital health interventions. METHODS: A literature search was conducted across ten key databases: AMED - The Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL - Complete, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, EMBASE, EBM Reviews - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EBM Reviews - Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, EBM Reviews - Health Technology Assessment, and IEEE Xplore. RESULTS: Five references were eligible for the review. Two were articles on original research studies of a specific digital health intervention, and two were overviews of methods for developing digital health interventions (not specific to a single digital health intervention). All the included reports discussed the involvement of stakeholders in developing key performance indicators for digital health interventions. The step of identifying and defining the key performance indicators was completed using various methodologies, but all centred on a form of stakeholder involvement. Potential options for stakeholder involvement for key performance indicator identification include the use of an elicitation framework, a factorial survey approach, or a Delphi study. CONCLUSIONS: Few articles were identified, highlighting a significant gap in evidence-based knowledge in this domain. All the included articles discussed the involvement of stakeholders in developing key performance indicators for digital health interventions, which were performed using various methodologies. The articles acknowledged a lack of literature related to key performance indicator development for digital health interventions. To allow comparability between key performance indicator initiatives and facilitate work in the field, further research would be beneficial to develop a common methodology for key performance indicators development for digital health interventions."

Recent systematic reviews concluded that app and web-based interventions can improve lifestyle behaviors and weight loss at a reasonable cost, but long-term sustainability needs to be demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: This study protocol is for a 2-year randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the clinical and economic effects of a primary care, anchored, collaborative, electronic health (eHealth) lifestyle coaching program (long-term Lifestyle change InterVention and eHealth Application [LIVA] 2.0) in obese participants with and without type 2 diabetes. The program's primary outcome is weight loss. Its secondary outcome is the hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) level, and its tertiary outcomes are retention rate, quality of life (QOL), and cost effectiveness. Analytically, the focus is on associations of participant characteristics with outcomes and sustainability. METHODS: We conduct a multicenter trial with a 1-year intervention and 1-year retention. LIVA 2.0 is implemented in municipalities within administrative regions in Denmark, specifically eight municipalities located within the Region of Southern Denmark and two municipalities located within the Capital Region of Denmark. The participants are assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. Individual data from the LIVA 2.0 platform are combined with clinical measurements, questionnaires, and participants' usage of municipality and health care services. The participants have a BMI >/=30 but </=45 kg/m2, and 50% of the participants have type 2 diabetes. The participants are randomized in an approximately 60:40 manner, and based on sample size calculations on weight loss and intention-to-treat statistics, 200 participants are randomized to an intervention group and 140 are randomized to a control group. The control group is offered the conventional preventive program of the municipality, and it is compared to the intervention group, which follows the LIVA 2.0 in addition to the conventional preventive program. RESULTS: The first baseline assessments have been carried out in March 2018, and the 2-year follow-up will be carried out between March 2020 and April 2021. The hypothesis is that the trial results will demonstrate decreased body weight and that the number of patients who show normalization of their HbA(1c) levels in the intervention group will be much higher than that in the control group. The participants in the intervention group are also expected to show a greater decrease in their use of glucose-lowering medication and a greater improvement in their QOL when compared with the control group. Operational costs are expected to be lower than standard care, and the intervention is expected to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time that an app and web-based eHealth lifestyle coaching program implemented in Danish municipalities will be clinically and economically evaluated. If the LIVA 2.0 eHealth lifestyle coaching program is proven to be effective, there is great potential for decreasing the rates of obesity, diabetes, and related chronic diseases.

Epub 2019 Nov 15.,Stogios N,Can J Cardiol,2020,2020/04/07,,,10.1016/j.cjca.2019.11.010,"BACKGROUND: Behavioural counselling via internet- or mobile-based digital platforms is recommended for hypertension; however, outcome heterogeneity is problematic in trials of this digital intervention. Our objective was to assess how therapeutic outcome was optimized in digital trials for hypertension, according to key features of the intervention design and protocol. METHODS: We identified randomized controlled digital trials for systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction in taskforce guideline and policy statements, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses published since 2010, by searching the EMBASE, Cochrane Library, psycINFO, and PubMed databases. This search was updated to January 2019. Trials included patients with elevated cardiovascular risk or cardiovascular disease. We classified digital trials by the number of components of the intervention, and whether the protocol was organized by an explicit model of behavioural change or counselling. The influence of these features was evaluated for treatment efficacy and heterogeneity of SBP outcomes. RESULTS: Seventeen trials met inclusion criteria: pooled n = 5780, 33% female, 93% taking antihypertensive medications. SBP reduction was -7.3 mm Hg for digital counselling (95% confidence interval: -7.0 to -7.5) vs -3.6 mm Hg for control (95% confidence interval: -3.4 to -3.9), P < 0.0001, with high-moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 67%). Trials with multiple behavioural intervention components and an organized theoretical framework of behaviour change or counselling demonstrated optimal SBP reduction with low-moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 49%). CONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions optimize the efficacy of medical therapy for SBP reduction. There is opportunity to promote a disruptive change in clinical science that accompanies technological developments in digital health promotion."
Improving Engagement Among Patients With Chronic Cardiometabolic Conditions Using mHealth: Critical Review of Reviews,"Cheikh-Moussa K, Mira JJ, Orozco-Beltran D.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Apr 8;8(4):e15446. doi: 10.2196/15446.,Cheikh-Moussa K,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/04/09,PMC7177429,,10.2196/15446,"BACKGROUND: The burden imposed by cardiometabolic diseases remains a principal health care system concern. Integration of mobile health (mHealth) interventions is helpful for telemonitoring of these patients, which enables patients to be more active and take part in their treatment, while being more conscious and gaining more control over the outcomes. However, little is known about the degree to which users engage, and the extent to which this interaction matches the usage pattern for which mHealth interventions were designed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and results of studies on mHealth solutions that measured the effects of interventions with patient engagement in the context of chronic cardiometabolic diseases. METHODS: A critical review of systematic reviews was conducted to recover data on interventions focused on the engagement of patients with chronic cardiometabolic diseases using mHealth technologies. Articles (from January 1, 2010) were searched in the Medlars Online International Literature Medline (Medline/Pubmed), Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Scielo databases. Only studies that quantified a measure of engagement by patients with cardiometabolic disease were included for analysis. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) was used to determine included studies considering the quality of the data provided. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklist was used to assess the quality of the evidence according to the methodology used in the studies reviewed. Engagement was defined as the level of patient implication or participation in self-care interventions. Engagement measures included number of logs to the website or platform, frequency of usage, number of messages exchanged, and number of tasks completed. RESULTS: Initially, 638 papers were retrieved after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, only three systematic reviews measuring engagement were included in the analysis. No reviews applying a meta-analysis approach were found. The three review articles described the results of 10 clinical trials and feasibility studies that quantified engagement and met the inclusion criteria assessed through CASP. The sample size varied between 6 and 270 individuals, who were predominantly men. Cardiac disease was the principal target in the comparison of traditional and mHealth interventions for engagement improvement. The level of patient engagement with mHealth technologies varied between 50% and 97%, and technologies incorporating smartphones with a reminder function resulted in the highest level of engagement. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth interventions are an effective solution for improving engagement of patients with chronic cardiometabolic diseases. However, there is a need for advanced analysis and higher-quality studies focused on long-term engagement with specific interventions.

However, a key challenge is the development of digital interventions that are acceptable to end users. Co-production with providers and stakeholders is increasingly positioned as the gold standard for improving uptake, engagement, and healthcare outcomes. Nevertheless, clear guidance around the process of co-production is lacking. The objectives of this review were to: (i) present an overview of the methods and approaches to co-production when designing, producing, and evaluating digital mental health interventions; and (ii) explore the barriers and facilitators affecting co-production in this context. METHODS: A pre-registered (CRD42023414007) systematic review was completed in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Five databases were searched. A co-produced bespoke quality appraisal tool was developed with an expert by experience to assess the quality of the co-production methods and approaches. A narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies across 24 digital mental health interventions met inclusion criteria. App interventions were rarely co-produced with end users throughout all stages of design, development, and evaluation. Co-producing digital mental health interventions added value by creating culturally sensitive and acceptable interventions. Reported challenges included resource issues exacerbated by the digital nature of the intervention, variability across stakeholder suggestions, and power imbalances between stakeholders and researchers. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in approaches to co-producing digital mental health interventions is evident, with inconsistencies between stakeholder groups involved, stage of involvement, stakeholders' roles and methods employed."
Effectiveness of Digital Health Literacy Interventions in Older Adults: Single-Arm Meta-Analysis,"Dong Q, Liu T, Liu R, Yang H, Liu C.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Jun 28;25:e48166. doi: 10.2196/48166.,Dong Q,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/06/28,PMC10365623,,10.2196/48166,"BACKGROUND: In a world of rapid digital technology development, the lack of digital health literacy (DHL) among older people cannot be ignored. DHL is becoming an essential competency that can facilitate the health status and health management of older adults. DHL interventions that are feasible and appropriate can be implemented on a large scale through the health care system for older people. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of DHL interventions for older adults. METHODS: English publications in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 20, 2022. Two reviewers independently completed the data extraction and quality assessment. Review Manager (version 5.4; Cochrane Informatics & Technology Services) software was used for all meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies, including 2 randomized controlled trials and 5 quasi-experimental studies, involving 710 older adults were considered eligible. The main outcome was scores on the eHealth Literacy Scale, and secondary outcomes were knowledge, self-efficacy, and skills. Quasi-experimental studies compared baseline and postintervention outcomes, while randomized controlled trials compared pre- and postintervention outcomes in the intervention group. Of the 7 studies, 3 used face-to-face instruction, while 4 adopted web-based interventions. Among them, 4 of the interventions were conducted using theoretical guidance, while 3 were not. Intervention duration varied from 2 to 8 weeks. In addition, the studies included were all conducted in developed countries, mainly in the United States. Pooled analysis presented that DHL interventions had positive effects on eHealth literacy efficacy (standardized mean difference 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that DHL interventions that chose face-to-face teaching (standardized mean difference 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001), were guided by a conceptual framework (standardized mean difference 1.15, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001), and were sustained over 4 weeks (standardized mean difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.84; P=.001) had a more significant effect. Moreover, the outcomes showed considerable gains in knowledge (standardized mean difference 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; P<.001) and self-efficacy (standardized mean difference 0.96, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.77; P=.02). No statistically significant effect was found for skills (standardized mean difference 0.77, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.85; P=.16). The small number of studies, variable study quality, and heterogeneity are some limitations of this review. CONCLUSIONS: DHL interventions have positive effects on the health status and health management of older adults. Practical and effective DHL interventions are crucial for the use of modern digital information technology in managing the health of older people.

Effectiveness of a personalized digital exercise and nutrition-based rehab program for patients with gastric cancer after surgery: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Kim I, Lim JY, Kim JK, Lee JH, Sohn TS, Park S, Kang SH, Lee JY, Hwang JH.",Digit Health. 2023 Jul 17;9:20552076231187602. doi: 10.1177/20552076231187602. eCollection 2023 Jan-Dec.,Kim I,Digit Health,2023,2023/07/24,PMC10357057,,10.1177/20552076231187602,"BACKGROUND: Patients with gastric cancer often encounter impaired quality of life and reduced tolerability to adjuvant treatments after surgery. Weight preservation is crucial for the overall prognosis of these patients, and exercise and supplemental nutrition play the main role. This study is the first randomized clinical trial to apply personalized, treatment stage-adjusted digital intervention with wearable devices in gastric cancer rehabilitation intervention for 12 months, commencing immediately after surgery. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter, two-armed, randomized controlled trial and aims to recruit 324 patients from two hospitals. Patients will be randomly allocated to two groups for 1 year of rehabilitation, starting immediately after the operation: a personalized digital therapeutic (intervention) group and a conventional education-based rehabilitation (control) group. The primary objective is to clarify the effect of mobile applications and wearable smart bands in reducing weight loss in patients with gastric cancer. The secondary outcomes are quality of life measured by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and STO22; nutritional status by mini nutrition assessment; physical fitness level measured by grip strength test, 30-s chair stand test and 2-min walk test; physical activity measured by IPAQ-SF; pain intensity; skeletal muscle mass; and fat mass. These measurements will be performed on enrollment and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: Digital therapeutic programs include exercise and nutritional interventions modified by age, body mass index, surgery type and postoperative days. Thus, expert intervention is pivotal for precise and safe calibration of this program.

People who relapse often exhibit changes (early warning signs [EWS]) in the period before relapse. Successful identification of EWS offers an opportunity for relapse prevention. However, several known barriers impede the use of EWS monitoring approaches. Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER) is a complex digital intervention that uses a mobile app to enhance the detection and management of self-reported changes in well-being. This is currently being tested in a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial. As digital interventions have not been widely used in relapse prevention, little is known about their implementation. Process evaluation studies run in parallel to clinical trials can provide valuable data on intervention feasibility. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to transparently describe the protocol for the process evaluation element of the EMPOWER trial. We will focus on the development of a process evaluation framework sensitive to the worldview of service users, mental health staff, and carers; the aims of the process evaluation itself; the proposed studies to address these aims; and a plan for integration of results from separate process evaluation studies into one overall report. METHODS: The overall process evaluation will utilize mixed methods across 6 substudies. Among them, 4 will use qualitative methodologies, 1 will use a mixed methods approach, and 1 will use quantitative methodologies. RESULTS: The results of all studies will be triangulated into an overall analysis and interpretation of key implementation lessons. EMPOWER was funded in 2016, recruitment finished in January 2018. Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in December 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study will help identify implementation facilitators and barriers to EMPOWER. These insights will inform both upscaling decisions and optimization of a definitive trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN99559262; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN99559262.

An internet-based adolescent depression preventive intervention: study protocol for a randomized control trial,"Gladstone TG, Marko-Holguin M, Rothberg P, Nidetz J, Diehl A, DeFrino DT, Harris M, Ching E, Eder M, Canel J, Bell C, Beardslee WR, Brown CH, Griffiths K, Van Voorhees BW.",Trials. 2015 May 1;16:203. doi: 10.1186/s13063-015-0705-2.,Gladstone TG,Trials,2015,2015/05/01,PMC4418055,,10.1186/s13063-015-0705-2,"BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of major depressive disorder in adolescents and the low rate of successful treatment highlight a pressing need for accessible, affordable adolescent depression prevention programs. The Internet offers opportunities to provide adolescents with high quality, evidence-based programs without burdening or creating new care delivery systems. Internet-based interventions hold promise, but further research is needed to explore the efficacy of these approaches and ways of integrating emerging technologies for behavioral health into the primary care system. METHODS/DESIGN: We developed a primary care Internet-based depression prevention intervention, Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), to evaluate a self-guided, online approach to depression prevention and are conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing CATCH-IT to a general health education Internet intervention. This article documents the research framework and randomized clinical trial design used to evaluate CATCH-IT for adolescents, in order to inform future work in Internet-based adolescent prevention programs. The rationale for this trial is introduced, the current status of the study is reviewed, and potential implications and future directions are discussed. DISCUSSION: The current protocol represents the only current, systematic approach to connecting at-risk youth with self-directed depression prevention programs in a medical setting. This trial undertakes the complex public health task of identifying at-risk individuals through mass screening of the general primary care population, rather than solely relying on volunteers recruited over the Internet, and the trial design provides measures of both symptomatic and diagnostic clinical outcomes. At the present time, we have enrolled N = 234 adolescents/expected 400 and N = 186 parents/expected 400 in this trial, from N = 6 major health systems. The protocol described here provides a model for a new generation of interventions that blend substantial computer-based instruction with human contact to intervene to prevent mental disorders such as depression. Because of the potential for broad generalizability of this model, the results of this study are important, as they will help develop the guidelines for preventive interventions with youth at-risk for the development of depressive and other mental disorders.

Digital Interventions on Healthy Lifestyle Management: Systematic Review,"Chatterjee A, Prinz A, Gerdes M, Martinez S.",J Med Internet Res. 2021 Nov 17;23(11):e26931. doi: 10.2196/26931.,Chatterjee A,J Med Internet Res,2021,2021/11/17,PMC8663673,,10.2196/26931,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions have tremendous potential to improve well-being and health care conveyance by improving adequacy, proficiency, availability, and personalization. They have gained acknowledgment in interventions for the management of a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, we are reviewing existing conceptual frameworks, digital intervention approaches, and associated methods to identify the impact of digital intervention on adopting a healthier lifestyle. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact of digital interventions on weight management in maintaining a healthy lifestyle (eg, regular physical activity, healthy habits, and proper dietary patterns). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to search the scientific databases (Nature, SpringerLink, Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed) that included digital interventions on healthy lifestyle, focusing on preventing obesity and being overweight as a prime objective. Peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2020 were included. We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and a framework for an evidence-based systematic review. Furthermore, we improved the review process by adopting the Rayyan tool and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. RESULTS: Our initial searches identified 780 potential studies through electronic and manual searches; however, 107 articles in the final stage were cited following the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The identified methods for a successful digital intervention to promote a healthy lifestyle are self-monitoring, self-motivation, goal setting, personalized feedback, participant engagement, psychological empowerment, persuasion, digital literacy, efficacy, and credibility. In this study, we identified existing conceptual frameworks for digital interventions, different approaches to provide digital interventions, associated methods, and execution challenges and their impact on the promotion of healthy lifestyle management. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review selected intervention principles (rules), theories, design features, ways to determine efficient interventions, and weaknesses in healthy lifestyle management from established digital intervention approaches. The results help us understand how digital interventions influence lifestyle management and overcome the existing shortcomings. It serves as a basis for further research with a focus on designing, developing, testing, and evaluating the generation of personalized lifestyle recommendations as a part of digital health interventions."

Mixed-methods approach to evaluate an mHealth intervention to increase adherence to triage of human papillomavirus-positive women who have performed self-collection (the ATICA study): study protocol for a hybrid type I cluster randomized effectiveness-implementation trial,"Arrossi S, Paolino M, Orellana L, Thouyaret L, Kohler RE, Viswanath K.",Trials. 2019 Feb 26;20(1):148. doi: 10.1186/s13063-019-3229-3.,Arrossi S,Trials,2019,2019/02/28,PMC6390557,,10.1186/s13063-019-3229-3,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women worldwide, with more than 85% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Human papillomavirus (HPV) screening allows for self-collection with the potential to increase coverage, but still requires triage to identify which HPV+ women need diagnostic and treatment procedures. However, achieving high levels of triage adherence can be challenging, especially among socially vulnerable women. This paper describes the ATICA protocol (Application of Communication and Information Technologies to Self-Collection, for its initials in Spanish), aimed at evaluating the implementation strategy and the effectiveness of a multi-component mobile health (mHealth) intervention to increase adherence to triage among women with HPV+ self-collected tests. METHODS: We will use an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial with a mixed-methods evaluation approach. A cluster randomized trial design including 200 community health workers (CHWs) will evaluate whether the mHealth intervention increases adherence to triage among HPV+ women who self-collected at home during a CHW visit within 120 days after a positive result. The intervention includes an initial mobile phone text message (SMS) alert and subsequent reminders sent to HPV+ women. For those who do not adhere to triage within 60 days of a positive HPV test, an email and SMS will be sent to the CHWs to promote contact with these women during home visits. We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as an organizing and analytic framework to evaluate the implementation of the intervention while also drawing on Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM). We will conduct a self-administered, semi-structured survey of CHWs, semi-structured interviews with local health authorities, and a survey of HPV+ women. Combining both qualitative and quantitative data will provide rich insights into local implementation challenges and successes. DISCUSSION: Findings from the implementation evaluation will be applicable to programs that use or are planning to incorporate HPV self-collection and/or mHealth interventions in different settings and countries. This innovative study will also serve as a model for using implementation science in the region. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03478397 . Registered on 20 March 2018."

Owing to accessibility, affordability, and scalability, an increasing number of digital health interventions (DHIs) have been developed and incorporated into MH treatment. Studies have shown the potential of DHIs to improve MH outcomes. However, the modes of delivery used to engage CYP in digital MH interventions may differ, with implications for the extent to which findings pertain to the level of engagement with the DHI. Knowledge of the various modalities could aid in the development of interventions that are acceptable and feasible. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to (1) identify modes of delivery used in CYP digital MH interventions, (2) explore influencing factors to usage and implementation, and (3) investigate ways in which the interventions have been evaluated and whether CYP engage in DHIs. METHODS: A literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and PsycINFO databases using 3 key concepts ""child and adolescent mental health,"" ""digital intervention,"" and ""engagement."" Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed using rigorous inclusion criteria and screening by at least two reviewers. The selected articles were assessed for quality using the mixed methods appraisal tool, and data were extracted to address the review aims. Data aggregation and synthesis were conducted and presented as descriptive numerical summaries and a narrative synthesis, respectively. RESULTS: This study identified 6 modes of delivery from 83 articles and 71 interventions for engaging CYP: (1) websites, (2) games and computer-assisted programs, (3) apps, (4) robots and digital devices, (5) virtual reality, and (6) mobile text messaging. Overall, 2 themes emerged highlighting intervention-specific and person-specific barriers and facilitators to CYP's engagement. These themes encompassed factors such as suitability, usability, and acceptability of the DHIs and motivation, capability, and opportunity for the CYP using DHIs. The literature highlighted that CYP prefer DHIs with features such as videos, limited text, ability to personalize, ability to connect with others, and options to receive text message reminders. The findings of this review suggest a high average retention rate of 79% in studies involving various DHIs. CONCLUSIONS: The development of DHIs is increasing and may be of interest to CYP, particularly in the area of MH treatment. With continuous technological advancements, it is important to know which modalities may increase engagement and help CYP who are facing MH problems. This review identified the existing modalities and highlighted the influencing factors from the perspective of CYP. This knowledge provides information that can be used to design and evaluate new interventions and offers important theoretical insights into how and why CYP engage in DHIs."
Telehealth Interventions to Improve Obstetric and Gynecologic Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review,"DeNicola N, Grossman D, Marko K, Sonalkar S, Butler Tobah YS, Ganju N, Witkop CT, Henderson JT, Butler JL, Lowery C.",Obstet Gynecol. 2020 Feb;135(2):371-382. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000003646.,DeNicola N,Obstet Gynecol,2020,2020/01/25,PMC7012339,,10.1097/AOG.0000000000003646,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effectiveness of telehealth interventions for improving obstetric and gynecologic health outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Qualifying primary studies had a comparison group, were conducted in countries ranked very high on the United Nations Human Development Index, published in English, and evaluated obstetric and gynecologic health outcomes. Cochrane Collaboration's tool and ROBINS-I tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Summary of evidence tables were created using the United States Preventive Services Task Force Summary of Evidence Table for Evidence Reviews. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, RESULTS: Of the 3,926 published abstracts identified, 47 met criteria for inclusion and included 31,967 participants. Telehealth interventions overall improved obstetric outcomes related to smoking cessation and breastfeeding. Telehealth interventions decreased the need for high-risk obstetric monitoring office visits while maintaining maternal and fetal outcomes. One study found reductions in diagnosed preeclampsia among women with gestational hypertension. Telehealth interventions were effective for continuation of oral and injectable contraception; one text-based study found increased oral contraception rates at 6 months. Telehealth provision of medication abortion services had similar clinical outcomes compared with in-person care and improved access to early abortion. Few studies suggested utility for telehealth to improve notification of sexually transmitted infection test results and app-based intervention to improve urinary incontinence symptoms. CONCLUSION: Telehealth interventions were associated with improvements in obstetric outcomes, perinatal smoking cessation, breastfeeding, early access to medical abortion services, and schedule optimization for high-risk obstetrics. Further well-designed studies are needed to examine these interventions and others to generate evidence that can inform decisions about implementation of newer telehealth technologies into obstetrics and gynecology practice."

However, its effectiveness remains unclear. We aimed to synthesise the evidence of the effectiveness of TPIs in improving depressive symptoms of PLWHA using a meta-analytic approach. Seven databases were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the inception until August 14, 2018. Random-effects meta-analysis was adopted to assess effect size. Cochran's Q test and I(2) were used to investigate the problem of heterogeneity. Sensitivity, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed. Of the 43,048 records identified, 14 RCTs were included. The meta-analysis revealed a small effect on reducing depressive symptom scores (d = 0.23, 95% CI - 0.39 to - 0.06) after TPIs. Random-effects meta-regression showed that publication year was a significant moderator (p = 0.013), whereby the latest trials had larger effect size in reducing the depressive symptoms than earlier trials. Our review suggested a possible future approach of utilising TPIs by means of mobile applications and internet-based interventions for PLWHA to reduce their depressive symptoms. This review highlighted the essential key features in designing future TPIs. The overall low-quality evidence suggested the need to conduct further high-quality."

However, few obesity intervention studies have documented process evaluation methods and results. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) requires that process evaluation methods be developed to (a) prioritize community members' power to adapt the program to local needs over strict adherence to intervention protocols, (b) share process evaluation data with implementers to maximize benefit to participants, and (c) ensure partner organizations are not overburdened. Co-designed with low-income parents using CBPR, Communities for Healthy Living (CHL) is a family-centered intervention implemented within Head Start to prevent childhood obesity and promote family well-being. We are currently undertaking a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of CHL in 23 Head Start centers in the greater Boston area. In this protocol paper, we outline an embedded process evaluation designed to monitor intervention adherence and adaptation, support ongoing quality improvement, and examine contextual factors that may moderate intervention implementation and/or effectiveness. METHODS: This mixed methods process evaluation was developed using the Perez et al. framework for evaluating adaptive interventions and is reported following guidelines outlined by Grant et al. Trained research assistants will conduct structured observations of intervention sessions. Intervention facilitators and recipients, along with Head Start staff, will complete surveys and semi-structured interviews. De-identified data for all eligible children and families will be extracted from Head Start administrative records. Qualitative data will be analyzed thematically. Quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated using triangulation methods to assess intervention adherence, monitor adaptations, and identify moderators of intervention implementation and effectiveness. DISCUSSION: A diverse set of quantitative and qualitative data sources are employed to fully characterize CHL implementation. Simultaneously, CHL's process evaluation will provide a case study on strategies to address the challenges of process evaluation for CBPR interventions. Results from this process evaluation will help to explain variation in intervention implementation and outcomes across Head Start programs, support CHL sustainability and future scale-up, and provide guidance for future complex interventions developed using CBPR.

Given that alcohol use increases the likelihood of HIV risk behaviors, and HIV disproportionately affects SMMT individuals, there is a need to test interventions that reduce hazardous alcohol use and subsequent HIV risk behaviors among this population. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile phones to deliver risk reduction messages based on current location and behaviors, can help to address triggers that lead to drinking in real time. OBJECTIVE: This study will test an EMI that uses motivational interviewing (MI), smartphone surveys, mobile breathalyzers, and location tracking to provide real-time messaging that addresses triggers for drinking when SMMT individuals visit locations associated with hazardous alcohol use. In addition, the intervention will deliver harm reduction messaging if individuals report engaging in alcohol use. METHODS: We will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial (N=405 HIV-negative SMMT individuals; n=135, 33% per arm) comparing the following conditions: (1) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption (a smartphone-delivered 4-session MI intervention), (2) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption and Environmental Risk (an EMI combining MI with real-time messaging based on geographic locations that are triggers to drinking), and (3) a smartphone-based alcohol monitoring-only control group. Breathalyzer results and daily self-reports will be used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes of drinking days, drinks per drinking day, binge drinking episodes, and HIV risk behaviors. Additional assessments at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months will evaluate exploratory long-term outcomes. RESULTS: The study is part of a 5-year research project funded in August 2022 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The first 1.5 years of the study will be dedicated to planning and development activities, including formative research, app design and testing, and message design and testing. The subsequent 3.5 years will see the study complete participant recruitment, data collection, analyses, report writing, and dissemination. We expect to complete all study data collection in or before January 2027. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide novel evidence about the relative efficacy of using a smartphone-delivered MI intervention and real-time messaging to address triggers for hazardous alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors. The EMI approach, which incorporates location-based preventive messaging and behavior surveys, may help to better understand the complexity of daily stressors among SMMT individuals and their impact on hazardous alcohol use and HIV risk behaviors. The tailoring of this intervention toward SMMT individuals helps to address their underrepresentation in existing alcohol use research and will be promising for informing where structural alcohol use prevention and treatment interventions are needed to support SMMT individuals.

Effectiveness and Appropriateness of mHealth Interventions for Maternal and Child Health: Systematic Review,"Chen H, Chai Y, Dong L, Niu W, Zhang P.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2018 Jan 9;6(1):e7. doi: 10.2196/mhealth.8998.,Chen H,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2018,2018/01/11,PMC5780618,,10.2196/mhealth.8998,"BACKGROUND: The application of mobile health (mHealth) technology in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) is increasing worldwide. However, best practice and the most effective mHealth interventions have not been reviewed systematically. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of mHealth interventions for RMNCH around the world were conducted to investigate their characteristics as well as the features and effectiveness of mHealth interventions. METHODS: Studies of mHealth interventions for RMNCH between January 2011 and December 2016 were retrieved from 6 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Medium). Comparable studies were included in a random-effects meta-analysis for both exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and antenatal checks (ANC). Descriptive analyses were conducted for mHealth studies with a range of study designs. RESULTS: Analyses of 245 studies were included, including 51 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results showed that there are increasing numbers of studies on mHealth interventions for RMNCH. Although 2 meta-analysis, one with 2 RCTs on EBF (odds ratio [OR] 2.03, 95% CI 1.34-3.08, I(2)=25%) and the other with 3 RCTs on ANC (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.13-1.79, I(2)=78%), showed that mHealth interventions are more effective than usual care, almost half (43%) of RCTs showed negative or unclear results on mHealth interventions. Functions described in mHealth interventions were diverse, and the health stages covered were broad. However, single function or single stage appeared to be dominant among mHealth interventions compared with multiple functions or stages. CONCLUSIONS: More rigorous evaluations are needed to draw consistent conclusions and to analyze mHealth products with multiple functions, especially those popular in the app markets."
"Improving pediatric COVID-19 vaccine uptake using an mHealth tool (MoVeUp): study protocol for a randomized, controlled trial","McCulloh RJ, Darden PM, Snowden J, Ounpraseuth S, Lee J, Clarke M, Newcomer SR, Fu L, Hubberd D, Baldner J, Garza M, Kerns E.",Trials. 2022 Oct 28;23(1):911. doi: 10.1186/s13063-022-06819-3.,McCulloh RJ,Trials,2022,2022/10/29,PMC9616622,,10.1186/s13063-022-06819-3,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines demonstrate excellent effectiveness against infection, severe disease, and death. However, pediatric COVID-19 vaccination rates lag among individuals from rural and other medically underserved communities. The research objective of the current protocol is to determine the effectiveness of a vaccine communication mobile health (mHealth) application (app) on parental decisions to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. METHODS: Custodial parents/caregivers with >/= 1 child eligible for COVID-19 vaccination who have not yet received the vaccine will be randomized to download one of two mHealth apps. The intervention app will address logistical and motivational barriers to pediatric COVID-19 vaccination. Participants will receive eight weekly push notifications followed by two monthly push notifications (cues to action) regarding vaccinating their child. Through branching logic, users will access customized content based on their locality, degree of rurality-urbanicity, primary language (English/Spanish), race/ethnicity, and child's age to address COVID-19 vaccine knowledge and confidence gaps. The control app will provide push notifications and information on general pediatric health and infection prevention and mitigation strategies based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The primary outcome is the proportion of children who complete COVID-19 vaccination series. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of children who receive >/= 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine and changes in parent/caregiver scores from baseline to immediately post-intervention on the modified WHO SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Scale adapted for the COVID-19 vaccine. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic inflicts disproportionate harm on individuals from underserved communities, including those in rural settings. Maximizing vaccine uptake in these communities will decrease infection rates, severe illness, and death. Given that most US families from these communities use smart phones, mHealth interventions hold the promise of broad uptake. Bundling multiple mHealth vaccine uptake interventions into a single app may maximize the impact of deploying such a tool to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The new knowledge to be gained from this study will directly inform future efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates across diverse settings and provide an evidentiary base for app-based vaccine communication tools that can be adapted to future vaccine-deployment efforts.

HIV Prevention Via Mobile Messaging for Men Who Have Sex With Men (M-Cubed): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Sullivan PS, Zahn RJ, Wiatrek S, Chandler CJ, Hirshfield S, Stephenson R, Bauermeister JA, Chiasson MA, Downing MJ Jr, Gelaude DJ, Siegler AJ, Horvath K, Rogers E, Alas A, Olansky EJ, Saul H, Rosenberg ES, Mansergh G.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Nov 15;8(11):e16439. doi: 10.2196/16439.,Sullivan PS,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/11/16,PMC6884718,,10.2196/16439,"BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be the predominately impacted risk group in the United States HIV epidemic and are a priority group for risk reduction in national strategic goals for HIV prevention. Modeling studies have demonstrated that a comprehensive package of status-tailored HIV prevention and care interventions have the potential to substantially reduce new infections among MSM. However, uptake of basic prevention services, including HIV testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, condom distribution, condom-compatible lubricant distribution, and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is suboptimal. Further, stronger public health strategies are needed to promote engagement in HIV care and viral load suppression among MSM living with HIV. Mobile health (mHealth) tools can help inform and encourage MSM regarding HIV prevention, care, and treatment, especially among men who lack access to conventional medical services. This protocol details the design and procedures of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a novel mHealth intervention that comprises a comprehensive HIV prevention app and brief, tailored text- and video-based messages that are systematically presented to participants based on the participants' HIV status and level of HIV acquisition risk. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the RCT was to test the efficacy of the Mobile Messaging for Men (M-Cubed, or M3) app among at least 1200 MSM in Atlanta, Detroit, and New York. The goal was to determine its ability to increase HIV testing (HIV-negative men), STI testing (all men), condom use for anal sex (all men), evaluation for PrEP eligibility, uptake of PrEP (higher risk HIV-negative men), engagement in HIV care (men living with HIV), and uptake of and adherence to antiretroviral medications (men living with HIV). A unique benefit of this approach is the HIV serostatus-inclusiveness of the intervention, which includes both HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM. METHODS: MSM were recruited through online and venue-based approaches in Atlanta, Detroit, and New York City. Men who were eligible and consented were randomized to the intervention (immediate access to the M3 app for a period of three months) or to the waitlist-control (delayed access) group. Outcomes were evaluated immediately postintervention or control period, and again three and six months after the intervention period. Main outcomes will be reported as period prevalence ratios or hazards, depending on the outcome. Where appropriate, serostatus/risk-specific outcomes will be evaluated in relevant subgroups. Men randomized to the control condition were offered the opportunity to use (and evaluate) the M3 app for a three-month period after the final RCT outcome assessment. RESULTS: M3 enrollment began in January 2018 and concluded in November 2018. A total of 1229 MSM were enrolled. Data collection was completed in September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT of the M3 mobile app seeks to determine the effects of an HIV serostatus-inclusive intervention on the use of multiple HIV prevention and care-related outcomes among MSM. A strength of the design is that it incorporates a large sample and broad range of MSM with differing prevention needs in three cities with high prevalence of HIV among MSM.

Examining Factors of Engagement With Digital Interventions for Weight Management: Rapid Review,"Sharpe EE, Karasouli E, Meyer C.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2017 Oct 23;6(10):e205. doi: 10.2196/resprot.6059.,Sharpe EE,JMIR Res Protoc,2017,2017/10/25,PMC5673884,,10.2196/resprot.6059,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions for weight management provide a unique opportunity to target daily lifestyle choices and eating behaviors over a sustained period of time. However, recent evidence has demonstrated a lack of user engagement with digital health interventions, impacting on the levels of intervention effectiveness. Thus, it is critical to identify the factors that may facilitate user engagement with digital health interventions to encourage behavior change and weight management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and synthesize the available evidence to gain insights about users' perspectives on factors that affect engagement with digital interventions for weight management. METHODS: A rapid review methodology was adopted. The search strategy was executed in the following databases: Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated users' engagement with a digital weight management intervention and were published from 2000 onwards. A narrative synthesis of data was performed on all included studies. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies were included in the review. The studies were qualitative, mixed-methods, or randomized controlled trials. Some of the studies explored features influencing engagement when using a Web-based digital intervention, others specifically explored engagement when accessing a mobile phone app, and some looked at engagement after text message (short message service, SMS) reminders. Factors influencing engagement with digital weight management interventions were found to be both user-related (eg, perceived health benefits) and digital intervention-related (eg, ease of use and the provision of personalized information). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of incorporating user perspectives during the digital intervention development process to encourage engagement. The review contributes to our understanding of what facilitates user engagement and points toward a coproduction approach for developing digital interventions for weight management. Particularly, it highlights the importance of thinking about user-related and digital tool-related factors from the very early stages of the intervention development process."
Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Codeveloped e-Mental Health Intervention for University Students: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Wang AY, Vereschagin M, Richardson CG, Xie H, Hudec KL, Munthali RJ, Munro L, Leung C, Kessler RC, Vigo DV.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Aug 30;12:e49364. doi: 10.2196/49364.,Wang AY,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/08/30,PMC10500355,,10.2196/49364,"BACKGROUND: University life typically occurs during a period of life transition, where the incidence of mental health and substance use problems and disorders peaks. However, relatively few students obtain effective treatment and support. e-Interventions have proven effective in improving the psychological outcomes of university students and have the potential to provide scalable services that can easily integrate into existing models of care. Minder is a mobile app codeveloped with university students that offers users a collection of evidence-based interventions tailored to help university students maintain their mental health and well-being and manage their substance use. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to assess the effectiveness of the Minder app in improving the mental health and substance use outcomes of university students. METHODS: This study is a 2-arm, parallel assignment, single-blinded, 30-day RCT with 1 intervention group and 1 waitlist control group. Overall, 1496 (748 per trial arm) university students from the University of British Columbia Vancouver Campus (N=54,000) who are aged >/=17 years, have a smartphone with Wi-Fi or cellular data, and speak English will be recruited via a variety of web-based and offline strategies. Participants will be randomized into the intervention or control group after completing a baseline survey. Those randomized into the intervention group will gain immediate access to the Minder app and will be assessed at 2 weeks and 30 days. Those randomized into the control group will be given access to the app content after their follow-up assessment at 30 days. The primary outcomes are measured from baseline to follow-up at 30 days and include changes in general anxiety symptomology, depressive symptomology, and alcohol consumption risk measured by the General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item scale, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item scale, and US Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Scale, respectively. Secondary outcomes include measures related to changes in the frequency of substance use, mental well-being, self-efficacy in managing mental health and substance use, readiness to change, and self-reported use of mental health services and supports (including referral) from baseline to follow-up at 30 days. RESULTS: Trial recruitment and data collection began in September 2022, and the completion of data collection for the trial is anticipated by June 2023. As of May 10, 2023, a total of 1425 participants have been enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: The RCT described in this protocol paper will assess whether the Minder app is effective in improving the mental health and substance use outcomes of a general population of Canadian university students. Additional secondary outcome research aims to explore additional outcomes of interest for further research and better understand how to support students' general mental well-being.

Digital mental health interventions for the mental health care of refugees and asylum seekers: Integrative literature review,"Mabil-Atem JM, Gumuskaya O, Wilson RL.",Int J Ment Health Nurs. 2024 Jan 30. doi: 10.1111/inm.13283. Online ahead of print.,Mabil-Atem JM,Int J Ment Health Nurs,2024,2024/01/31,,,10.1111/inm.13283,"This study aimed to provide a critical analysis of the current literature on the use of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) for the management and treatment of mental health disorders among refugees and asylum seekers. These groups are among the most disadvantaged compared to the general population in terms of health and socio-economic status, due to conflicts and wars. The number of refugees fleeing their home countries is growing exponentially, and refugees experience trauma, torture, persecution and human right abuses, which have a profound effect on their mental health and overall well-being. The researchers conducted an integrative literature review from electronic databases Medline, CINAHL and Google Scholar, selecting articles published in English from 2010 to 2023. The thematic analysis of the 10 articles identified in the review revealed four main themes and two sub-themes: (1) types of digital health intervention/apps used; (2) barriers encountered in digital health intervention; (3) user experience of the digital health intervention and (4) mapping gaps. Two sub-themes were identified located in Theme 2: (2.1) Language and demographic barriers and (2.2) Structural barriers. The study showed that the use of DMHIs was associated with positive experiences among refugees and asylum seekers. Limited mental health care is offered to refugees and asylum seekers due to a range of logistical, political, economic, geographical, language, cultural and social barriers. DMHIs have the potential to overcome and/or moderate these barriers. The study concludes that the scaled implementation of effective DMHIs holds the possibility to improve the wider distribution of mental health care among refugees and asylum seekers. However, further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of DMHIs and to scale up studies for their utilisation among this group. In summary, this study highlights the potential of DMHIs in improving the mental health care of refugees and asylum seekers. The results of this study have important implications for mental health service providers, policymakers and researchers to address the mental health needs of this vulnerable/priority group."
Rapid Design and Delivery of an Experience-Based Co-designed Mobile App to Support the Mental Health Needs of Health Care Workers Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact Evaluation Protocol,"Lewis M, Palmer VJ, Kotevski A, Densley K, O'Donnell ML, Johnson C, Wohlgezogen F, Gray K, Robins-Browne K, Burchill L.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Mar 9;10(3):e26168. doi: 10.2196/26168.,Lewis M,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/02/26,PMC7945974,,10.2196/26168,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of health care workers' mental health and well-being for the successful function of the health care system. Few targeted digital tools exist to support the mental health of hospital-based health care workers, and none of them appear to have been led and co-designed by health care workers. OBJECTIVE: RMHive is being led and developed by health care workers using experience-based co-design (EBCD) processes as a mobile app to support the mental health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to health care workers. We present a protocol for the impact evaluation for the rapid design and delivery of the RMHive mobile app. METHODS: The impact evaluation will adopt a mixed methods design. Qualitative data from photo interviews undertaken with up to 30 health care workers and semistructured interviews conducted with up to 30 governance stakeholders will be integrated with qualitative and quantitative user analytics data and user-generated demographic and mental health data entered into the app. Analyses will address three evaluation questions related to engagement with the mobile app, implementation and integration of the app, and the impact of the app on individual mental health outcomes. The design and development will be described using the Mobile Health Evidence Reporting and Assessment guidelines. Implementation of the app will be evaluated using normalization process theory to analyze qualitative data from interviews combined with text and video analysis from the semistructured interviews. Mental health impacts will be assessed using the total score of the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ4) and subscale scores for the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Scale for anxiety. The PHQ4 will be completed at baseline and at 14 and 28 days. RESULTS: The anticipated average use period of the app is 30 days. The rapid design will occur over four months using EBCD to collect qualitative data and develop app content. The impact evaluation will monitor outcome data for up to 12 weeks following hospital-wide release of the minimal viable product release. The study received funding and ethics approvals in June 2020. Outcome data is expected to be available in March 2021, and the impact evaluation is expected to be published mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: The impact evaluation will examine the rapid design, development, and implementation of the RMHive app and its impact on mental health outcomes for health care workers. Findings from the impact evaluation will provide guidance for the integration of EBCD in rapid design and implementation processes. The evaluation will also inform future development and rollout of the app to support the mental health needs of hospital-based health care workers more widely.

Digital Rights and Mobile Health in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Protocol for a Scoping Review,"Poulsen A, Song YJC, Fosch-Villaronga E, LaMonica HM, Iannelli O, Alam M, Hickie IB.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Oct 3;12:e49150. doi: 10.2196/49150.,Poulsen A,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/10/03,PMC10582819,,10.2196/49150,"BACKGROUND: Digital technology is a means to uphold or violate human rights in various domains, including business, military, and health. Given the pervasiveness of mobile technology in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), mobile health (mHealth) interventions present an opportunity to reach remote populations and enable them to exercise civil and political rights and economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to health and education. Simultaneously, the ubiquity of mobile phones involves processing sensitive data which can threaten rights, including the right to privacy and nondiscrimination. Digital health is often promoted as advancing human rights and health equity; however, digital rights are underexplored in the literature on mHealth in LMICs. As such, creating an understanding of the digital rights topics covered in the 2022 literature is important to avoid exacerbating existing inequities relating to digital health design, use, implementation, and access. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to identify digital rights topics in the 2022 peer-reviewed literature on mHealth in LMICs. METHODS: The Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews guides this review. Searches were performed across 7 electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Ovid, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, and PubMed). The screening processes were guided by the research question ""What digital rights topics have been explored in the 2022 literature on mHealth in LMICs?"" Only papers addressing mHealth in LMICs and digital rights topics were included. Data extraction will include publication title, year, and type; first author's affiliation country; LMICs implicated; infrastructure challenges; study aims, design, limitations, and future work; health area; mHealth technology, functions, purpose or application, and target end users; human or digital right terms used; explicit rights topics cited; and implied rights topics. The results will be reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. RESULTS: This scoping review was registered in Open Science Framework (December 22, 2022). Title and abstract screening and full-text paper screening were completed in 2023. This resulted in 56 papers being included in the study. The target date for completing data extraction and publishing a case study of the initial findings is the end of 2023. The full scoping review findings are expected to be disseminated through various pathways benefiting academia, practice, and policy making by the end of 2024. These include journal papers, conference presentations, publicly available toolkits for research and practice, public webinars, and policy briefs with evidence-based policy recommendations emerging from this review. CONCLUSIONS: The planned scoping review will identify digital rights topics in the 2022 literature at the intersection of mHealth and LMICs. Furthermore, it will highlight the importance of patient empowerment, data protection, and inclusion in mHealth research and related policies in LMICs.

Among working populations, lack of MVPA may also be a risk factor for absenteeism and presenteeism. Both traditional workplace-based and web-based interventions have been suggested as being effective in promoting participation MVPA, health-related outcomes, and work-related productivity. However, several challenges limit their application in real world contexts. A 'blended' intervention approach combining the two intervention strategies is proposed to overcome these limitations. The proposed intervention aims to utilize the blended approach to increase participation in MVPA, health-related outcomes, and work productivity among inactive workers. METHODS: The study will comprise of a three-group cluster randomized controlled trial (cluster-RCT), comprising a three-month actual intervention and a nine-month behavioral follow-up period. The three groups will be: a web-based intervention group, a blended intervention group combining the web-based components with face-to-face workshops and posters, and a control group. Physically inactive office employees (N = 495) from 33 companies (i.e., clusters) will be recruited and randomly assigned to the three groups by cluster randomization. The intervention mapping (IM) framework will be used for selecting and applying effective health behavioral theories and behavioral change techniques (BCTs) to the development, implementation and assessment of the intervention, which will be personally tailored. The primary outcome variable will be objectively-measured MVPA using an accelerometer. Secondary outcomes will consist of indices of health including adiposity, blood pressure, blood sugar, blood lipids, self-reported depression, anxiety, stress, health-related quality of life and work-related variables including absenteeism and presenteeism. DISCUSSION: The proposed study adopts a robust blended intervention approach that is expected to overcome challenges in applying workplace-based and web-based interventions separately and yield larger effects in promoting MVPA participation, health-related outcomes and work productivity. Improvements in work productivity outcomes will be of particular interest to employers. If more effective, the new blended intervention has the potential to be implemented on a larger scale to benefit workplace populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is prospectively registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov PRS (Trial ID: NCT04391270; Date of First Posted: May 18, 2020)."
A systematic review on the implementation of eHealth interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia,"Christie HL, Bartels SL, Boots LMM, Tange HJ, Verhey FJJ, de Vugt ME.",Internet Interv. 2018 Jul 7;13:51-59. doi: 10.1016/j.invent.2018.07.002. eCollection 2018 Sep.,Christie HL,Internet Interv,2018,2018/09/13,PMC6112102,,10.1016/j.invent.2018.07.002,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to (1) systematically review the literature on the implementation of eHealth interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia, and (2) identify determinants of successful implementation. METHODS: Online databases were searched for articles about eHealth interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia, providing information on their implementation. Articles were independently screened and inductively analyzed using qualitative analysis. The analysis was mapped onto the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009). FINDINGS: 46 articles containing 204 statements on implementation were included. The statements on implementation were grouped into four categories: Determinants associated with the eHealth application, informal caregiver, implementing organization, or wider context. Mapping of the determinants on the CFIR revealed that studies have focused mostly on characteristics of the intervention and informal caregiver. Limited attention has been paid to organizational determinants and the wider context. CONCLUSIONS: Despite prolific effectiveness and efficacy research on eHealth interventions for caregivers of people with dementia, there is a critical dearth of implementation research. Furthermore, there is a mismatch between eHealth intervention research and implementation frameworks, especially concerning organizational factors and wider context. This review underscores the importance of future implementation research in bridging the gap between research and practice."
Comparing Mobile Health Strategies to Improve Medication Adherence for Veterans With Coronary Heart Disease (Mobile4Meds): Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Study,"Park LG, Collins EG, Shim JK, Whooley MA.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2017 Jul 18;6(7):e134. doi: 10.2196/resprot.7327.,Park LG,JMIR Res Protoc,2017,2017/07/20,PMC5539386,,10.2196/resprot.7327,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to antiplatelet medications is critical to prevent life threatening complications (ie, stent thrombosis) after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), yet rates of nonadherence range from 21-57% by 12 months. Mobile interventions delivered via text messaging or mobile apps represent a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote behavior change and enhance medication adherence. OBJECTIVE: The Mobile4Meds study seeks to determine whether text messaging or a mobile app, compared with an educational website control provided to all Veterans, can improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or PCI. The three aims of the study are to: (1) determine preferences for content and frequency of text messaging to promote medication adherence through focus groups; (2) identify the most patient-centered app that promotes adherence, through a content analysis of all commercially available apps for medication adherence and focus groups centered on usability; and (3) compare adherence to antiplatelet medications in Veterans after ACS/PCI via a randomized clinical trial (RCT). METHODS: We will utilize a mixed-methods design that uses focus groups to achieve the first and second aims (N=32). Patients will be followed for 12 months after being randomly assigned to one of three arms: (1) customized text messaging, (2) mobile app, or (3) website-control groups (N=225). Medication adherence will be measured with electronic monitoring devices, pharmacy records, and self-reports. RESULTS: Enrollment for the focus groups is currently in progress. We expect to enroll patients for the RCT in the beginning of 2018.

Digital Interventions to Promote Self-Management in Adults With Hypertension: Protocol for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"McLean G, Murray E, Band R, Saunderson K, Hanlon P, Little P, McManus RJ, Yardley L, Mair FS.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2015 Nov 20;4(4):e133. doi: 10.2196/resprot.4648.,McLean G,JMIR Res Protoc,2015,2015/11/22,PMC4704904,,10.2196/resprot.4648,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions, defined as any intervention accessed and taking input from patients in the form of a computer/Web-based program or mobile phoned-based app, can potentially help empower patients to self-manage long-term conditions such as hypertension. Importantly, digital interventions have the potential to provide patients with personalized information and support for active involvement in treatment as well as cost saving. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the evidence for using digital interventions to support patient self-management of hypertension, and determine their impact on control and reduction of blood pressure, other clinical outcomes, quality of life, medication adherence, health service utilization, and economic benefits. METHODS: A systematic search of bibliographic databases including Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO will be undertaken. Abstracts and citations will be independently screened by 2 researchers against predetermined inclusion criteria. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion and further consideration of the inclusion criteria. Only randomized controlled trials which have been published in peer peer-reviewed journals with a diagnosis of hypertension will be considered. Inclusion criteria will be (1) adults (age >/= 18 years) with hypertension (as defined by the primary authors); (2) an interactive digital intervention compared with usual care; and (3) outcomes of objectively measured change in blood pressure. Data extraction from identified articles will be undertaken by 2 independent reviewers using a uniform template. The main outcomes are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and quality of life indicators. Secondary outcomes include cost- effectiveness, medication adherence, emotional well-being, and physical activity. Risk of bias of included studies will be assessed using the Cochrane tool. RESULTS: Our research is currently ongoing. Data will be summarized narratively, and if possible, meta-analyses will be performed to assess the impact of the interventions on outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: By summarizing and synthesizing available data, this review will help inform policy on the use of digital interventions for self-management of hypertension and will clarify areas for further research.

The Health Impact of mHealth Interventions in India: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Joshi V, Joshi NK, Bhardwaj P, Singh K, Ojha D, Jain YK.",Online J Public Health Inform. 2023 Sep 4;15:e50927. doi: 10.2196/50927. eCollection 2023.,Joshi V,Online J Public Health Inform,2023,2023/12/04,PMC10689051,,10.2196/50927,"BACKGROUND: Considerable use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions has been seen, and these interventions have beneficial effects on health and health service delivery processes, especially in resource-limited settings. Various functionalities of mobile phones offer a range of opportunities for mHealth interventions. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to assess the health impact of mHealth interventions in India. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Studies conducted in India, and published between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2021, were considered. A literature search was conducted using a combination of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms in different databases to identify peer-reviewed publications. Thirteen out of 1350 articles were included for the final review. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs and Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions tool (for nonrandomized trials), and a meta-analysis was performed using RevMan for 3 comparable studies on maternal, neonatal, and child health. RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed improved usage of maternal and child health services including iron-folic acid supplementation (odds ratio [OR] 14.30, 95% CI 6.65-30.75), administration of both doses of the tetanus toxoid (OR 2.47, 95% CI 0.22-27.37), and attending 4 or more antenatal check-ups (OR 1.82, 95% CI 0.65-5.09). Meta-analysis for studies concerning economic evaluation and chronic diseases could not be performed due to heterogeneity. However, a positive economic impact was observed from a societal perspective (ReMiND [reducing maternal and newborn deaths] and ImTeCHO [Innovative Mobile Technology for Community Health Operation] interventions), and chronic disease interventions showed a positive impact on clinical outcomes, patient and provider satisfaction, app usage, and improvement in health behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a comprehensive overview of mHealth technology in all health sectors in India, analyzing both health and health care usage indicators for interventions focused on maternal and child health and chronic diseases.

Economic Evaluations of mHealth Interventions for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes: A Scoping Review,"Tornvall I, Kenny D, Wubishet BL, Russell A, Menon A, Comans T.",J Diabetes Sci Technol. 2023 Jul 3:19322968231183956. doi: 10.1177/19322968231183956. Online ahead of print.,Tornvall I,J Diabetes Sci Technol,2023,2023/07/03,,,10.1177/19322968231183956,"BACKGROUND: There is plenty of evidence supporting the clinical benefits of mHealth interventions for type 2 diabetes, but despite often being promoted as cost-effective or cost-saving, there is still limited research to support such claims. The objective of this review was to summarize and critically analyze the current body of economic evaluation (EE) studies for mHealth interventions for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Using a comprehensive search strategy, five databases were searched for full and partial EE studies for mHealth interventions for type 2 diabetes from January 2007 to March 2022. ""mHealth"" was defined as any intervention that used a mobile device with cellular technology to collect and/or provide data or information for the management of type 2 diabetes. The CHEERS 2022 checklist was used to appraise the reporting of the full EEs. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the review; nine full and three partial evaluations. Text messages smartphone applications were the most common mHealth features. The majority of interventions also included a Bluetooth-connected medical device, eg, glucose or blood pressure monitors. All studies reported their intervention to be cost-effective or cost-saving, however, most studies' reporting were of moderate quality with a median CHEERS score of 59%. CONCLUSION: The current literature indicates that mHealth interventions for type 2 diabetes can be cost-saving or cost-effective, however, the quality of the reporting can be substantially improved. Heterogeneity makes it difficult to compare study outcomes, and the failure to report on key items leaves insufficient information for decision-makers to consider."
Asthma and Technology in Emerging African American Adults (The ATHENA Project): Protocol for a Trial Using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy Framework,"Baptist A, Gibson-Scipio W, Carcone AI, Ghosh S, Jacques-Tiura AJ, Hall A, MacDonell KK.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 May 10;11(5):e37946. doi: 10.2196/37946.,Baptist A,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/05/10,PMC9131162,,10.2196/37946,"BACKGROUND: Asthma causes substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States, particularly among African American emerging adults (AAEAs; aged 18-30 years), but very few asthma programs have targeted this population. Interventions that provide education and address underlying motivation for managing asthma may be the most effective. However, intensive face-to-face interventions are often difficult to implement in this population. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop an effective mobile asthma management intervention to improve control among AAEAs. METHODS: We will assess the ability of multiple technologic components to assist and improve traditional asthma education. The first component is the Motivational Enhancement System for asthma management. It is a mobile 4-session intervention using supported self-regulation and motivational interviewing. Personalized content is based on each participant's activity level, daily experiences, and goals. The second component is supportive accountability. It is administered by asthma nurses using targeted mobile support (Skype/voice calls) to provide education, promote self-efficacy, and overcome barriers through a motivational interviewing-based framework. The third component is SMS text messaging. It provides reminders for asthma education, medication adherence, and physical activity. The fourth component is physical activity tracking. It uses wearable technology to help meet user-defined physical activity goals. Using a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework, we will test intervention components and combinations of components to identify the most effective mobile intervention. The MOST framework is an innovative, and cost- and time-effective framework that uses engineering principles to produce effective behavioral interventions. We will conduct a component selection experiment using a factorial research design to build an intervention that has been optimized for maximum efficacy, using a clinically significant improvement in asthma. Participants (N=180) will be randomized to 1 of 6 intervention arms. Participants will be recruited from multiple sites of the American Lung Association-Airway Clinical Research Centers network and ambulatory care clinics at the Detroit Medical Center. Data collections will occur at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: At study completion, we will have an empirically supported optimized mobile asthma management intervention to improve asthma control for AAEAs. We hypothesize that postintervention (3, 6, and 12 months), participants with uncontrolled asthma will show a clinically significant improvement in asthma control. We also hypothesize that improvements in asthma management behaviors (including physical activity), quality of life, symptoms, adherence, and exacerbation (secondary outcomes) will be observed. CONCLUSIONS: AAEAs are disproportionately impacted by asthma, but have been underrepresented in research. Mobile asthma management interventions may help improve asthma control and allow people to live healthier lives. During this project, we will use an innovative strategy to develop an optimized mobile asthma management intervention using the most effective combination of nurse-delivered asthma education, a smartphone app, and text messaging.

The Use of Sensors to Detect Anxiety for In-the-Moment Intervention: Scoping Review,"Dobson R, Li LL, Garner K, Tane T, McCool J, Whittaker R.",JMIR Ment Health. 2023 Feb 2;10:e42611. doi: 10.2196/42611.,Dobson R,JMIR Ment Health,2023,2023/02/02,PMC9936367,,10.2196/42611,"BACKGROUND: With anxiety a growing issue and barriers to accessing support services, there is a need for innovative solutions to provide early intervention. In-the-moment interventions support individuals to recognize early signs of distress and use coping mechanisms to prevent or manage this distress. There is potential for wearable sensors linked to an individual's mobile phone to provide in-the-moment support tailored to individual needs and physiological responses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review is to examine the role of sensors in detecting the physiological signs of anxiety to initiate and direct interventions for its management. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through searches conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, ProQuest, and Scopus. Studies were identified if they were conducted with people with stress or anxiety or at risk of anxiety and included a wearable sensor providing real-time data for in-the-moment management of anxiety. RESULTS: Of the 1087 studies identified, 11 studies were included in the review, including 5 randomized controlled trials and 6 pilot or pretesting studies. The results showed that most studies successfully demonstrated improvements in their target variables. This included overall anxiety and stress levels, and the implementation of in-the-moment stress and anxiety management techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing. There was wide variation in the types of sensors used, physiological measures, and sensor-linked interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that sensors are potentially a useful tool in detecting anxiety and facilitating the implementation of a known control mechanism to reduce anxiety and improve mood, but further work is needed to understand the acceptability and effectiveness of this type of intervention."

Web-based psychosocial interventions have emerged as a promising alternative. OBJECTIVE: This meta-review aimed to synthesize evidence on recruitment challenges and enablers, factors that promote engagement and adherence to web-based intervention content, and factors that promote the efficacy of web-based psychosocial interventions for patients with cancer and cancer survivors. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of previous reviews that investigated the recruitment, engagement, and efficacy of web-based and app-based psychosocial interventions in adult patients with cancer and cancer survivors. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library database for relevant literature. The search terms focused on a combination of topics pertaining to neoplasms and telemedicine. Two independent authors conducted abstract screening, full text screening, and data extraction for each identified article. RESULTS: A total of 20 articles met eligibility criteria. There was inconsistency in the reporting of uptake and engagement data; however, anxiety about technology and perceived time burden were identified as 2 key barriers. Web-based psychosocial oncology interventions demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and stress but reported weak to mixed findings for distress, anxiety, quality of life, and well-being. Although no factors consistently moderated intervention efficacy, preliminary evidence indicated that multicomponent interventions and greater communication with a health care professional were preferred by participants and were associated with superior effects. CONCLUSIONS: Several consistently cited barriers to intervention uptake and recruitment have emerged, which we recommend future intervention studies address. Preliminary evidence also supports the superior efficacy of multicomponent interventions and interventions that facilitate communication with a health care professional. However, a greater number of appropriately powered clinical trials, including randomized trials with head-to-head comparisons, are needed to enable more confident conclusions regarding which web-based psychosocial oncology interventions work best and for whom.

"Effects of a Novel, Transdiagnostic, Hybrid Ecological Momentary Intervention for Improving Resilience in Youth (EMIcompass): Protocol for an Exploratory Randomized Controlled Trial","Schick A, Paetzold I, Rauschenberg C, Hirjak D, Banaschewski T, Meyer-Lindenberg A, Boehnke JR, Boecking B, Reininghaus U.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Dec 3;10(12):e27462. doi: 10.2196/27462.,Schick A,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/12/06,PMC8686407,,10.2196/27462,"BACKGROUND: Most mental disorders first emerge in youth and, in their early stages, surface as subthreshold expressions of symptoms comprising a transdiagnostic phenotype of psychosis, mania, depression, and anxiety. Elevated stress reactivity is one of the most widely studied mechanisms underlying psychotic and affective mental health problems. Thus, targeting stress reactivity in youth is a promising indicated and translational preventive strategy for adverse mental health outcomes that could develop later in life and for improving resilience. Compassion-focused interventions offer a wide range of innovative therapeutic techniques that are particularly amenable to being implemented as ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), a specific type of mobile health intervention, to enable youth to access interventions in a given moment and context in daily life. This approach may bridge the current gap in youth mental health care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the clinical feasibility, candidate underlying mechanisms, and initial signals of the efficacy of a novel, transdiagnostic, hybrid EMI for improving resilience to stress in youth-EMIcompass. METHODS: In an exploratory randomized controlled trial, youth aged between 14 and 25 years with current distress, a broad Clinical High At-Risk Mental State, or the first episode of a severe mental disorder will be randomly allocated to the EMIcompass intervention (ie, EMI plus face-to-face training sessions) in addition to treatment as usual or a control condition of treatment as usual only. Primary (stress reactivity) and secondary candidate mechanisms (resilience, interpersonal sensitivity, threat anticipation, negative affective appraisals, and momentary physiological markers of stress reactivity), as well as primary (psychological distress) and secondary outcomes (primary psychiatric symptoms and general psychopathology), will be assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at the 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: The first enrollment was in August 2019, and as of May 2021, enrollment and randomization was completed (N=92). We expect data collection to be completed by August 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to establish feasibility, evidence on underlying mechanisms, and preliminary signals of the efficacy of a compassion-focused EMI in youth. If successful, a confirmatory randomized controlled trial will be warranted. Overall, our approach has the potential to significantly advance preventive interventions in youth mental health provision.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials with at least one intervention arm delivered through the internet or mobile application, published in English until September 2021. Weight change at the end of the weight loss maintenance phase was considered the primary outcome. RESULTS: Twelve manuscripts with 2941 adults were included in the review; 10 studies were meta-analyzed. Included interventions had a duration of 3-30 months and were tested compared with minimum interventions (no contact with the study staff or intervention with only a limited number of features) or in-person groups. Technology-based interventions resulted in similar weight regain when compared with minimum interventions (ES = -0.07 kg; 95% CI = [-0.57, 0.42]; p = 0.770). However, when compared with in-person interventions, technology-based interventions were found to lead in significantly higher weight regain (ES = 1.36 kg; 95% CI = [0.29, 2.43]; p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Web- and app-based interventions for weight loss maintenance produced similar results with minimum interventions and resulted in greater weight regain compared with in-person interventions. Appropriate interventions for weight loss maintenance provide benefits against weight regain, only when provided in-person."
The state of mHealth development and use by palliative care services in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review of the literature,"Allsop MJ, Powell RA, Namisango E.",BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2018 Jun;8(2):155-163. doi: 10.1136/bmjspcare-2015-001034. Epub 2016 May 20.,Allsop MJ,BMJ Support Palliat Care,2018,2016/05/22,,,10.1136/bmjspcare-2015-001034,"BACKGROUND: Current coverage of palliative care services in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains woefully inadequate, but harnessing mHealth could be one approach to facilitate greater service coverage and engagement with patients with life-limiting progressive disease. AIMS: A systematic literature review to identify the development and use of mHealth in palliative care services in SSA. METHODS: 13 electronic databases from 1990 to 2015 were searched alongside the manual searching of journals and citation searching of included article reference lists. Articles were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria and study details extracted and tabulated by two researchers. Studies were plotted against a modified WHO mHealth and ICT framework to classify how they are targeting health system strengthening. RESULTS: Of the 1110 articles identified, 5 met the inclusion criteria, describing mHealth use in Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Malawi. Descriptive analysis has shown that existing mHealth interventions for palliative care services in SSA are limited in number and are being developed for use at the palliative treatment, guidance and coordination stage of care provision. Levels of detail about the development and structure of interventions are low. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth interventions for palliative care in SSA are limited. This is an opportune time to explore how evidence-based mHealth interventions could form part of the evolving palliative care services in the region."
Effect of mobile health interventions in increasing utilization of Maternal and Child Health care services in developing countries: A scoping review,"Venkataramanan R, Subramanian SV, Alajlani M, Arvanitis TN.",Digit Health. 2022 Dec 13;8:20552076221143236. doi: 10.1177/20552076221143236. eCollection 2022 Jan-Dec.,Venkataramanan R,Digit Health,2022,2022/12/19,PMC9756363,,10.1177/20552076221143236,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) technology is being used predominantly in low- and middle-income countries. Developing countries with low level of investment in health infrastructure can augment existing capacity by adopting low-cost affordable technology. The aim of the review was to summarize the available evidence on mHealth interventions that aimed at increasing the utilization of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) care services. Further, this review investigated the barriers which prevent the use of mHealth among both health care workers as well as beneficiaries. METHODOLOGY: A scoping review of literature was undertaken using the five-stage framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. The articles published between 1990 and 2021 were retrieved from three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, and Google Scholar) and grey literature for this review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was followed to present the findings. RESULT: A total of 573 studies were identified. After removing duplicates, studies not related to mHealth and MCH and publications of systematic reviews and protocols for studies, a total of 28 studies were selected for review. The study design of the research articles which appeared during the search process were mostly observational, cross-sectional, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We have classified the studies into four categories based on the outcomes for which the mHealth intervention was implemented: MCH care services, child immunization, nutrition services, and perceptions of stakeholders toward using technology for improving MCH outcomes. CONCLUSION: This brief review concludes that mHealth interventions can improve access to MCH services. However, further studies based on large sample size and strong research design are recommended."
"eHealth Interventions to Address HIV and Other Sexually Transmitted Infections, Sexual Risk Behavior, Substance Use, and Mental Ill-health in Men Who Have Sex With Men: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Melendez-Torres GJ, Meiksin R, Witzel TC, Weatherburn P, Falconer J, Bonell C.",JMIR Public Health Surveill. 2022 Apr 6;8(4):e27061. doi: 10.2196/27061.,Melendez-Torres GJ,JMIR Public Health Surveill,2022,2022/04/06,PMC9021948,,10.2196/27061,"BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men experience disproportionately high levels of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), sexual risk behavior, substance use, and mental ill-health. These experiences are interrelated, and these interrelations are potentiated by structural conditions of discrimination, stigma, and unequal access to appropriate health services, and they magnify each other and have intersecting causal pathways, worsening both risk for each condition and risk for the negative sequelae of each condition. eHealth interventions could address these issues simultaneously and thus have wide-ranging and greater effects than would be for any 1 outcome alone. OBJECTIVE: We systematically reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in addressing these outcomes separately or together. METHODS: We searched 19 databases for randomized trials of interactive or noninteractive eHealth interventions delivered via mobile phone apps, internet, or other electronic media to populations consisting entirely or principally of men who have sex with men to prevent HIV, STIs, sexual risk behavior, alcohol and drug use, or common mental illnesses. We extracted data and appraised each study, estimated meta-analyses where possible by using random effects and robust variance estimation, and assessed the certainty of our findings (closeness of the estimated effect to the true effect) by using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations). RESULTS: We included 14 trials, of which 13 included active versus control comparisons; none reported mental health outcomes, and all drew from 12 months or less of follow-up postintervention. Findings for STIs drew on low numbers of studies and did not suggest consistent short-term (<3 months postintervention; d=0.17, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.52; I(2)=0%; 2 studies) or midterm (3-12 months postintervention, no meta-analysis, 1 study) evidence of effectiveness. Eight studies considering sexual risk behavior outcomes suggested a short-term, nonsignificant reduction (d=-0.14, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.03) with very low certainty, but 6 studies reporting midterm follow-ups suggested a significant impact on reducing sexual risk behavior (d=-0.12, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.05) with low certainty. Meta-analyses could not be undertaken for alcohol and drug use (2 heterogeneous studies) or for HIV infections (1 study for each of short-term or midterm follow-up), and alcohol outcomes alone were not captured in the included studies. Certainty was graded as low to very low for most outcomes, including all meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: To create a comprehensive eHealth intervention that targets multiple outcomes, intervention evaluations should seek to generalize both mechanisms and components that are successfully used to achieve change in 1 outcome over multiple outcomes. However, additional evaluations of interventions seeking to address outcomes other than sexual risk behavior are needed before development and evaluation of a joined-up intervention."
mHealth Technology Use and Implications in Historically Underserved and Minority Populations in the United States: Systematic Literature Review,"Anderson-Lewis C, Darville G, Mercado RE, Howell S, Di Maggio S.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2018 Jun 18;6(6):e128. doi: 10.2196/mhealth.8383.,Anderson-Lewis C,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2018,2018/06/20,PMC6028762,,10.2196/mhealth.8383,"BACKGROUND: The proportion of people in the United States who are members of at least two ethnic groups is projected to increase to 10% by the year 2050. This makes addressing health disparities and health inequities in minority populations increasingly more difficult. Minority populations, including those who classify themselves as African American and Hispanic, are using mobile phones to access health information via the internet more frequently than those who classify themselves as white, providing unique opportunities for those in public health and health education to reach these traditionally underserved populations using mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to assess studies conducted in the United States that have used mHealth tools and strategies to develop and implement interventions in underserved populations. This review also examines the ways in which mHealth strategies are being employed in public health interventions to these priority population groups, as mobile phone capabilities include text messaging, mobile apps, internet access, emails, video streaming, social media, instant messaging, and more. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using key search phrases, the matrix method, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowchart diagram to identify key studies conducted between the years of 2009-2016 in the United States. These studies were reviewed for their use of mHealth interventions in historically underserved and minority populations. RESULTS: A total of 16,270 articles were initially identified using key search phrases in three databases. Titles were reviewed and articles not meeting criteria were excluded, leaving 156 articles for further review. After additional review for relevance and inclusion criteria, 16 articles were qualified and analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth is a promising area of development for public health and health education. While successful research has been done using text messaging (short message service, SMS) and other mHealth strategies, there is a need for more research using mobile phones and tablet applications. This literature review demonstrates mHealth technology has the ability to increase prevention and health education in health disparate communities and concludes that more specified research is needed."
Digital health interventions to support family caregivers: An updated systematic review,"Zhai S, Chu F, Tan M, Chi NC, Ward T, Yuwen W.",Digit Health. 2023 May 19;9:20552076231171967. doi: 10.1177/20552076231171967. eCollection 2023 Jan-Dec.,Zhai S,Digit Health,2023,2023/05/24,PMC10201006,,10.1177/20552076231171967,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S., and disease management largely falls onto patients' family caregivers. The long-term burden and stress of caregiving negatively impact caregivers' well-being and ability to provide care. Digital health interventions have the potential to support caregivers. This article aims to provide an updated review of interventions using digital health tools to support family caregivers and the scope of the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approaches. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on July 2019 and January 2021 in PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, ERIC, and ACM Digital Library, limiting to 2014-2021 to identify family caregiver interventions assisted by modern technologies. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation were used to evaluate the articles. Data were abstracted and evaluated using Rayyan and Research Electronic Data Capture. RESULTS: We identified and reviewed 40 studies from 34 journals, 10 fields, and 19 countries. Findings included patients' conditions and relationships with family caregivers, how the technology is used to deliver the intervention, HCD methods, theoretical frameworks, components of the interventions, and family caregiver health outcomes. CONCLUSION: This updated and expanded review revealed that digitally enhanced health interventions were robust at providing high-quality assistance and support to caregivers by improving caregiver psychological health, self-efficacy, caregiving skills, quality of life, social support, and problem-coping abilities. Health professionals need to include informal caregivers as an essential component when providing care to patients. Future research should include more marginalized caregivers from diverse backgrounds, improve the accessibility and usability of the technology tools, and tailor the intervention to be more culturally and linguistically sensitive."

Thus far, reviews of mHealth interventions for self-harm have been limited by study type. Therefore, we determined that a broader scoping review will provide a more exhaustive understanding of mHealth interventions for self-harm. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to identify mHealth interventions for self-harm within the literature, understand the types and features of interventions that have been developed and evaluated, highlight research findings around mHealth interventions for self-harm, and determine what outcomes are typically used to assess the efficacy of interventions. METHODS: A search was conducted using Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Studies were included if they described an mHealth intervention designed to have a direct (ie, if the intervention was designed for self-harm or for people who self-harm) or indirect (ie, if self-harm was measured as an outcome) treatment effect and if the paper was available in English. There were no exclusion criteria based on the study design. RESULTS: A total of 36 papers were included in the review, and most of them were randomized controlled trials published within the last 4 years. The interventions were mostly smartphone apps and calling or texting services, with 62% (21/34) having underlying therapeutic models to inform the intervention content. They were generally shown to be promising and appealing, but only 5 were widely available for use. Outcomes focused on a reduction of self-harm and suicidality, mood, and the users' experiences of the intervention. Samples were typically nondiverse, and there was limited variety in the study designs and in the measurements of self-harm recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Promising and appealing mHealth interventions have been developed but are not widely available. Research could benefit from greater diversity as well as a broader and more nuanced understanding of recovery from self-harm."
An mHealth intervention to prevent postnatal smoking relapse: The RESPREMO study protocol,"Dascal M, Rusu A, Onisor A, Blaga O, Miller M, Meghea C.",Tob Prev Cessat. 2020 Apr 14;6:24. doi: 10.18332/tpc/118724. eCollection 2020.,Dascal M,Tob Prev Cessat,2020,2020/06/18,PMC7291910,,10.18332/tpc/118724,"Up to 70% of women who quit smoking relapse after birth, usually within 3 months postpartum. The wide adoption of mobile technologies, especially smartphones, in recent years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) offers the possibility of low-cost, novel, and innovative mobile phone-based interventions for smoking relapse prevention. This study presents the protocol of the RESPREMO clinical trial for postnatal smoking relapse prevention for enrolled women, who recently gave birth and quit tobacco smoking before or during pregnancy, and their life partners. This work relies on data collected in two of the largest government-owned obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Seventy-five couples were randomized into one of three groups: a) 24 couples were allocated to the first intervention group and asked to install and use the xSmoker app; b) 26 couples were randomized to the second intervention group, who, in addition to the use of the xSmoker app, received text messages with content focused on motivation, problem solving, and dyadic efficacy; and c) 25 couples were randomized into a control group. Several measures of engagement with the xSmoker app were assessed, including duration of app use, the frequency of utilizing the tool to calculate savings from quitting, number of app-delivered challenges accepted by users, and number of app-delivered cessation and abstinence tips. If effective, RESPREMO is expected to have a sustainable impact on the prevention of postnatal relapse tobacco smoking with positive effects for both the mother and the newborn. The implications are beyond tobacco control, and relevant to the design and implementation of other mHealth behavioral interventions focused on the pregnancy and reproductive years in general."
Tailored mHealth intervention for improving treatment adherence for people living with HIV in Iran (HamRaah): protocol for a feasibility study and randomised pilot trial with a nested realist evaluation,"Ameli V, Haberer J, Sabin L, Meinck F, Barlow J, Taj L, Mohraz M.",BMJ Open. 2021 Jun 23;11(6):e042296. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042296.,Ameli V,BMJ Open,2021,2021/06/24,PMC8231034,,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042296,"INTRODUCTION: Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has a rising rate of new HIV infections and AIDS-related mortality. Consistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) leads to viral suppression, preventing HIV transmission and treatment failure. mHealth interventions can improve ART adherence by providing tailored support and directing patients to existing healthcare services. HamRaah (Persian for 'together-in-path') is the first mHealth-based intervention in a MENA country and is designed to improve adherence through two-way mobile messaging for people recently diagnosed with HIV in Tehran, Iran. The objectives of this pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) are to examine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of HamRaah, and to develop an explanatory theory for any observed effects through a nested realist evaluation. METHODS: A feasibility study and two-arm RCT of HamRaah, with an embedded realist evaluation will be conducted. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to HamRaah or routine care for a 6-month intervention. The initial effectiveness of HamRaah will be assessed through the primary outcome of self-reported ART adherence and several secondary outcomes: retention in care, CD4 count and viral suppression. A theory-driven realist evaluation framework will be used to develop an explanatory theory regarding what works, for whom, how and in what context. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received ethical clearance from Tehran University of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee and Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee People living with HIV in Tehran and key country stakeholders in HIV policy and programming have been involved in the development of HamRaah and this pilot trial. Participants will provide informed consent prior to study enrolment. The results will be disseminated to all stakeholders and presented in peer-reviewed journal publications and conferences.

Epub 2023 Oct 6.,Allan LP,Stroke,2023,2023/10/06,,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.123.043794,"Secondary prevention is a major priority for those living with stroke and may be improved through the use of mobile Health (mHealth) interventions. While evidence for the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for secondary prevention of stroke is growing, little attention has been given to the translation of these interventions into real-world use. In this review, we aimed to provide an update on the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for secondary prevention of stroke, and investigate their translation into real-world use. Four electronic databases and the gray literature were searched for randomized controlled trials of mHealth interventions for secondary prevention of stroke published between 2010 and 2023. Qualitative and mixed-methods evaluations of the trials were also included. Data were extracted regarding study design, population, mHealth technology involved, the intervention, and outcomes. Principal researchers from these trials were also contacted to obtain further translational information. From 1151 records, 13 randomized controlled trials and 4 evaluations were identified; sample sizes varied widely (median, 56; range, 24-4298). Short message service messages (9/13) and smartphone applications (6/13) were the main technologies used to deliver interventions. Primary outcomes of feasibility of the intervention were achieved in 4 trials, and primary outcomes of changes in risk factors, lifestyle behaviors, and adherence to medication improved in 6 trials. Only 1 trial had a hard end point (ie, stroke recurrence) as a primary outcome, and no significant differences were observed between groups. There was evidence for only 1 intervention being successfully translated into real-world use. Further evidence is required on the clinical effectiveness of mHealth interventions for preventing recurrent stroke, and the associated delivery costs and cost-effectiveness, before adoption into real-world settings."
A Digital Intervention to Improve Mental Health and Interpersonal Resilience in Young People Who Have Experienced Technology-Assisted Sexual Abuse: Protocol for a Nonrandomized Feasibility Clinical Trial and Nested Qualitative Study,"Bucci S, Varese F, Quayle E, Cartwright K, Machin M, Whelan P, Chitsabesan P, Richards C, Green V, Norrie J, Schwannauer M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Mar 21;12:e40539. doi: 10.2196/40539.,Bucci S,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/03/21,PMC10131936,,10.2196/40539,"BACKGROUND: No evidence-based support has been offered to young people (YP) who have experienced technology-assisted sexual abuse (TASA). Interventions aimed at improving mentalization (the ability to understand the mental states of oneself and others) are increasingly being applied to treat YP with various clinical issues. Digital technology use among YP is now common. A digital intervention aimed at improving mentalization in YP who have experienced TASA may reduce the risk of revictimization and future harm and make YP more resilient and able to manage distress that might result from TASA experiences. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe a protocol for determining the feasibility of the i-Minds trial and the acceptability, safety, and usability of the digital intervention (the i-Minds app) and explore how to best integrate i-Minds into existing routine care pathways. METHODS: This is a mixed methods nonrandomized study aimed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and usability of the intervention. Participants aged between 12 and 18 years who report distress associated with TASA exposure will be recruited from the United Kingdom from the National Health Service (NHS) Trust Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, sexual assault referral centers, and a web-based e-therapy provider. All participants will receive the i-Minds app for 6 weeks. Coproduced with YP and a range of stakeholders, the i-Minds app focuses on 4 main topics: mentalization, TASA and its impact, emotional and mental health, and trauma. A daily prompt will encourage YP to use the app, which is designed to be used in a stand-alone manner alongside routine care. We will follow participants up after the intervention and conduct interviews with stakeholders to explore the acceptability of the app and trial procedures and identify areas for improvement. Informed by the normalization process theory, we will examine barriers and enablers relevant to the future integration of the intervention into existing care pathways, including traditional clinic-based NHS and NHS e-therapy providers. RESULTS: This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Scotland. We expect data to be collected from up to 60 YP. We expect to conduct approximately 20 qualitative interviews with participants and 20 health care professionals who referred YP to the study. The results of this study have been submitted for publication. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility of recruiting YP to a trial of this nature and on the acceptability, safety, and usability of the i-Minds app, including how to best integrate it into existing routine care. The findings will inform the decision to proceed with a powered efficacy trial.

App-based interventions offer a promising platform for intervention delivery. This trial aims to pilot a theory-driven, app-based intervention that promotes brisk walking among people living with and beyond cancer. The primary aim is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures before conducting a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: This is an individually randomised, two-armed pilot RCT. Patients with localised or metastatic breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, who are aged 16 years or over, will be recruited from a single hospital site in South Yorkshire in the UK. The intervention includes an app designed to encourage brisk walking (Active 10) supplemented with habit-based behavioural support in the form of two brief telephone/video calls, an information leaflet, and walking planners. The primary outcomes will be feasibility and acceptability of the study procedures. Demographic and medical characteristics will be collected at baseline, through self-report and hospital records. Secondary outcomes for the pilot (assessed at 0 and 3 months) will be accelerometer measured and self-reported physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, and patient-reported outcomes of quality of life, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and habit strength for walking. Qualitative interviews will explore experiences of participating or reasons for declining to participate. Parameters for the intended primary outcome measure (accelerometer measured average daily minutes of brisk walking (>/= 100 steps/min)) will inform a sample size calculation for the future RCT and a preliminary economic evaluation will be conducted. DISCUSSION: This pilot study will inform the design of a larger RCT to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this intervention in people LWBC.

Digital psychosocial interventions for individuals with spinal cord injury: a scoping review,"Armstrong A, Oetinger K, Weimer K, Hönig K.",Front Psychiatry. 2024 Jan 22;15:1289138. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1289138. eCollection 2024.,Armstrong A,Front Psychiatry,2024,2024/02/06,PMC10838963,,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1289138,"OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the digital mental health care landscape for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: PubMed, PsycInfo, and PSYNDEX were searched for articles meeting the following criteria: (1) article written in English or German; (2) digital psychosocial intervention; (3) SCI only; (4) treatment of individuals with SCI and not their relatives or caregivers. Records were screened by title and abstract and records meeting the inclusion criteria were obtained for full text screening. The references of identified articles were screened to find further relevant articles. The literature search was updated before submission. Risk of Bias was assessed by using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and a narrative synthesis was conducted. RESULTS: Ten randomized-controlled trials (RCT) and ten non-randomized-controlled trials were identified and compared in this review, evaluating twelve internet- and mobile-based interventions, five smartphone apps, and three virtual reality applications. The interventions were primarily used as stand-alone aftercare programs. While some were not based on any theory, cognitive behavioral therapy mostly served as the theoretical basis for the online interventions. The extent of human support also varied greatly between the studies. The number of intervention modules ranged between 2 and 72. There were also major differences in outcome variables and effects. A meta-analytical evaluation of the data was not conducted due to heterogeneity of studies. CONCLUSION: Digital applications to promote the psychosocial health of individuals with SCI are an emerging field of research with many treatment approaches still to come. First high quality RCT studies report promising results. Unfortunately, not all studies are of high quality or the interventions have been insufficiently adapted to the needs of people with SCI. Therefore, more research is needed to further develop applications, and to generalize and test the effects found in the long term."

These can be used as the basis for timely interventions to prevent relapse. However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the implementation of EWS interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to establish the feasibility of conducting a definitive cluster randomized controlled trial comparing Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER) against treatment as usual (TAU). Our primary outcomes are establishing parameters of feasibility, acceptability, usability, safety, and outcome signals of a digital health intervention as an adjunct to usual care that is deliverable in the UK National Health Service and Australian community mental health service (CMHS) settings. We will assess the feasibility of candidate primary outcomes, candidate secondary outcomes, and candidate mechanisms for a definitive trial. METHODS: We will randomize CMHSs to EMPOWER or TAU. We aim to recruit up to 120 service user participants from 8 CMHSs and follow them for 12 months. Eligible service users will (1) be aged 16 years and above, (2) be in contact with local CMHSs, (3) have either been admitted to a psychiatric inpatient service or received crisis intervention at least once in the previous 2 years for a relapse, and (4) have an International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis of a schizophrenia-related disorder. Service users will also be invited to nominate a carer to participate. We will identify the feasibility of the main trial in terms of recruitment and retention to the study and the acceptability, usability, safety, and outcome signals of the EMPOWER intervention. EMPOWER is a mobile phone app that enables the monitoring of well-being and possible EWSs of relapse on a daily basis. An algorithm calculates changes in well-being based on participants' own baseline to enable tailoring of well-being messaging and clinical triage of possible EWSs. Use of the app is blended with ongoing peer support. RESULTS: Recruitment to the trial began September 2018, and follow-up of participants was completed in July 2019. Data collection is continuing. The database was locked in July 2019, followed by analysis and disclosing of group allocation. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge gained from the study will inform the design of a definitive trial including finalizing the delivery of our digital health intervention, sample size estimation, methods to ensure successful identification, consent, randomization, and follow-up of participants, and the primary and secondary outcomes. The trial will also inform the final health economic model to be applied in the main trial.

With the rise of technology, mobile health (mHealth) interventions, particularly smartphone apps, are emerging as a promising approach for addressing depression. However, the lack of standardized evaluation tools and evidence-based principles for these interventions remains a concern. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mHealth interventions for depression and identify the criteria and evaluation tools used for their assessment. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was carried out following the recommendations of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Studies that recruited adult patients exhibiting elevated depressive symptoms or those diagnosed with depressive disorders and aimed to assess the effectiveness or safety of mHealth interventions were eligible for consideration. The primary outcome of interest was the reduction of depressive symptoms, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the analysis. The risk of bias in the original RCTs was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. RESULTS: A total of 29 RCTs were included in the analysis after a comprehensive search of electronic databases and manual searches. The efficacy of mHealth interventions in reducing depressive symptoms was assessed using a random effects meta-analysis. In total, 20 RCTs had an unclear risk of bias and 9 were assessed as having a high risk of bias. The most common element in mHealth interventions was psychoeducation, followed by goal setting and gamification strategies. The meta-analysis revealed a significant effect for mHealth interventions in reducing depressive symptoms compared with nonactive control (Hedges g=-0.62, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.37, I(2)=87%). Hybrid interventions that combined mHealth with face-to-face sessions were found to be the most effective. Three studies compared mHealth interventions with active controls and reported overall positive results. Safety analyses showed that most studies did not report any study-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that mHealth interventions can be effective in reducing depressive symptoms, with hybrid interventions achieving the best results. However, the high level of heterogeneity in the characteristics and components of mHealth interventions indicates the need for personalized approaches that consider individual differences, preferences, and needs. It is also important to prioritize evidence-based principles and standardized evaluation tools for mHealth interventions to ensure their efficacy and safety in the treatment of depression. Overall, the findings of this study support the use of mHealth interventions as a viable method for delivering mental health care.

Mobile digital health (mHealth) interventions are increasingly being developed and evaluated, and have the potential to support recovery. This review evaluates the use of mHealth technology to assess, monitor and reduce functioning difficulties in people with SMI. Studies were systematically searched on multiple databases. Study quality was assessed and double-rated independently. Findings were organised using a narrative synthesis and results were summarised according to the mHealth device purpose, i.e., assessment and monitoring or intervention. Thirty-eight studies comprised of 2262 participants met the inclusion criteria. Smartphones were the most popular mHealth device; personal digital assistants, wearables and tablets were also used. mHealth was widely found to be acceptable and feasible, with preliminary findings suggesting it can support functional recovery by augmenting an intervention, simplifying the assessment, increasing monitoring frequency and/or providing more detailed information. Considerations for overcoming barriers to implementation, recommendations for future research to establish effectiveness, personalisation and specification of mHealth devices and methodologies are discussed. The value of mHealth for remote delivery of recovery based interventions is also considered."

The aim of this project is to design, develop and evaluate an online personalized intervention based on a risk algorithm for the universal prevention of anxiety disorders in the general population. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms (prevANS vs usual care) and 1-year follow-up including 2000 participants without anxiety disorders from Spain and Portugal will be conducted.The prevANS intervention will be self-guided and can be implemented from the prevANS web or from the participants' Smartphone (through an App). The prevANS intervention will have different intensities depending on the risk level of the population, evaluated from the risk algorithm for anxiety: predictA. Both low and moderate-high risk participants will receive information on their level and profile (risk factors) of anxiety disorders, will have access to stress management tools and psychoeducational information periodically. In addition, participants with a moderate-high risk of anxiety disorders will also have access to cognitive-behavioral training (problem-solving, decision-making, communication skills, and working with thoughts). The control group will not receive any intervention, but they will fill out the same questionnaires as the intervention group.Assessments will be completed at baseline, 6 and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of anxiety disorders. Secondary outcomes include depressive and anxiety symptoms, risk probability of anxiety disorders (predictA algorithm) and depression (predictD algorithm), improvement in physical and mental quality of life, and acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention. In addition, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will also be carried out from two perspectives, societal and health system, and analyses of mediators and moderators will also be performed. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, prevANS study will be the first to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a personalized online intervention based on a risk predictive algorithm for the universal prevention of anxiety disorders.

Digital rights and mobile health in Southeast Asia: A scoping review,"Poulsen A, Song YJ, Fosch-Villaronga E, LaMonica HM, Iannelli O, Alam M, Hickie IB.",Digit Health. 2024 May 28;10:20552076241257058. doi: 10.1177/20552076241257058. eCollection 2024 Jan-Dec.,Poulsen A,Digit Health,2024,2024/05/30,PMC11135094,,10.1177/20552076241257058,"OBJECTIVE: Digital technology has the potential to support or infringe upon human rights. The ubiquity of mobile technology in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) presents an opportunity to leverage mobile health (mHealth) interventions to reach remote populations and enable them to exercise human rights. Yet, simultaneously, the proliferation of mHealth results in expanding sensitive datasets and data processing, which risks endangering rights. The promotion of digital health often centers on its role in enhancing rights and health equity, particularly in LMICs. However, the interplay between mHealth in LMICs and digital rights is underexplored. The objective of this scoping review is to bridge this gap and identify digital rights topics in the 2022 literature on mHealth in Southeast Asian LMICs. Furthermore, it aims to highlight the importance of patient empowerment and data protection in mHealth and related policies in LMICs. METHODS: This review follows Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping reviews. Search results are reported using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. Frequency and content analyses were applied to summarize and interpret the data. RESULTS: Three key findings emerge from this review. First, the digital rights topics covered in the literature are sparse, sporadic, and unsystematic. Second, despite significant concerns surrounding data privacy in Southeast Asian LMICs, no article in this review explores challenges to data privacy. Third, all included articles state or allude to the role of mHealth in advancing the right to health. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement in digital rights topics in the literature on mHealth in Southeast Asian mHealth is limited and irregular. Researchers and practitioners lack guidance, collective understanding, and shared language to proactively examine and communicate digital rights topics in mHealth in LMIC research. A systematic method for engaging with digital rights in this context is required going forward."
mHealth to reduce HIV-related stigma among youth in the United States: a scoping review,"Mulawa MI, Rosengren AL, Amico KR, Hightow-Weidman LB, Muessig KE.",Mhealth. 2021 Apr 20;7:35. doi: 10.21037/mhealth-20-68. eCollection 2021.,Mulawa MI,Mhealth,2021,2021/04/26,PMC8063007,,10.21037/mhealth-20-68,"Multiple intersecting stigmas and discrimination related to sex, gender, HIV, and race/ethnicity may challenge HIV prevention and treatment service utilization, particularly among youth. This scoping review describes recent and ongoing innovative mobile health (mHealth) interventions among youth in the United States that aim to reduce stigma as an outcome or as part of the intervention model. To identify examples of stigma-mitigation via mHealth, we searched peer-reviewed published literature using keyword strategies related to mHealth, HIV, stigma, and youth (ages 10 to 29). We identified eleven articles that met our inclusion criteria, including three describing data from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), five describing pilot studies, one describing the process evaluation of an ongoing intervention, one describing formative work for intervention development, and one published study protocol for an ongoing intervention. We review these articles, grouped by HIV prevention and care continuum stages, and describe the mHealth approach used, including telehealth, simulation video games, motion comics, smartphone applications (apps), social media forums, online video campaigns, video vignettes, and a computerized behavioral learning module. Four studies focused on preventing primary acquisition through individual-level behavior change (e.g., reducing condomless anal intercourse), three focused on increasing HIV testing, three focused on linking to prevention services [e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)] and one focused on promoting adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Our review did not identify any published studies using mHealth with a primary aim to reduce stigma as a way to improve care engagement and increase viral suppression among youth in the United States. Additional RCTs and implementation studies examining the effectiveness of mHealth stigma-reduction interventions on HIV-related outcomes are needed to end the HIV epidemic among youth. mHealth offers unique advantages to address the complex intersecting stigma barriers along the HIV continuum to improve HIV-related outcomes for youth."
"Perioperative digital behaviour change interventions for reducing alcohol consumption, improving dietary intake, increasing physical activity and smoking cessation: a scoping review","Åsberg K, Bendtsen M.",Perioper Med (Lond). 2021 Jul 6;10(1):18. doi: 10.1186/s13741-021-00189-1.,Åsberg K,Perioper Med (Lond),2021,2021/07/06,PMC8258960,,10.1186/s13741-021-00189-1,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that unhealthy lifestyle behaviours are modifiable risk factors for postoperative complications. Digital behaviour change interventions (DBCIs), for instance text messaging programs and smartphone apps, have shown promise in achieving lifestyle behaviour change in a wide range of clinical populations, and it may therefore be possible to reduce postoperative complications by supporting behaviour change perioperatively using digital interventions. This scoping review was conducted in order to identify existing research done in the area of perioperative DBCIs for reducing alcohol consumption, improving dietary intake, increasing physical activity and smoking cessation. MAIN TEXT: This scoping review included eleven studies covering a range of surgeries: bariatric, orthopaedic, cancer, transplantation and elective surgery. The studies were both randomised controlled trials and feasibility studies and investigated a diverse set of interventions: one game, three smartphone apps, one web-based program and five text message interventions. Feasibility studies reported user acceptability and satisfaction with the behaviour change support. Engagement data showed participation rates ranged from 40 to 90%, with more participants being actively engaged early in the intervention period. In conclusion, the only full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT), text messaging ahead of bariatric surgery did not reveal any benefits with respect to adherence to preoperative exercise advice when compared to a control group. Two of the pilot studies, one text message intervention, one game, indicated change in a positive direction with respect to alcohol and tobacco outcomes, but between group comparisons were not done due to small sample sizes. The third pilot-study, a smartphone app, found between group changes for physical activity and alcohol, but not with respect to smoking cessation outcomes. CONCLUSION: This review found high participant satisfaction, but shows recruitment and timing-delivery issues, as well as low retention to interventions post-surgery. Small sample sizes and the use of a variety of feasibility outcome measures prevent the synthesis of results and makes generalisation difficult. Future research should focus on defining standardised outcome measures, enhancing patient engagement and improving adherence to behaviour change prior to scheduled surgery."
"Effectiveness of holistic mobile health interventions on diet, and physical, and mental health outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Zheng S, Edney SM, Goh CH, Tai BC, Mair JL, Castro O, Salamanca-Sanabria A, Kowatsch T, van Dam RM, Müller-Riemenschneider F.",EClinicalMedicine. 2023 Nov 18;66:102309. doi: 10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.102309. eCollection 2023 Dec.,Zheng S,EClinicalMedicine,2023,2023/12/06,PMC10694579,,10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.102309,"BACKGROUND: Good physical and mental health are essential for healthy ageing. Holistic mobile health (mHealth) interventions-including at least three components: physical activity, diet, and mental health-could support both physical and mental health and be scaled to the population level. This review aims to describe the characteristics of holistic mHealth interventions and their effects on related behavioural and health outcomes among adults from the general population. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Google Scholar (first 200 records). The initial search covered January 1, 2011, to April 13, 2022, and an updated search extended from April 13, 2022 to August 30, 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) were included if they (i) were delivered via mHealth technologies, (ii) included content on physical activity, diet, and mental health, and (iii) targeted adults (>/=18 years old) from the general population or those at risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or mental disorders. Studies were excluded if they targeted pregnant women (due to distinct physiological responses), individuals with pre-existing NCDs or mental disorders (to emphasise prevention), or primarily utilised web, email, or structured phone support (to focus on mobile technologies without exclusive human support). Data (summary data from published reports) extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were completed by two reviewers using a standard template and Cochrane risk-of-bias tools, respectively. Narrative syntheses were conducted for all studies, and random-effects models were used in the meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect of interventions for outcomes with comparable data in the RCTs. The study was registered in PROSPERO, CRD42022315166. FINDINGS: After screening 5488 identified records, 34 studies (25 RCTs and 9 pre-post NRSIs) reported in 43 articles with 5691 participants (mean age 39 years, SD 12.5) were included. Most (91.2%, n = 31/34) were conducted in high-income countries. The median intervention duration was 3 months, and only 23.5% (n = 8/34) of studies reported follow-up data. Mobile applications, short-message services, and mobile device-compatible websites were the most common mHealth delivery modes; 47.1% (n = 16/34) studies used multiple mHealth delivery modes. Of 15 studies reporting on weight change, 9 showed significant reductions (6 targeted on individuals with overweight or obesity), and in 10 studies reporting perceived stress levels, 4 found significant reductions (all targeted on general adults). In the meta-analysis, holistic mHealth interventions were associated with significant weight loss (9 RCTs; mean difference -1.70 kg, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.95; I(2) = 89.00%) and a significant reduction in perceived stress levels (6 RCTs; standardised mean difference [SMD] -0.32; 95% CI -0.52 to -0.12; I(2) = 14.52%). There were no significant intervention effects on self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (5 RCTs; SMD 0.21; 95%CI -0.25 to 0.67; I(2) = 74.28%) or diet quality scores (5 RCTs; SMD 0.21; 95%CI -0.47 to 0.65; I(2) = 62.27%). All NRSIs were labelled as having a serious risk of bias overall; 56% (n = 14/25) of RCTs were classified as having some concerns, and the others as having a high risk of bias. INTERPRETATION: Findings from identified studies suggest that holistic mHealth interventions may aid reductions in weight and in perceived stress levels, with small to medium effect sizes. The observed effects on diet quality scores and self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were less clear and require more research. High-quality RCTs with longer follow-up durations are needed to provide more robust evidence. To promote population health, future research should focus on vulnerable populations and those in middle- and low-income countries. Optimal combinations of delivery modes and components to improve efficacy and sustain long-term effects should also be explored.

The aim of the SMART-FM-SP study is to determine the effectiveness, cost-utility, and physiological effects in patients with FM of a digital intervention (STANZA(R)) currently marketed in the United States, which delivers smartphone-based, fully self-guided Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Digital ACT) for treating FM-related symptoms. METHODS: A single-site, parallel-group, superiority, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted, including a total of 360 adults diagnosed with FM. Individuals will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to treatment as usual (TAU), to TAU plus 12 weeks of treatment with Digital ACT, or to TAU plus 12 weeks of treatment with digital symptom tracking (i.e. FibroST). Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed models will be computed to analyze the effects of Digital ACT on functional impairment (primary outcome), as measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised at 6 months from the inception of the treatment. Secondary outcomes include impression of change, symptoms of distress, pain catastrophising, quality of life, cost-utility, and selected biomarkers (cortisol and cortisone, immune-inflammatory markers, and FKBP5 gene polymorphisms). The role of ACT-related processes of change will be tested with path analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first RCT that tests Digital ACT for Spanish patients with FM. Results will be important not only for patients and clinicians, but also for policy makers by examining the cost-utility of the app in a public healthcare context."

A Scoping Review on Accentuating the Pragmatism in the Implication of Mobile Health (mHealth) Technology for Tuberculosis Management in India,"Needamangalam Balaji J, Prakash S, Park Y, Baek JS, Shin J, Rajaguru V, Surapaneni KM.",J Pers Med. 2022 Sep 28;12(10):1599. doi: 10.3390/jpm12101599.,Needamangalam Balaji J,J Pers Med,2022,2022/10/27,PMC9605544,,10.3390/jpm12101599,"Background: India continues to share a colossal count of the global tuberculosis load, with a perturbing 19% spring in the reported cases in 2021. With the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) consolidated to bring this epidemic to an end by 2025, the rapidly growing mobile health technologies can be utilized to offer promising results. Even though the implementation of this novel strategy is escalating around the globe, its triumph is still sub optimal in India. Objectives: This scoping review intends to explore the available mobile health (mHealth) technologies and analyse the effectiveness of the same for tuberculosis management in India. Methods: An elaborate search in electronic databases, such as PubMed and Google scholar, using the key terms and focussing from the year 2015, provided very broad results focussing on mHealth interventions and their utilisation in TB management in India. Further selection of the inclusive publications was carried out based upon the eligibility requirements as formulated for this review, pertaining to the objective of this study. Results: The collaborate search yielded a total of 858 scientific research papers. After the filtering of the obtained results, a total of 45 articles were selected to be analysed for this review. Published manuscripts, articles in peer review and abstracts from reliable databases were included to obtain vast range of information. Conclusion: The extensive literature search showed a preponderance of mHealth intervention studies focusing on TB treatment and drug monitoring. There exists a paucity of mHealth applications targeted to educate the public and intercept this infectious disease. The scientific articles reviewed and analysed in this scoping review strongly recommend the demployment of mHealth applications to achieve the target of eradicating TB by 2025 in India."
Digital Interventions to Save Lives From the Opioid Crisis Prior and During the SARS COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review of Australian and Canadian Experiences,"Donnell A, Unnithan C, Tyndall J, Hanna F.",Front Public Health. 2022 Jul 12;10:900733. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2022.900733. eCollection 2022.,Donnell A,Front Public Health,2022,2022/07/29,PMC9314644,,10.3389/fpubh.2022.900733,"BACKGROUND: The potential for digital initiatives for opioid harm reduction is boundless. Synthesized evidence on current interventions and their efficacy are emerging. This scoping review is an effort to aggregate Canadian and Australian digital health initiatives used to prevent opioid-related deaths and minimize harm, prior to and particularly during the pandemic of SARs-COVID-19, when the crisis escalated. METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institute's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews was used. Peer reviewed and gray literature published between January 2016 to October 2021 were included. Search translation was performed across CINAHL, Cochrane, SCOPUS, MEDLINE Complete, and ProQuest Public Health with consistent use of key search terms. Citation checks were also conducted. Studies included were written in English and reported on digital technologies to prevent opioid-related harm and/or mortality in participants aged 18 years or older in Australia and Canada. RESULTS: A total of 16 publications were included in the final analysis (Australia = 5; Canada = 11). The most frequently reported digital technologies were telehealth to support access to treatment (n = 3) and mobile applications for overdose monitoring and prevention (n = 3). Telehealth-delivered opioid replacement therapy demonstrated equal outcomes and treatment retention rates compared to in-person and mobile applications for overdose monitoring demonstrated lifesaving capability through direct linkages with emergency response services. CONCLUSIONS: Digital interventions to minimize opioid crisis related harm and overdose prevention are fast emerging in Australia and Canada. During the pandemic, the crisis escalated in both countries as a public health emergency, and different initiatives were trialed. Digital harm reduction solutions via mobile apps (or SaaS solutions) were found to have the potential to prevent accidental overdose deaths and save lives, if rendered through privacy preserved, secure and trust enabled methods that empower users. Knowledge sharing between the two countries, relating to suitable interventions, may add significant value in combatting the escalating opioid crisis in the post pandemic era."
Leveraging Mobile Health to Manage Mental Health/Behavioral Health Disorders: Systematic Literature Review,"Kruse CS, Betancourt JA, Gonzales M, Dickerson K, Neer M.",JMIR Ment Health. 2022 Dec 27;9(12):e42301. doi: 10.2196/42301.,Kruse CS,JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022/10/04,PMC9832355,,10.2196/42301,"BACKGROUND: Mental health is a complex condition, highly related to emotion. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant spike in depression (from isolation) and anxiety (event related). Mobile Health (mHealth) and telemedicine offer solutions to augment patient care, provide education, improve symptoms of depression, and assuage fears and anxiety. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to assess the effectiveness of mHealth to provide mental health care by analyzing articles published in the last year in peer-reviewed, academic journals using strong methodology (randomized controlled trial). METHODS: We queried 4 databases (PubMed, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], Web of Science, and ScienceDirect) using a standard Boolean search string. We conducted this systematic literature review in accordance with the Kruse protocol and reported it in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) 2020 checklist (n=33). RESULTS: A total of 4 interventions (mostly mHealth) from 14 countries identified improvements in primary outcomes of depression and anxiety as well as in several secondary outcomes, namely, quality of life, mental well-being, cognitive flexibility, distress, sleep, self-efficacy, anger, decision conflict, decision regret, digestive disturbance, pain, and medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth interventions can provide education, treatment augmentation, and serve as the primary modality in mental health care. The mHealth modality should be carefully considered when evaluating modes of care.

Our scoping review aims to examine the effectiveness these interventions targeted to increase the uptake of cervical cancer screening along with its barriers and facilitators. We searched 4 databases (PsycINFO. PUBMED, CINAHL, and MEDLINE) for studies that were published between January 1, 2009 and October 2019. References were further screened manually for additional papers. Studies were included in the review if they used interventions including phone calls, text messages and mobile applications as their primary strategy to contact women. We identified 12 unique studies that met the inclusion criteria; seven were international studies. Most studies sent multiple messages (informative and reminder) and/or made numerous phone calls (manual/automated) to inform participants about cervical cancer screening, their nearest screening clinic, and their upcoming appointments. Five studies documented a significant increase in the uptake of cervical cancer screenings during the follow-ups conducted within 12 months. Qualitative studies suggested participants prefer particular communication mediums, and they were concerned about privacy and confidentiality issues when text messages were sent with their health information. Findings suggest mHealth interventions may be an effective strategy to reach women for improving their cervical cancer uptake. Barriers including transportation cost, inaccessibility, and inability to come for walk-in appointments in the health clinics need to be addressed, beyond reminders, in mobile phone-based interventions to facilitate their presence in their next appointment."

In addition, the use of new digital technologies in the neurorehabilitation field enables the implementation of telerehabilitation systems such as virtual reality interventions, video games, web-based interventions, mobile applications, web-based or telephonic telecoach programs, in order to facilitate the relationship between clinicians and patients, and to motivate and activate patients to continue with the rehabilitation process at home. Here we present a systematic review that aims at reviewing the effectiveness of different engagement strategies and the different engagement assessments while using telerehabilitation systems in patients with neurological disorders. We used PICO's format to define the question of the review, and the systematic review protocol was designed following the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Bibliographical data was collected by using the following bibliographic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review for full-text analyses. Overall, the reviewed studies using engagement strategies through telerehabilitation systems in patients with neurological disorders were mainly focused on patient self-management and self-awareness, patient motivation, and patient adherence subcomponents of engagement, that are involved in by the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of engagement. Conclusion: The studies commented throughout this systematic review pave the way for the design of new telerehabilitation protocols, not only focusing on measuring quantitative or qualitative measures but measuring both of them through a mixed model intervention design (1). The future clinical studies with a mixed model design will provide more abundant data regarding the role of engagement in telerehabilitation, leading to a possibly greater understanding of its underlying components."

However, their effectiveness in the context of cardiac surgery remains uncertain. This systematic review aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the use of digital health interventions for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Elsevier EMBASE, Elsevier Scopus databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted to identify relevant studies published up to the present. Studies that examined the effects of digital health interventions, including mobile applications and web-based interventions, on perioperative care and patient outcomes in cardiac surgery were included. The data were extracted and synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the findings. The search yielded 15 studies composed of 4041 patients, analyzing the feasibility and implementation of mobile or internet applications for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The studies included the use of mobile applications (ManageMySurgery, SeamlessMD, mHeart, Telediaglog, ExSed, Soulage Tavie, Heart Health application, and Mayo Clinic Health Connection) and web-based interventions (Heartnet and Active Heart). The findings indicated that these digital health interventions were associated with improved patient engagement, satisfaction, and reduced healthcare utilization. Patients reported finding the interventions helpful in their recovery process, and there was evidence of enhanced symptom monitoring and timely intervention. The completion rates of modules varied depending on the phase of care, with higher engagement observed during the acute phase. Interest in using digital health applications was expressed by patients, regardless of age, gender, or complexity of the cardiac defect. The results demonstrated that web-based interventions resulted in improvements in mental health, quality of life, and eHealth literacy. This systematic review highlights the potential benefits of digital health interventions in the context of cardiac surgery. Further research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to establish the effectiveness, feasibility, and generalizability of digital health interventions in cardiac surgery."

The availability of evidence-based psychological interventions for adults with ADHD is still poor. Interventions delivered over the Internet on smartphones or personal computers may help to increase the availability of effective psychological interventions. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of a self-guided Internet-delivered intervention on severity levels of ADHD symptomatology and quality of life. METHODS: We aim to include 118 participants with a self-reported ADHD diagnosis in a randomized controlled trial with two arms: 1) self-guided Internet-delivered intervention for coping with ADHD (N = 59); 2) self-guided online psychoeducation (control group, N = 59). After 3 months, the control group will be given access to the intervention. The primary clinical outcomes are inattention and quality of life. Secondary clinical outcomes are hyperactivity, stress and depression. Measures will be obtained at three time points: before (baseline), immediately after (8 weeks) and 3 months after the intervention. Uptake, usage, adherence and satisfaction will be explored. DISCUSSION: This RCT will provide valuable information on the clinical effectiveness of an Internet-delivered intervention for adults with ADHD. This study is, to our knowledge, one of the first randomized control trials that investigates the effects of a self-guided Internet-delivered psychological intervention in a fairly large group of adults with ADHD.

Over the last decade, technology has addressed these concerns from different disciplines. The current scoping review aimed to delineate novel and ongoing clinical research on technology-based psychosocial interventions for patients with BPD. Online databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar) were searched up to June 2020. Technology-based psychosocial treatments included innovative communication (eHealth) and computational (e.g., artificial intelligence), computing (e.g., computer-based), or medical (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) software. Clinical research encompassed any testing stage (e.g., feasibility, efficacy). Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The main findings were the following: almost two-thirds of the studies (9/15) tested software explicitly conceived as adjunctive interventions to conventional therapy; nearly half of the studies (7/15) were referred to as dialectical behavior therapy-based software; most studies (13/15) were focused on the initial stage of the clinical research cycle (feasibility/acceptance/usability testing), reporting good results at this point; more than one-third of the studies (6/15) tested mobile apps; there is emerging evidence for Internet-based interventions and real-time fMRI biofeedback but only little evidence for mHealth interventions, virtual and augmented reality, and computer-based interventions; there was no computational technology-based clinical research; and there was no satisfaction/preference, security/safety, or efficiency testing for any software. Taken together, the results suggest that there is a growing but still incipient amount of technology-based psychosocial interventions for BPD supported by some kind of clinical evidence. The limitations and directions for future research are discussed."

An urgent need exists for effective physical activity-promotion programs for the large number of older adults in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This study presents the development of the intervention and trial protocol of iCanFit 2.0, a multi-level, mobile-enabled, physical activity-promotion program developed for overweight older adults in primary care settings. METHODS: The iCanFit 2.0 program was developed based on our prior mHealth intervention programs, qualitative interviews with older patients in a primary care clinic, and iterative discussions with key stakeholders. We will test the efficacy of iCanFit 2.0 through a cluster randomized controlled trial in six pairs of primary care clinics. RESULTS: The proposed protocol received a high score in a National Institutes of Health review, but was not funded due to limited funding sources. We are seeking other funding sources to conduct the project. CONCLUSIONS: The iCanFit 2.0 program is one of the first multi-level, mobile-enabled, physical activity-promotion programs for older adults in a primary care setting. The development process has actively involved older patients and other key stakeholders. The patients, primary care providers, health coaches, and family and friends were engaged in the program using a low-cost, off-the-shelf mobile tool. Such low-cost, multi-level programs can potentially address the high prevalence of physical inactivity in older adults."

Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can reduce lung cancer mortality, but its adoption in the U.S. has been limited. Digital interventions have the potential to improve uptake of LCS. This systematic review aims to summarize the evidence for the effectiveness of digital interventions in promoting LCS. METHODS: A systematic search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Medline) was conducted to identify studies published between January 2014 and May 2023. Studies were reviewed and abstracted between February 2023 and July 2023. Outcomes related to knowledge, decision-making and screening were measured. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: Of 1,979 screened articles, 30 studies were included in this review. Digital interventions evaluated included decision aids (n=20), electronic health record (EHR)-based interventions (n=7), social media campaigns and mobile applications (n=3). Decision aids were the most commonly studied digital interventions, with most studies showing improved knowledge (13/13) and reduced decisional conflict (7/9) but most did not show a substantial change in screening use. Fewer studies tested clinician-facing or multi-level interventions. DISCUSSION: Digital interventions, particularly decision aids, have shown promise in improving knowledge and the quality of decision-making around LCS. However, few interventions have been shown to substantially alter screening behavior and few clinician-facing or multi-level interventions have been rigorously tested. Further research is needed to develop effective tools for engaging patients in LCS, to compare the efficacy of different interventions, and evaluate implementation strategies in diverse healthcare settings."
Remote Mobile Outpatient Monitoring in Transplant (Reboot) 2.0: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Murray KR, Foroutan F, Amadio JM, Posada JD, Kozuszko S, Duhamel J, Tsang K, Farkouh ME, McDonald M, Billia F, Barber E, Hershman SG, Bhat M, Tinckam KJ, Ross HJ, McIntosh C, Moayedi Y.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Oct 22;10(10):e26816. doi: 10.2196/26816.,Murray KR,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/09/16,PMC8571683,,10.2196/26816,"BACKGROUND: The number of solid organ transplants in Canada has increased 33% over the past decade. Hospital readmissions are common within the first year after transplant and are linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly half of these admissions to the hospital appear to be preventable. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies hold promise to reduce admission to the hospital and improve patient outcomes, as they allow real-time monitoring and timely clinical intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether an innovative mHealth intervention can reduce hospital readmission and unscheduled visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic. Our second objective is to assess the use of clinical and continuous ambulatory physiologic data to develop machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of infection, organ rejection, and early mortality in adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. METHODS: Remote Mobile Outpatient Monitoring in Transplant (Reboot) 2.0 is a two-phased single-center study to be conducted at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada. Phase one will consist of a 1-year concealed randomized controlled trial of 400 adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. Participants will be randomized to receive either personalized communication using an mHealth app in addition to standard of care phone communication (intervention group) or standard of care communication only (control group). In phase two, the prior collected data set will be used to develop machine learning algorithms to identify early markers of rejection, infection, and graft dysfunction posttransplantation. The primary outcome will be a composite of any unscheduled hospital admission, visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic, following discharge from the index admission. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated self-administered questionnaires, 1-year graft survival rate, 1-year patient survival rate, and the number of standard of care phone voice messages. RESULTS: At the time of this paper's completion, no results are available. CONCLUSIONS: Building from previous work, this project will aim to leverage an innovative mHealth app to improve outcomes and reduce hospital readmission in adult solid organ transplant recipients. Additionally, the development of machine learning algorithms to better predict adverse health outcomes will allow for personalized medicine to tailor clinician-patient interactions and mitigate the health care burden of a growing patient population.

Vaccine hesitancy and behavior change theory-based social media interventions: a systematic review,"Li L, Wood CE, Kostkova P.",Transl Behav Med. 2022 Feb 16;12(2):243-272. doi: 10.1093/tbm/ibab148.,Li L,Transl Behav Med,2022,2021/12/01,PMC8848992,,10.1093/tbm/ibab148,"It is widely acknowledged that vaccine hesitancy is a multifaceted problem that cannot be addressed by a single strategy. Behavior change theories and social media tools may together help to guide the design of interventions aimed at improving vaccination uptake. This systematic review aims to identify the breadth and effectiveness of such theories and tools. The systematic review search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, ACM, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases for studies between January 2011 and January 2021 that applied social media tools to increase vaccine confidence or improve vaccination uptake. The literature search yielded a total of 3,065 publications. Twenty articles met the eligibility criteria, 12 of which were theory-based interventions. The result shows that the Health Belief Model was the most frequently deployed theory, and the most common social media tool was educational posts, followed by dialogue-based groups, interactive websites, and personal reminders. Theory-based interventions were generally more measurable and comparable and had more evidence to trigger the positive behavior change. Fifteen studies reported the effectiveness in knowledge gain, intention increase, or behavior change. Educational messages were proved to be effective in increasing knowledge but less helpful in triggering behavior change. Dialogue-based social media intervention performed well in improving people's intention to vaccinate. Interventions informed by behavior change theory and delivered via social media platforms offer an important opportunity for addressing vaccine hesitancy. This review highlights the need to use a multitheory framework and tailoring social media interventions to the specific circumstances and needs of the target audience in future interventions. The results and insights gained from this review will be of assistance to future studies."
A Prescription Digital Therapeutic to Support Unsupervised Buprenorphine Initiation for Patients With Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Proof-of-Concept Study,"Luderer H, Enman N, Gerwien R, Braun S, McStocker S, Xiong X, Koebele C, Cannon C, Glass J, Maricich Y.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Jan 20;12:e43122. doi: 10.2196/43122.,Luderer H,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/01/20,PMC9898828,,10.2196/43122,"BACKGROUND: Home-based (unsupervised) buprenorphine initiation is considered safe and effective, yet many patients report barriers to successful treatment initiation. Prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs) are software-based disease treatments regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The reSET-O PDT was authorized by the FDA in 2018 and delivers behavioral treatment for individuals receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD). A prototype PDT (PEAR-002b) designed for use with reSET-O was developed to assist in unsupervised buprenorphine initiation. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the acceptability of PEAR-002b in individuals with OUD who use it to support buprenorphine initiation, their unsupervised buprenorphine initiation success rate, and their medication adherence. METHODS: Ten adults with OUD will be recruited for acceptability and feasibility testing. Outcomes will be assessed using week-1 visit attendance, participant interviews and satisfaction surveys, and urine drug screening (UDS). Three tools will be used in the study: PEAR-002b, reSET-O, and EmbracePlus. PEAR-002b includes a new set of features designed for use with reSET-O. The mechanism of action for the combined PEAR-002b and reSET-O treatment is a program of medication dosing support during week 1 of the initiation phase, cognitive behavioral therapy, and contingency management. During the medication initiation phase, participants are guided through a process to support proper medication use. PEAR-002b advises them when to take their buprenorphine based on provider inputs (eg, starting dose), self-reported substance use, and self-reported withdrawal symptoms. This study also administers the EmbracePlus device, a medical-grade smartwatch, to pilot methods for collecting physiologic data (eg, heart rate and skin conductance) and evaluate the device's potential for use along with PDTs that are designed to improve OUD treatment initiation. Home buprenorphine initiation success will be summarized as the proportion of participants attending the post-buprenorphine initiation visit (week 1) and the proportion of participants who experience buprenorphine initiation-related adverse events (eg, precipitated withdrawal). Acceptability of PEAR-002b will be evaluated based on individual participants' ratings of ease of use, satisfaction, perceived helpfulness, and likelihood of recommending PEAR-002b. Medication adherence will be evaluated by participant self-report data and confirmed by UDS. UDS data will be summarized as the mean of individual participants' proportion of total urine samples testing positive for buprenorphine or norbuprenorphine over the 4-week study. RESULTS: This project was funded in September 2019. As of September 2022, participant enrollment is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to our knowledge to develop a PDT that assists with unsupervised buprenorphine initiation with the intent to better support patients and prescribers during this early phase of treatment. This pilot study will assess the acceptability and utility of a digital therapeutic to assist individuals with OUD with unsupervised buprenorphine initiation.

Identifying Barriers and Facilitators of 13 mHealth Projects in North America and Africa: Protocol for a 5-Year Implementation Science Study,"Tilahun B, Smillie K, Bardosh KL, Murray M, Fitzgerald M, Cook V, Poureslami I, Forrest J, Lester R.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2018 Jul 3;7(7):e162. doi: 10.2196/resprot.9633.,Tilahun B,JMIR Res Protoc,2018,2018/07/05,PMC6053607,,10.2196/resprot.9633,"BACKGROUND: Although many mHealth interventions have shown efficacy in research, few have been effectively implemented and sustained in real-world health system settings. Despite this programmatic gap, there is limited conclusive evidence identifying the factors that affect the implementation and successful integration of mHealth into a health system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the individual, organizational, and external level factors associated with the effective implementation of WelTel, an mHealth intervention designed to support outpatient medication adherence and engagement in care in Africa and North America. METHODS: We will adopt the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs for evaluation of mHealth implementation including a scoring and monitoring system. We will apply the adapted tool to identify facilitators and barriers to implementation of the WelTel mHealth intervention in order to determine how the technology platform is perceived, diffused, adapted, and used by different mHealth project teams and health system actors in Africa and North America. We will use a mixed-methods approach to quantitatively test whether the factors identified in the CFIR framework are associated with the successful uptake of the mHealth intervention toward implementation goals. We will triangulate these data through interviews and focus group discussion with project stakeholders, exploring factors associated with successful implementation and sustainment of these interventions. RESULTS: The development of the customized CFIR is finalized and currently is in pilot testing. The initial results of the use of the tool in those 13 implementations will be available in 2019. Continuous conference and peer- reviewed publications will be published in the coming years. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will provide an in-depth understanding of individual, organizational, and external level factors that influence the successful implementation of mHealth in different health systems and geographic contexts over time. Via the tool's unique scoring system connected to qualitative descriptors, these data will inform the most critical implementation targets and contribute to the tailoring of strategies that will assist the health system in overcoming barriers to implementation, and ultimately, improve treatment adherence and engagement in care.

The role of digital health for post-surgery care of older patients with hip fracture: A scoping review,"Zhang J, Yang M, Ge Y, Ivers R, Webster R, Tian M.",Int J Med Inform. 2022 Apr;160:104709. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104709. Epub 2022 Feb 5.,Zhang J,Int J Med Inform,2022,2022/02/10,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104709,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions can potentially improve the integration of the health care systems. Hip fracture is a serious injury for older people and integrated post-surgery care is vital for good recovery. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterise digital health interventions used for hip fracture post-surgery care, and further to examine the extent to which of these interventions address the World Health Organisation (WHO) integrated care for older people (ICOPE) framework. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted, by searching the literature from English and Chinese databases and trial registries. Keywords included hip fracture, post-surgery care and digital health interventions. Interventional, observational, qualitative studies and case reports were included. We used a combined framework, WHO ICOPE and WHO digital health intervention classifications, to support data synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 4,542 articles were identified, of which 39 studies were included in the analysis. We identified only six randomised controlled trials. Digital health interventions were mainly used to help doctors provide clinical care and facilitate service delivery between the patients and healthcare providers. No studies focused on health workforce, financial policy or the development of infrastructure. The primary users were healthcare providers and patients, without healthcare managers or the use of data services. Most digital health interventions focused on physical therapy, bone protection and falls prevention. Limited interventions were implemented in low-and middle-income countries. CONCLUSION: A stronger evidence base is needed to expand the use of digital health for post-surgery care of hip fracture patients, including high-quality larger-scale studies, more focus in resource-constrained settings, expanding to more users and capabilities of interventions, and exploring the role of digital health for the integrated care model to mitigate health system challenges."

To address this issue, it is necessary to summarize the design features that improve user engagement based on research over the past 10 years, during which time the popularity of mHealth interventions has rapidly increased due to the use of smartphones. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to answer the question ""Which design features improve user engagement with mHealth interventions?"" by summarizing published literature with the purpose of guiding the design of future mHealth interventions. METHODS: This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid EMBASE, and Ovid PsycINFO, were searched for English and Chinese language papers published from January 2009 to June 2019. Thematic analysis was undertaken to assess the design features in eligible studies. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess study quality. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were included. The investigated mHealth interventions were mainly used in unhealthy lifestyle (n=17) and chronic disease (n=10) prevention programs. Mobile phone apps (n=24) were the most common delivery method. Qualitative (n=22) and mixed methods (n=9) designs were widely represented. We identified the following 7 themes that influenced user engagement: personalization (n=29), reinforcement (n=23), communication (n=20), navigation (n=17), credibility (n=16), message presentation (n=16), and interface aesthetics (n=7). A checklist was developed that contained these 7 design features and 29 corresponding specific implementations derived from the studies. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and thematic synthesis identified useful design features that make an mHealth intervention more user friendly. We generated a checklist with evidence-based items to enable developers to use our findings easily. Future evaluations should use more robust quantitative approaches to elucidate the relationships between design features and user engagement."

One promising pathway for improving dietary adherence is targeting grocery shopping habits. Interventions might facilitate healthy grocery choices, with a combination of mHealth and traditional methods, by promoting the salience of dietary goals while shopping, enhancing motivation to make dietary changes, and increasing household support for healthy food purchasing. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study will assess feasibility and acceptability of intervention components designed to improve adherence to dietary guidelines for cancer prevention (preliminary aim). The primary aim of the study is to quantify the effect of each intervention component, individually and in combination, on dietary intake (primary aim) and grocery store food purchases (exploratory aim). Mediation analyses will be conducted to understand the mechanisms of action (goal salience, motivation, and household support-secondary aims). The overarching goal is to optimize an mHealth intervention to be tested in a future fully powered clinical trial. METHODS: The study enrolled adults (N=62) with low adherence to dietary recommendations for cancer prevention. In a 20-week program, all participants attend a nutrition education workshop and receive weekly educational messages through an app. A factorial design is used to test 4 intervention components: (1) location-triggered messages: educational messages are delivered when arriving at grocery stores; (2) reflections on the benefits of change: content is added to messages to encourage reflection on anticipated benefits of healthy eating, and participants attend an additional workshop session and 3 coach calls on this topic; (3) coach monitoring: food purchases are monitored digitally by a coach who sends personalized weekly app messages and conducts 3 coaching calls that focus on feedback about purchases; and (4) household support: another adult in the household receives messages designed to elicit support for healthy food purchasing, and support is addressed in 3 coach calls and an extra workshop session attended by the index participant and household member. Assessments are completed at weeks 0, 10, and 20 using self-report measures, as well as objective capture of grocery data from the point of purchase using store loyalty accounts. RESULTS: The National Cancer Institute funded this study (R21CA252933) on July 7, 2020. Participant recruitment began in the spring of 2021 and concluded with the successful enrollment of 62 participants. Data collection is expected to be completed in the summer of 2022, and results are expected to be disseminated in the summer of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study will inform the development of scalable interventions to lower cancer risk via changes in dietary intake.

We present a health system-based intervention with diverse patient populations using readily available smartphone technology. This intervention is designed to empower patients and create partnerships between patients and their provider team to promote hypertension control. OBJECTIVE: The mGlide randomized controlled trial is a National Institutes of Health-funded study, evaluating whether a mobile health (mHealth)-based intervention that is an active partnership between interprofessional health care teams and patients results in better hypertension control rates than a state-of-clinical care comparison. METHODS: We are recruiting 450 participants including stroke survivors and primary care patients with elevated cardiovascular disease risk from diverse health systems. These systems include an acute stroke service (n=100), an academic medical center (n=150), and community medical centers including Federally Qualified Health Centers serving low-income and minority (Latino, Hmong, African American, Somali) patients (n=200). The primary aim tests the clinical effectiveness of the 6-month mHealth intervention versus standard of care. Secondary aims evaluate sustained hypertension control rates at 12 months; describe provider experiences of system usability and satisfaction; examine patient experiences, including medication adherence and medication use self-efficacy, self-rated health and quality of life, and adverse event rates; and complete a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: To date, we have randomized 107 participants (54 intervention, 53 control). CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide evidence for whether a readily available mHealth care model is better than state-of-clinical care for bridging the guideline-to-practice gap in hypertension treatment in health systems serving diverse patient populations.

An mHealth Intervention to Improve Guardians' Adherence to Children's Follow-Up Care for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Tanzania (GuardiansCan Project): Protocol for a Development and Feasibility Study,"Chiwanga FS, Woodford J, Masika GM, Richards DA, Savi V, von Essen L.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Aug 2;12:e48799. doi: 10.2196/48799.,Chiwanga FS,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/07/05,PMC10433028,,10.2196/48799,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death during childhood and in low- and middle-income countries survival rates can be as low as 20%. A leading reason for low childhood cancer survival rates in low- and middle-income countries such as Tanzania is treatment abandonment. Contributing factors include poor communication between health care providers and children's guardians, insufficient cancer knowledge, and psychological distress. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to respond to Tanzanian guardians' poor adherence to children's follow-up care after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the help of mobile health (mHealth) technology. Our goal is to increase guardians' adherence to children's medications and follow-up visits and to decrease their psychological distress. METHODS: Following the Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions, we will undertake the GuardiansCan project in an iterative phased approach to develop an mHealth intervention for subsequent testing. Public contribution activities will be implemented throughout via the establishment of a Guardians Advisory Board consisting of guardians of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We will examine the acceptability, feasibility, and perceived impact of Guardians Advisory Board activities via an impact log and semistructured interviews (study I). In phase 1 (intervention development) we will explore guardians' needs and preferences for the provision of follow-up care reminders, information, and emotional support using focus group discussions and photovoice (study II). We will then co-design the mHealth intervention with guardians, health care professionals, and technology experts using participatory action research (study III). In phase 2 (feasibility), we will examine clinical, methodological, and procedural uncertainties associated with the intervention and study procedures to prepare for the design and conduct of a future definitive randomized controlled trial using a single-arm pre-post mixed methods feasibility study (study IV). RESULTS: Data collection for the GuardiansCan project is anticipated to take 3 years. We plan to commence study I by recruiting Guardians Advisory Board members in the autumn of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: By systematically following the intervention development and feasibility phases of the Medical Research Council Framework, and working alongside an advisory board of guardians, we intend to develop an acceptable, culturally appropriate, feasible, and relevant mHealth intervention with the potential to increase guardians' adherence to children's follow-up care after treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, leading to a positive impact on children's health and chances to survive, and reducing distress for guardians.

We identified 25 studies (17 randomized controlled trials and 8 pre-post design studies; 957 patients) that evaluated mHealth interventions. The most commonly studied mHealth interventions included physical activity/ fitness interventions (9 studies), cognitive behavioral therapy (6 studies), mindfulness/ stress management (3 studies). In the majority of studies, mHealth interventions were associated with an improved HRQoL of cancer patients. The meta-analysis of the identified studies supported the positive effect of mHealth interventions for HRQoL of cancer patients. mHealth interventions are promising for improving HRQoL of cancer patients."
Digital Health Technologies for Maternal and Child Health in Africa and Other Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Cross-disciplinary Scoping Review With Stakeholder Consultation,"Till S, Mkhize M, Farao J, Shandu LD, Muthelo L, Coleman TL, Mbombi M, Bopape M, Klingberg S, van Heerden A, Mothiba T, Densmore M, Verdezoto Dias NX; CoMaCH Network.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Apr 7;25:e42161. doi: 10.2196/42161.,Till S,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/04/07,PMC10131761,,10.2196/42161,"BACKGROUND: Maternal and child health (MCH) is a global health concern, especially impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Digital health technologies are creating opportunities to address the social determinants of MCH by facilitating access to information and providing other forms of support throughout the maternity journey. Previous reviews in different disciplines have synthesized digital health intervention outcomes in LMIC. However, contributions in this space are scattered across publications in different disciplines and lack coherence in what digital MCH means across fields. OBJECTIVE: This cross-disciplinary scoping review synthesized the existing published literature in 3 major disciplines on the use of digital health interventions for MCH in LMIC, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using the 6-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley across 3 disciplines, including public health, social sciences applied to health, and human-computer interaction research in health care. We searched the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and PLOS. A stakeholder consultation was undertaken to inform and validate the review. RESULTS: During the search, 284 peer-reviewed articles were identified. After removing 41 duplicates, 141 articles met our inclusion criteria: 34 from social sciences applied to health, 58 from public health, and 49 from human-computer interaction research in health care. These articles were then tagged (labeled) by 3 researchers using a custom data extraction framework to obtain the findings. First, the scope of digital MCH was found to target health education (eg, breastfeeding and child nutrition), care and follow-up of health service use (to support community health workers), maternal mental health, and nutritional and health outcomes. These interventions included mobile apps, SMS text messaging, voice messaging, web-based applications, social media, movies and videos, and wearable or sensor-based devices. Second, we highlight key challenges: little attention has been given to understanding the lived experiences of the communities; key role players (eg, fathers, grandparents, and other family members) are often excluded; and many studies are designed considering nuclear families that do not represent the family structures of the local cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Digital MCH has shown steady growth in Africa and other LMIC settings. Unfortunately, the role of the community was negligible, as these interventions often do not include communities early and inclusively enough in the design process. We highlight key opportunities and sociotechnical challenges for digital MCH in LMIC, such as more affordable mobile data; better access to smartphones and wearable technologies; and the rise of custom-developed, culturally appropriate apps that are more suited to low-literacy users. We also focus on barriers such as an overreliance on text-based communications and the difficulty of MCH research and design to inform and translate into policy."
Feasibility and utility of mobile health interventions for depression and anxiety in rural populations: A scoping review,"McCarthy MJ, Wicker A, Roddy J, Remiker M, Roy I, McCoy M, Cerino ES, Baldwin J.",Internet Interv. 2024 Feb 3;35:100724. doi: 10.1016/j.invent.2024.100724. eCollection 2024 Mar.,McCarthy MJ,Internet Interv,2024,2024/02/14,PMC10863305,,10.1016/j.invent.2024.100724,"Despite the potential of mobile health (mHealth) to address high rates of depression and anxiety in underserved rural communities, most mHealth interventions do not explicitly consider the realities of rural life. The aim of this scoping review is to identify and examine the available literature on mHealth interventions that consider the needs of rural populations in order to gauge their feasibility and utility for addressing depression and anxiety. Additionally, we provide an overview of rural users' perceptions about and preferences for mHealth-delivered mental health screening and intervention systems. Out of 169 articles identified, 16 met inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted across a wide range of countries, age groups, and rural subpopulations including individuals with bipolar disorder, anxiety, perinatal depression, PTSD, and chronic pain, as well as refugees, veterans, and transgender and LGBTQ+ individuals. All interventions were in the feasibility/acceptability testing stage for rural users. Identified strengths included their simplicity, accessibility, convenience, availability of support between sessions with providers, and remote access to a care team. Weaknesses included problems with charging phone batteries and exceeding data limits, privacy concerns, and general lack of comfort with app-based support. Based upon this review, we provide recommendations for future mHealth intervention development including the value of developer-user coproduction methods, the need to consider user variation in access to and comfort with smartphones, and potential data or connectivity limitations, mental health stigma, and confidentiality concerns in rural communities."

Digital technologies are increasingly being deployed in the workplace to measure and modify office workers' SBs. However, knowledge of the range and nature of research on this topic is limited; it also remains unclear to what extent digital interventions have exploited the technological possibilities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the technological landscape of digital interventions for SB reduction in office workers and to map the research activity in this field. METHODS: Terms related to SB, office worker, and digital technology were applied in various combinations to search Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Scopus, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Engineering index Compendex, and Google Scholar for the years 2000 to 2017. Data regarding the study and intervention details were extracted. Interventions and studies were categorized into development, feasibility and/piloting, evaluation, or implementation phase based on the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions. A novel framework was developed to classify technological features and annotate technological configurations. A mix of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used to summarize data. RESULTS: We identified 68 articles describing 45 digital interventions designed to intervene with office workers' SB. A total of 6 common technological features had been applied to interventions with various combinations. Configurations such as ""information delivery and mediated organizational and social support"" and ""digital log and automated tailored feedback"" were well established in evaluation and implementation studies; in contrast, the integration of passive data collection, connected devices, and ATF or scheduled prompts was mostly present in development and piloting research. CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first to map and describe the use of digital technologies in research on SB reduction in office workers. Interdisciplinary collaborations can help to maximize the potential of technologies. As novel modes of delivery that capitalize on embedded computing and electronics, wireless technologies have been developed and piloted in engineering, computing, and design fields, efforts can be directed to move them to the next phase of evaluation with more rigorous study designs. Quality of research may be improved by fostering conversations between different research communities and encouraging researchers to plan, conduct, and report their research under the MRC framework. This review will be particularly informative to those deciding on areas where further research or development is needed and to those looking to locate the relevant expertise, resources, and design inputs when designing their own systems or interventions."
What Works and What Doesn't Work? A Systematic Review of Digital Mental Health Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Young People,"Garrido S, Millington C, Cheers D, Boydell K, Schubert E, Meade T, Nguyen QV.",Front Psychiatry. 2019 Nov 13;10:759. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00759. eCollection 2019.,Garrido S,Front Psychiatry,2019,2019/12/05,PMC6865844,,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00759,"Background: A major challenge in providing mental health interventions for young people is making such interventions accessible and appealing to those most in need. Online and app-based forms of therapy for mental health are burgeoning. It is therefore crucial to identify features that are most effective and engaging for young users. Objectives: This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of digital mental health interventions and their effectiveness in addressing anxiety and depression in young people to determine factors that relate to outcomes, adherence, and engagement with such interventions. Methods: A mixed methods approach was taken, including a meta-analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials that compared use of a digital intervention for depression in young people to a no-intervention control group, and 6 comparing the intervention to an active control condition. A thematic analysis and narrative synthesis of 41 studies was also performed. Results: The pooled effect size of digital mental health interventions on depression in comparison to a no-intervention control was small (Cohen's d = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55), while the pooled effect size of studies comparing an intervention group to an active control showed no significant differences (Cohen's d = 0.14, 95% CI -.04 to 0.31). Pooled effect sizes were higher when supervision was involved (studies with no-intervention controls: Cohen's d = 0.52, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.80; studies with active control: Cohen's d = 0.49, 95% CI -0.11, 1.01). Engagement and adherence rates were low. Qualitative analysis revealed that users liked interventions with a game-like feel and relatable, interactive content. Educational materials were perceived as boring, and users were put off by non-appealing interfaces and technical glitches. Conclusions: Digital interventions work better than no intervention to improve depression in young people when results of different studies are pooled together. However, these interventions may only be of clinical significance when use is highly supervised. Digital interventions do not work better than active alternatives regardless of the level of support. Future interventions need to move beyond the use of digital educational materials, considering other ways to attract and engage young people and to ensure relevance and appeal."
Increasing HIV Testing and Viral Suppression via Stigma Reduction in a Social Networking Mobile Health Intervention Among Black and Latinx Young Men and Transgender Women Who Have Sex With Men (HealthMpowerment): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Muessig KE, Golinkoff JM, Hightow-Weidman LB, Rochelle AE, Mulawa MI, Hirshfield S, Rosengren AL, Aryal S, Buckner N, Wilson MS, Watson DL, Houang S, Bauermeister JA.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Dec 16;9(12):e24043. doi: 10.2196/24043.,Muessig KE,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/12/16,PMC7773515,,10.2196/24043,"BACKGROUND: Stigma and discrimination related to sexuality, race, ethnicity, and HIV status negatively impact HIV testing, engagement in care, and consistent viral suppression (VS) among young Black and Latinx men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men (YBLMT). Few interventions address the effects of intersectional stigma among youth living with HIV and those at risk for HIV within the same virtual space. OBJECTIVE: Building on the success of the HealthMpowerment (HMP) mobile health (mHealth) intervention (HMP 1.0) and with the input of a youth advisory board, HMP 2.0 is an app-based intervention that promotes user-generated content and social support to reduce intersectional stigma and improve HIV-related outcomes among YBLMT. The primary objective of this study is to test whether participants randomized to HMP 2.0 report improvement in HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes compared with an information-only control arm. We will also explore whether participant engagement, as measured by paradata (data collected as users interact with an mHealth intervention, eg, time spent using the intervention), mediates stigma- and HIV care-related outcomes. Finally, we will assess whether changes in intersectional stigma and improvements in HIV care continuum outcomes vary across different types of social networks formed within the intervention study arms. METHODS: We will enroll 1050 YBLMT aged 15 to 29 years affected by HIV across the United States. Using an HIV-status stratified, randomized trial design, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 app-based conditions (information-only app-based control arm, a researcher-created network arm of HMP 2.0, or a peer-referred network arm of HMP 2.0). Behavioral assessments will occur at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. For participants living with HIV, self-collected biomarkers (viral load) are scheduled for baseline, 6, and 12 months. For HIV-negative participants, up to 3 HIV self-testing kits will be available during the study period. RESULTS: Research activities began in September 2018 and are ongoing. The University of Pennsylvania is the central institutional review board for this study (protocol #829805) with institutional reliance agreements with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, and SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University. Study recruitment began on July 20, 2020. A total of 205 participants have been enrolled as of November 20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Among a large sample of US-based YBLMT, this study will assess whether HMP 2.0, an app-based intervention designed to ameliorate stigma and its negative sequelae, can increase routine HIV testing among HIV-negative participants and consistent VS among participants living with HIV. If efficacious and brought to scale, this intervention has the potential to significantly impact the disproportionate burden of HIV among YBLMT in the United States.

A Web-Based Intervention for Young Adults Whose Parents Have a Mental Illness or Substance Use Concern: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Maybery D, Reupert A, Bartholomew C, Cuff R, Duncan Z, Foster K, Matar J, Pettenuzzo L.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Jun 18;9(6):e15626. doi: 10.2196/15626.,Maybery D,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/06/20,PMC7333071,,10.2196/15626,"BACKGROUND: One in 5 young people grow up in a family where one parent has experienced a mental health problem or substance use concern. Compared with their same-aged peers, these youth are at a higher risk of academic failure and acquiring a substance abuse and/or mental health issue. There is a paucity of accessible, age-appropriate interventions that address their needs. OBJECTIVE: A 6-week, web-based intervention, ""mental illness: supported, preventative, online, targeted"" (mi.spot), was developed based on previous research and the competence enhancement model. This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial and details how the usage, safety, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention will be determined. METHODS: Participants will be recruited through social media and clinician referral. A total of 70 Australians, aged 18 to 25 years, who grew up with parents with a mental illness or substance use concern will participate in a 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial. The assessment will consist of a baseline measurement and 2 follow-up periods, posttest and 6-week follow-up, using the Mental Health Continuum short form; the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory; the General Help Seeking Questionnaire; the Social Connectedness Scale; the Mental Health Literacy Scale; the General Self-Efficacy Scale; and the Attribution of Responsibility for Parental Mental Illness Measure. Impact will be examined at pre, post, and follow-up time periods using analyses of variance that will include a within-subjects factor (time) and a between-subjects factor (intervention/control). Facilitator interviews will ascertain intervention feasibility. Participant interviews will ascertain intervention acceptability. Interview data will be analyzed within a qualitative framework. Usage (data analytics) across site features and several indicators of clinical safety will also be reported. RESULTS: The impact of mi.spot will be examined at pre, post, and follow-up time periods using analyses of variance on each of the measures outlined above. There will be a within-subjects factor (time) and a between-subjects factor (intervention/control). Data analysis will employ the intention-to-treat principle by including all participants in the analyses. Qualitative interview data will be analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis along with respondent validation. The Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (reference number: 2019-18660-30434) approved the trial on April 17, 2019. As of October 2, 2019, 30 participants were enrolled in the control group and 34 participants were enrolled in the intervention group. Result are expected to be submitted for publication in December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Study results will provide reliable evidence on a web-based intervention that has the potential to make a difference to the lives of many vulnerable young adults. Implementation guidelines are needed to embed the intervention in different service sectors.

mHealth Interventions to Address Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior in Cancer Survivors: A Systematic Review,"Khoo S, Mohbin N, Ansari P, Al-Kitani M, Müller AM.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 May 28;18(11):5798. doi: 10.3390/ijerph18115798.,Khoo S,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2021,2021/06/02,PMC8198944,,10.3390/ijerph18115798,"This review aimed to identify, evaluate, and synthesize the scientific literature on mobile health (mHealth) interventions to promote physical activity (PA) or reduce sedentary behavior (SB) in cancer survivors. We searched six databases from 2000 to 13 April 2020 for controlled and non-controlled trials published in any language. We conducted best evidence syntheses on controlled trials to assess the strength of the evidence. All 31 interventions included in this review measured PA outcomes, with 10 of them also evaluating SB outcomes. Most study participants were adults/older adults with various cancer types. The majority (n = 25) of studies implemented multicomponent interventions, with activity trackers being the most commonly used mHealth technology. There is strong evidence for mHealth interventions, including personal contact components, in increasing moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA among cancer survivors. However, there is inconclusive evidence to support mHealth interventions in increasing total activity and step counts. There is inconclusive evidence on SB potentially due to the limited number of studies. mHealth interventions that include personal contact components are likely more effective in increasing PA than mHealth interventions without such components. Future research should address social factors in mHealth interventions for PA and SB in cancer survivors."
Digital intervention in improving the outcomes of mental health among LGBTQ+ youth: a systematic review,"Liu Y, Wu YC, Fu H, Guo WY, Wang X.",Front Psychol. 2023 Sep 22;14:1242928. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1242928. eCollection 2023.,Liu Y,Front Psychol,2023,2023/10/09,PMC10556462,,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1242928,"LGBTQ+ youth experience mental health disparities and higher rates of mental disorders due to barriers to accessing care, including insufficient services and the anticipated stigma of revealing their identities. This systematic review incorporated 15 empirical studies on digital interventions' impact on LGBTQ+ youth mental health, examining their potential to address these inequities. This study innovatively categorized existing digital interventions into four streams: Structured Formal (telehealth, online programs), Structured Informal (serious games), Unstructured Formal (mobile applications), and Unstructured Informal (social media). We found that S&F and U&F effectively reduced symptoms. U&F showed potential but required enhancement, while U&I fostered resilience but posed risks. Further integration of emerging technologies like virtual reality may strengthen these interventions. This review identifies the characteristics of effective digital health interventions and evaluates the overall potential of digital technologies in improving LGBTQ+ youth mental health, uniquely contributing insights on digital solutions advancing LGBTQ+ youth mental healthcare."
Mobile technologies for rehabilitation in non-specific spinal disorders: a systematic review of the efficacy and potential for implementation in low- and middle-income countries,"Mitchaï PM, Mapinduzi J, Verbrugghe J, Michiels S, Janssens L, Kossi O, Bonnechère B, Timmermans A.",Eur Spine J. 2023 Dec;32(12):4077-4100. doi: 10.1007/s00586-023-07964-2. Epub 2023 Oct 4.,Mitchaï PM,Eur Spine J,2023,2023/10/04,,,10.1007/s00586-023-07964-2,"PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic review was primarily to identify the types of mHealth technologies for the rehabilitation of non-specific spinal disorders, second to evaluate their efficacy, and finally to determine their applicability in LMICs. METHODS: Three databases (Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science) were searched for randomized controlled trials and clinical trials from January 2012 until December 2022. Studies were found eligible when using mHealth technologies for the rehabilitation of non-specific spinal disorders. To evaluate efficacy, the primary outcome was pain intensity, and the secondary outcomes were disability and quality of life. To evaluate the applicability in LMICs, information about financial and geographical accessibility, offline usability, and languages was extracted. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included comprising 1828 participants who suffer from non-specific low back pain (86.05%) and non-specific neck pain (13.95%). Fourteen distinct smartphone-based interventions and two sensor system interventions were found, with a duration ranging from four weeks to six months. All mHealth interventions demonstrated efficacy for the improvement of pain, disability and quality of life in non-specific spinal disorders, particularly low back pain. Five of the evaluated smartphone applications were free of charge accessible and had language features that could be adapted for use in LMICs. CONCLUSION: mHealth interventions can be used and integrated into the conventional treatment of non-specific spinal disorders in rehabilitation. They have demonstrated efficacy and could be implemented in LMICs with minor adaptations to overcome language barriers and the absolute necessity of the internet."

This systematic review examines app-based interventions with social support components for cancer patients, investigating the use of different support functions from different sources and the impact on cancer-related symptoms and psychological outcomes. A systematic search across five databases (EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science) yielded 449 records, of which 17 studies (12 controlled designs) were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality, revealing a high risk of bias across studies. Social support was implemented through different app functions, including contact/chat functions (n = 9), automatic alerts based on app input (n = 6) and discussion forums (n = 5). Social support predominantly focused on informational support (n = 17), mostly from healthcare professionals. Emotional support was less common (n = 7). Results indicated some promising intervention effects for pain, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, insomnia, constipation and overall symptom distress, but heterogeneous effects for health-related quality of life. Overall, results were mixed, but indicate that mobile apps incorporating social support may hold promise for cancer patients. However, future studies should focus on measuring and reporting social support as an intervention mechanism to systematically investigate its specific impact and improve effectiveness.HighlightsApps for cancer patients predominantly include informational social supportEmotional social support is substantially less frequently includedApps focus on formal support sources like healthcare professionalsFirst results are somewhat promising for improving cancer-related symptoms."
Effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for university students: an umbrella review,"Harith S, Backhaus I, Mohbin N, Ngo HT, Khoo S.",PeerJ. 2022 Mar 31;10:e13111. doi: 10.7717/peerj.13111. eCollection 2022.,Harith S,PeerJ,2022,2022/04/06,PMC8977068,,10.7717/peerj.13111,"BACKGROUND: Poor mental health among university students remains a pressing public health issue. Over the past few years, digital health interventions have been developed and considered promising in increasing psychological wellbeing among university students. Therefore, this umbrella review aims to synthesize evidence on digital health interventions targeting university students and to evaluate their effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in April 2021 searching PubMed, Psychology and Behavioural Science Collection, Web of Science, ERIC, and Scopus for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting university students. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO [CRD42021234773]. RESULTS: The initital literature search resulted in 806 records of which seven remained after duplicates were removed and evaluated against the inclusion criteria. Effectiveness was reported and categorized into the following six delivery types: (a) web-based, online/computer-delivered interventions (b) computer-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), (c) mobile applications and short message service (d) virtual reality interventions (e) skills training (f) relaxation and exposure-based therapy. Results indicated web-based online/computer delivered-interventions were effective or at least partially effective at decressing depression, anxiety, stress and eating disorder symptoms. This was similar for skills-training interventions, CBT-based intervention and mobile applications. However, digital mental health interventions using virtual reality and relaxation, exposure-based therapy was inconclusive. Due to the variation in study settings and inconsistencies in reporting, effectiveness was greatly dependent on the delivery format, targeted mental health problem and targeted purpose group. CONCLUSION: The findings provide evidence for the beneficial effect of digital mental health interventions for university students. However, this review calls for a more systematic approach in testing and reporting the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions."

Seven health factors are associated with ideal cardiovascular health: being a non-smoker; not overweight; physically active; having a healthy diet; and normal blood pressure; fasting plasma glucose and cholesterol. Whereas approximately half of U.S. youth have ideal levels in at least 5 of the 7 components of cardiovascular health, this proportion falls to 16% by adulthood. OBJECTIVE: We will evaluate whether the NUYou cardiovascular mHealth intervention is more effective than an active comparator to promote cardiovascular health during the transition to young adulthood. METHODS: 302 incoming freshmen at a midwest university will be cluster randomized by dormitory into one of two mHealth intervention groups: 1) Cardiovascular Health (CVH), addressing behaviors related to CVD risk; or 2) Whole Health (WH), addressing behaviors unrelated to CVD. Both groups will receive smartphone applications, co-designed with students to help them manage time, interact with other participants via social media, and report health behaviors weekly. The CVH group will also have self-monitoring features to track their risk behaviors. Cardiovascular health will be assessed at the beginning of freshman year and the end of freshman and sophomore years. Linear mixed models will be used to compare groups on a composite of the seven cardiovascular-related health factors. SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first entirely technology-mediated multiple health behavior change intervention delivered to college students to promote cardiovascular health. Findings will inform the potential for primordial prevention in young adulthood. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: clinicaltrials.gov #NCT02496728."

Recently, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for the development of intelligent mobile health (mHealth) interventions for chronic diseases that could revolutionize the delivery of health care anytime, anywhere. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to present a systematic review of studies that have used DL based on mHealth data for the diagnosis, prognosis, management, and treatment of major chronic diseases and advance our understanding of the progress made in this rapidly developing field. METHODS: A search was conducted on the bibliographic databases Scopus and PubMed to identify papers with a focus on the deployment of DL algorithms that used data captured from mobile devices (eg, smartphones, smartwatches, and other wearable devices) targeting CVD, diabetes, or cancer. The identified studies were synthesized according to the target disease, the number of enrolled participants and their age, and the study period as well as the DL algorithm used, the main DL outcome, the data set used, the features selected, and the achieved performance. RESULTS: In total, 20 studies were included in the review. A total of 35% (7/20) of DL studies targeted CVD, 45% (9/20) of studies targeted diabetes, and 20% (4/20) of studies targeted cancer. The most common DL outcome was the diagnosis of the patient's condition for the CVD studies, prediction of blood glucose levels for the studies in diabetes, and early detection of cancer. Most of the DL algorithms used were convolutional neural networks in studies on CVD and cancer and recurrent neural networks in studies on diabetes. The performance of DL was found overall to be satisfactory, reaching >84% accuracy in most studies. In comparison with classic machine learning approaches, DL was found to achieve better performance in almost all studies that reported such comparison outcomes. Most of the studies did not provide details on the explainability of DL outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DL can facilitate the diagnosis, management, and treatment of major chronic diseases by harnessing mHealth data. Prospective studies are now required to demonstrate the value of applied DL in real-life mHealth tools and interventions."

TBI can lead to significant motor, cognitive and emotional deficits. Mobile health (mHealth) is a promising technology to help diagnose and manage patients with TBI. The aim of this study was to systematically examine and classify available TBI mobile applications (apps) and critically appraise the literature underpinning mHealth for the management of TBI. Two major app markets (Apple and Google Play) were systematically searched. Included apps were classified and had data extracted. Coupled to this, a systematic search of the literature (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO) was performed examining the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in helping patients manage their symptoms after TBI (registered with PROSPERO: CRD42018107386). From 1296 apps, 53 met our inclusion criteria. The top three functions were TBI screening, education and biomechanics monitoring. Twenty-six apps (49.1%) focused on sports-related concussion. Eight apps (15.1%) were gamified and 12 apps (22.6%) connected to an external device. From the literature, a total of eight articles were included of which four (50%) were case series, two (25%) were feasibility/pilot studies, one (12.5%) was a case report, and one (12.5%) was a randomised controlled trial. The median number of patients was seven (1 - 43). There is a small number of mobile apps for TBI, mostly focusing on sports-related concussion. At present, the uptake and application of these apps as a management aid is limited and the evidence for their usefulness in TBI remains low."
Effect of telehealth interventions on adherence to endocrine therapy among patients with breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Sun S, Zhang B, Zhang N, Zhang Y, Zhu M, Zhang M.",Support Care Cancer. 2024 Feb 9;32(3):151. doi: 10.1007/s00520-024-08339-z.,Sun S,Support Care Cancer,2024,2024/02/09,,,10.1007/s00520-024-08339-z,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of telehealth interventions on adherence to endocrine therapy among patients with breast cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of five English databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the American Psychological Association PsycNet, and the Cochrane Library) and four Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, SinoMed, WanFang Data, and WeiPu Data) was performed from inception to March 31, 2023. Two investigators independently screened the available studies for eligibility and extracted relevant data. Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The effect size was computed based on the risk ratio for dichotomous data and standardized mean difference for continuous data using Review Manager 5.4. RESULTS: A total of 1,780 participants from eight randomized controlled trials were included. These studies involved treatment with aromatase inhibitors only (n = 3) or aromatase inhibitors plus tamoxifen (n = 5). Telehealth interventions involved web-based interventions, telephone-based interventions, interventions via mobile applications, and interventions based on technology. In three studies, subjective measures were used, while objective measures were utilized in another three. Two studies incorporated a combination of both subjective and objective measures. The duration of the interventions varied among studies, ranging from a week to 36 months. The follow-up duration ranged from 4 weeks to 36 months. The quality of included studies was moderate to high. The meta-analysis of the five studies reporting dichotomous data showed that telehealth interventions had a significant effect on adherence to endocrine therapy (RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.76-0.97). Moreover, four studies reported continuous data. The meta-analysis demonstrated that telehealth interventions significantly improved adherence to endocrine therapy at 1 month (SMD = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.10-0.90), 3 months (SMD = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.17-0.99), and 6 months (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.08-0.47) of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Telehealth interventions may facilitate adherence to endocrine therapy among patients with breast cancer. Further research should adopt a theory-based design and explore the longer-term effects."

METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, comprised of adults (>/=18 years old) with hypertension and the intervention consisted of digital health interventions according to WHO's classifications for patients in LMICs between January 1, 2009, and July 17, 2023. We excluded RCTs that considered patients with hypertension comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension-mediated target organ damage (HMTOD). The references were downloaded into Mendeley Desktop and imported into the Rayyan web tool for deduplication and screening. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2. Data extraction was done according to Cochrane's guidelines. The main outcome measures were mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and BP control which were assessed using the random-effect DerSimonian-Laird and Mantel-Haenszel models. We presented the BP outcomes, lifestyle behaviour changes and medication adherence in forest plots as well as summarized them in tables. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023424227. FINDINGS: We identified 9322 articles, of which 22 RCTs from 12 countries (n = 12,892 respondents) were included in the systematic review. The quality of the 22 studies was graded as high risk (n = 7), had some concerns (n = 3) and low risk of bias (n = 12). A total of 19 RCTs (n = 12,418 respondents) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, digital health intervention had significant reductions in SBP [mean difference (MD) = -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -6.19 to -2.67), I(2) = 92%] and BP control [odds ratio (OR) = 2.20 (95% CI 1.64-2.94), I(2) = 78%], respectively, compared with usual care. A subgroup analysis revealed that short message service (SMS) interventions had the greatest statistically significant reduction of SBP [MD = -5.75 mm Hg (95% Cl -7.77 to -3.73), I(2) = 86%] compared to mobile phone calls [MD = 3.08 mm Hg (-6.16 to 12.32), I(2) = 87%] or smartphone apps interventions [MD = -4.06 mm Hg (-6.56 to -1.55), I(2) = 79%], but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). The meta-analysis showed that the interventions had a significant effect in supporting changes in lifestyle behaviours related to a low salt diet [standardised mean difference (SMD) = 1.25; (95% CI 0.64-1.87), I(2) = 89%], physical activity [SMD = 1.30; (95% CI 0.23-2.37), I(2) = 94%] and smoking reduction [risk difference (RR) = 0.03; (95% CI 0.01-0.05), I(2) = 0%] compared to the control group. In addition, improvement in medication adherence was statistically significant and higher in the intervention group than in the control group [SMD = 1.59; (95% CI 0.51-2.67), I(2) = 97%]. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that digital health interventions may be effective for BP control, changes in lifestyle behaviours, and improvements in medication adherence in LMICs. However, we observed high heterogeneity between included studies, and only two studies from Africa were included. The combination of digital health interventions with clinical management is crucial to achieving optimal clinical effectiveness in BP control, changes in lifestyle behaviours and improvements in medication adherence.

Comparing Online and On-Site Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Major Depressive Disorder: Protocol for a Noninferiority Randomized Controlled Trial,"Ritvo P, Gratzer D, Knyahnytska Y, Ortiz A, Walters C, Katz J, Laposa J, Baldissera C, Wayne N, Pfefer-Litman D, Tomlinson G, Daskalakis Z.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Apr 8;11(4):e29726. doi: 10.2196/29726.,Ritvo P,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/04/08,PMC9022777,,10.2196/29726,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of mental health disorders in Canada is increasing with costs of CAD $51 billion (US $40 billion) per year. Depression is the most prevalent cause of disability while cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best validated behavioral depression treatment. CBT, when combined with mindfulness meditation (CBT-M), has strong evidence for increased efficacy. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated online CBT-M efficacy, comparisons with in-office delivery are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to assess whether online group CBT-M (with standard psychiatric care) is non-inferior in efficacy and more cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M at post-intervention and 6-months follow-up in major depressive disorder. The study will also assess whether digitally recorded data (ie, online workbooks completed, Fitbit step count, and online text messages) predict depression symptom reduction in online participants. METHODS: This single-center, two-arm, noninferiority RCT employs assessor-blinded and self-report outcomes and economic evaluation. The research site is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto), a research-based psychiatry institution where participants will be identified from service wait lists and through contacts with other Toronto clinics. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) aged 18-60 years, any ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) of mild severity (score >/=14) with no upper severity limit; (3) Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-confirmed, psychiatric major depressive disorder diagnosis; (4) fluent in English. All patients are diagnosed by staff psychiatrists. Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) receipt of weekly structured psychotherapy; (2) observation of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) criteria for severe alcohol or substance use disorder (in past 3 months), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia (or other primary psychotic disorder), bipolar disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder; (3) clinically significant suicidal ideation (imminent intent or attempted suicide in the past 6 months); and (4) treatment-resistant depression. All participants receive standard psychiatric care, experimental participants receive online group CBT-M, and controls receive standard care in-office group CBT-M. The online group program (in collaboration with NexJ Health, Inc) combines smartphone and computer-accessed workbooks with mental health phone counselling (16 hours in 16 weeks) that coordinates software interactions (eg, secure text messaging and Fitbit-tracked walking). The primary outcome is BDI-II, and secondary outcomes are anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (ie, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), quality of life (European Quality of Life Five Dimension), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory). RESULTS: Based on prior studies with the BDI-II and 80% power to reject an inferiority hypothesis with a 1-sided type I error rate of 5%, a sample of 78 per group is adequate to detect small-to-medium-effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: This study assesses online CBT-M efficacy and noninferiority in relation to in-person CBT, and the cost-effectiveness of both interventions.

Function and Emotion in Everyday Life With Type 1 Diabetes (FEEL-T1D): Protocol for a Fully Remote Intensive Longitudinal Study,"Pyatak EA, Hernandez R, Pham LT, Mehdiyeva K, Schneider S, Peters A, Ruelas V, Crandall J, Lee PJ, Jin H, Hoogendoorn CJ, Crespo-Ramos G, Mendez-Rodriguez H, Harmel M, Walker M, Serafin-Dokhan S, Gonzalez JS, Spruijt-Metz D.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Oct 22;10(10):e30901. doi: 10.2196/30901.,Pyatak EA,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/08/31,PMC8544739,,10.2196/30901,"BACKGROUND: Although short-term blood glucose levels and variability are thought to underlie diminished function and emotional well-being in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), these relationships are poorly understood. The Function and Emotion in Everyday Life with T1D (FEEL-T1D) study focuses on investigating these short-term dynamic relationships among blood glucose levels, functional ability, and emotional well-being in adults with T1D. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to present the FEEL-T1D study design, methods, and study progress to date, including adaptations necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic to implement the study fully remotely. METHODS: The FEEL-T1D study will recruit 200 adults with T1D in the age range of 18-75 years. Data collection includes a comprehensive survey battery, along with 14 days of intensive longitudinal data using blinded continuous glucose monitoring, ecological momentary assessments, ambulatory cognitive tasks, and accelerometers. All study procedures are conducted remotely by mailing the study equipment and by using videoconferencing for study visits. RESULTS: The study received institutional review board approval in January 2019 and was funded in April 2019. Data collection began in June 2020 and is projected to end in December 2021. As of June 2021, after 12 months of recruitment, 124 participants have enrolled in the FEEL-T1D study. Approximately 87.6% (7082/8087) of ecological momentary assessment surveys have been completed with minimal missing data, and 82.0% (82/100) of the participants provided concurrent continuous glucose monitoring data, ecological momentary assessment data, and accelerometer data for at least 10 of the 14 days of data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Thus far, our reconfiguration of the FEEL-T1D protocol to be implemented remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a success. The FEEL-T1D study will elucidate the dynamic relationships among blood glucose levels, emotional well-being, cognitive function, and participation in daily activities. In doing so, it will pave the way for innovative just-in-time interventions and produce actionable insights to facilitate tailoring of diabetes treatments to optimize the function and well-being of individuals with T1D.

Digital Health Interventions for Delivery of Mental Health Care: Systematic and Comprehensive Meta-Review,"Philippe TJ, Sikder N, Jackson A, Koblanski ME, Liow E, Pilarinos A, Vasarhelyi K.",JMIR Ment Health. 2022 May 12;9(5):e35159. doi: 10.2196/35159.,Philippe TJ,JMIR Ment Health,2022,2022/05/13,PMC9109782,,10.2196/35159,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted mental health care delivery to digital platforms, videoconferencing, and other mobile communications. However, existing reviews of digital health interventions are narrow in scope and focus on a limited number of mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-review of the literature to assess the state of digital health interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care. RESULTS: Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and >5% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health interventions offer promise in the treatment of mental health conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed. Additionally, evidence is needed on the effectiveness and appropriateness of digital health tools for patients who are marginalized and may lack access to digital health interventions."
mHealth Interventions to Promote Anti-Retroviral Adherence in HIV: Narrative Review,"Lee SB, Valerius J.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 Aug 28;8(8):e14739. doi: 10.2196/14739.,Lee SB,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/06/23,PMC7486676,,10.2196/14739,"BACKGROUND: Antiretrovirals (ARVs) are key in the management of HIV. Although no cure exists, ARVs help patients live healthy lives and prevent transmission to others. Adherence to complex regimens is paramount to outcomes and in avoiding the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. The goal of therapy is to reach an undetectable viral load. However, adherence is a common problem, stemming from issues such as mental health, chaotic home situations, and busy work schedules. Mobile health (mHealth) represents a new approach in improving medication adherence, and multiple studies have been performed in this area. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the current implementation of mHealth in the management of HIV among different groups of patients. METHODS: We used PubMed, Academic Search Elite, and 1 journal database with various search terms to review the current implementation of mHealth in HIV care. RESULTS: Titles and abstracts were screened, and 61 papers were identified and fully reviewed. The literature was divided into lower- and higher-income nations, as defined by the United Nations. A total of 20 studies with quantitative results were identified, with 10 being text- and SMS-based interventions (the majority of these being in lower-income countries) and 8 being smartphone-based apps (primarily in higher-income countries). The majority of these studies determined whether there was an effect on adherence or biochemical parameters (viral load and CD4 count). Various qualitative studies have also been conducted, and many have focused on determining the specific design of interventions that were successful (frequency of messaging, types of messages, etc) as well as priorities for patients with regard to mHealth interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be a role of mHealth in the management of HIV in lower-income nations; however, the optimal design of an intervention needs to be delineated. In higher-income countries, where the 2 significant risk factors were injection drugs and men who have sex with men, the benefit was less clear, and more research is needed."
"Age Unplugged: A Brief Narrative Review on the Intersection of Digital Tools, Sedentary and Physical Activity Behaviors in Community-Dwelling Older Adults","Ramalho A, Paulo R, Duarte-Mendes P, Serrano J, Petrica J.",Healthcare (Basel). 2024 May 1;12(9):935. doi: 10.3390/healthcare12090935.,Ramalho A,Healthcare (Basel),2024,2024/05/10,PMC11083116,,10.3390/healthcare12090935,"This brief narrative review assesses how digital technologies-such as wearables, mobile health apps, and various digital tools such as computers, game consoles, tablets, smartphones, and extended reality systems-can influence sedentary and physical activity behaviors among community-dwelling older adults. Each section highlights the central role of these technologies in promoting active aging through increased motivation, engagement and customized experiences. It underlines the critical importance of functionality, usability and adaptability of devices and confirms the effectiveness of digital interventions in increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior. The sustainable impact of these technologies needs to be further investigated, with a focus on adapting digital health strategies to the specific needs of older people. The research advocates an interdisciplinary approach and points out that such collaborations are essential for the development of accessible, effective and ethical solutions. This perspective emphasizes the potential of digital tools to improve the health and well-being of the aging population and recommends their strategic integration into health promotion and policy making."
Role of mHealth applications for improving antenatal and postnatal care in low and middle income countries: a systematic review,"Feroz A, Perveen S, Aftab W.",BMC Health Serv Res. 2017 Nov 7;17(1):704. doi: 10.1186/s12913-017-2664-7.,Feroz A,BMC Health Serv Res,2017,2017/11/09,PMC5678803,,10.1186/s12913-017-2664-7,"BACKGROUND: From 1990 to 2015, the number of maternal deaths globally has dropped by 43%. Despite this, progress in attaining MDG 5 is not remarkable in LMICs. Only 52% of pregnant women in LMICs obtain WHO recommended minimum of four antenatal consultations and the coverage of postnatal care is relatively poor. In recent years, the increased cellphone penetration has brought the potential for mHealth to improve preventive maternal healthcare services. The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of mHealth solutions on a range of maternal health outcomes by categorizing the interventions according to the types of mHealth applications. METHODS: Three international online electronic databases were searched between January 1, 2000 and January 25, 2016 to identify studies exploring the role of mHealth solutions in improving preventive maternal healthcare services. Of 1262 titles screened after duplication, 69 potentially relevant abstracts were obtained. Out of 69 abstracts, 42 abstracts were shortlisted. Full text of 42 articles was reviewed using data extraction sheet. A total of 14 full text studies were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: The 14 final studies were categorized in to five mHealth applications defined in the conceptual framework. Based on our analysis, the most reported use of mHealth was for client education and behavior change communication, such as SMS and voice reminders [n = 9, 65%]. The categorization provided the understanding that much work have been done on client education and behavior change communication. Most of the studies showed that mHealth interventions have proven to be effective to improve antenatal care and postnatal care services, especially those that are aimed at changing behavior of pregnant women and women in postnatal period. However, little evidence exists on other type of mHealth applications. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that mHealth solutions targeted at pregnant women and women in postnatal period can improve preventive maternal healthcare services. However, there is a need to conduct more controlled-trials and quasi-experimental studies to strengthen the literature in this research area. The review recommends that mHealth researchers, sponsors, and publishers should prioritize the transparent reporting of interventions to allow effective interpretation of extracted data."
Active Video Game Interventions Targeting Physical Activity Behaviors: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Moller AC, Sousa CV, Lee KJ, Alon D, Lu AS.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 May 16;25:e45243. doi: 10.2196/45243.,Moller AC,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/05/16,PMC10230359,,10.2196/45243,"BACKGROUND: Research on digital games designed to increase physical activity (PA), also known as exergames or active video games (AVGs), has proliferated over the past 2 decades. As a result, reviews of literature in this field can become outdated, revealing the need for updated high-quality reviews that identify overarching insights. Furthermore, given the significant heterogeneity in AVG research, study inclusion criteria may significantly influence conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, no prior systematic review or meta-analysis has specifically focused on studies of longitudinal AVG interventions targeting increases in PA behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain insights into when and why longitudinal AVG interventions are more or less successful for sustained increases in PA, especially for public health. METHODS: Six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were reviewed until December 31, 2020. This protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO: CRD42020204191). For inclusion, randomized controlled trials had to prominently (>50% of intervention) feature AVG technology, involve repeated AVG exposure, and target changes in PA behavior. Experimental designs had to include >/=2 within- or between-participant conditions with >/=10 participants per condition. RESULTS: A total of 25 studies published in English between 1996 and 2020 were identified, with 19 studies providing sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Our findings indicated that AVG interventions had a moderately positive effect, thereby increasing overall PA (Hedges g=0.525, 95% CI 0.322-0.728). Our analysis showed substantial heterogeneity (I(2)=87.7%; Q=154.1). The main findings were consistent across all subgroup analyses. The comparison between PA assessment type groups showed a moderate effect for objective measures (Hedges g=0.586, 95% CI 0.321-0.852) and a small effect for subjective measures (Hedges g=0.301, 95% CI 0.049-0.554) but no significant difference between the groups (P=.13). The platform subgroup analysis indicated a moderate effect for stepping devices (Hedges g=0.303, 95% CI 0.110-0.496), combination of handheld and body-sensing devices (Hedges g=0.512, 95% CI 0.288-0.736), and other devices (Hedges g=0.694, 95% CI 0.350-1.039). The type of control group showed a wide range of effects sizes, ranging from a small effect size (Hedges g=0.370, 95% CI 0.212-0.527) for the passive control group (nothing) to a moderate effect size for the conventional PA intervention group (Hedges g=0.693, 95% CI 0.107-1.279) and ultimately to a large effect size for sedentary game as control groups (Hedges g=0.932, 95% CI 0.043-1.821). There was no significant difference among the groups (P=.29). CONCLUSIONS: AVGs represent a promising tool for PA promotion among the general population and clinical subpopulations. However, significant variabilities in AVG quality, study design, and impact were also detected. Suggestions for improving AVG interventions and related research will be discussed.

Feasibility and Clinical Relevance of a Mobile Intervention Using TrackPAD to Support Supervised Exercise Therapy in Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial,"Paldán K, Simanovski J, Ullrich G, Steinmetz M, Rammos C, Jánosi RA, Moebus S, Rassaf T, Lortz J.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Jun 26;8(6):e13651. doi: 10.2196/13651.,Paldán K,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/06/28,PMC6617911,,10.2196/13651,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common and severe disease with a highly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Through the circulatory disorder and the linked undersupply of oxygen carriers in the lower limbs, the ongoing decrease of the pain-free walking distance occurs with a significant reduction in patients' quality of life. Studies including activity monitoring for patients with PAD are rare and digital support to increase activity via mobile health technologies is mainly targeted at patients with cardiovascular disease in general. The special requirement of patients with PAD is the need to reach a certain pain level to improve the pain-free walking distance. Unfortunately, both poor adherence and availability of institutional resources are major problems in patient-centered care. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this trackPAD pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of a mobile phone-based self tracking app to promote physical activity and supervised exercise therapy (SET) in particular. We also aim for a subsequent patient centered adjustment of the app prototype based on the results of the app evaluation and process evaluation. METHODS: This study was designed as a closed user group trial, with assessors blinded, and parallel group study with face-to-face components for assessment with a follow-up of 3 months. Patients with symptomatic PAD (Fontaine stage IIa or IIb) and possession of a mobile phone were eligible. Eligible participants were randomly assigned into study and control group, stratified by their distance covered in the 6-min walk test, using the software TENALEA. Participants randomized to the study group received usual care and the mobile intervention (trackPAD) for the follow-up period of 3 months, whereas participants randomized to the control group received only usual care. TrackPAD records the frequency and duration of training sessions and pain level using manual user input. Clinical outcome data were collected at the baseline and after 3 months via validated tools (6-min walk test, ankle-brachial index, and duplex ultrasound at the lower arteries) and self-reported quality of life. Usability and quality of the app was determined using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale. RESULTS: The study enrolled 45 participants with symptomatic PAD (44% male). Of these participants, 21 (47%) were randomized to the study group and 24 (53%) were randomized to the control group. The distance walked in the 6-min walk test was comparable in both groups at baseline (study group: mean 368.1m [SD 77.6] vs control group: mean 394.6m [SD 100.6]). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial to test a mobile intervention called trackPAD that was designed especially for patients with PAD. Its results will provide important insights in terms of feasibility, effectiveness, and patient preferences of an app-based mobile intervention supporting SET for the conservative treatment of PAD.

However, few attempts have been made to systematically review the mHealth programs targeted to improve young people SRH in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). This review aims to identify a range of different mHealth solutions that can be used for improving young people SRH in LMICs and highlight facilitators and barriers for adopting mHealth interventions designed to target SRH of young people. METHODS: Databases including PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Science Direct, Cochrane Central, and grey literature were searched between January 01, 2005 and March 31, 2020 to identify various types of mHealth interventions that are used to improve SRH services for young people in LMICs. Of 2948 titles screened after duplication, 374 potentially relevant abstracts were obtained. Out of 374 abstracts, 75 abstracts were shortlisted. Full text of 75 studies were reviewed using a pre-defined data extraction sheet. A total of 15 full-text studies were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: The final 15 studies were categorized into three main mHealth applications including client education and behavior change communication, data collection and reporting, and financial transactions and incentives. The most reported use of mHealth was for client education and behavior change communication [n = 14, 93%] followed by financial transactions and incentives, and data collection and reporting Little evidence exists on other types of mHealth applications described in Labrique et al. framework. Included studies evaluated the impact of mHealth interventions on access to SRH services (n = 9) and SRH outcomes (n = 6). mHealth interventions in included studies addressed barriers of provider prejudice, stigmatization, discrimination, fear of refusal, lack of privacy, and confidentiality. The studies also identified barriers to uptake of mHealth interventions for SRH including decreased technological literacy, inferior network coverage, and lower linguistic competency. CONCLUSION: The review provides detailed information about the implementation of mobile phones at different levels of the healthcare system for improving young people SRH outcomes. This systematic review recommends that barriers to uptake mHealth interventions be adequately addressed to increase the potential use of mobile phones for improving access to SRH awareness and services.

Mobile Phone-Based Behavioral Interventions in Pregnancy to Promote Maternal and Fetal Health in High-Income Countries: Systematic Review,"Hussain T, Smith P, Yee LM.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020 May 28;8(5):e15111. doi: 10.2196/15111.,Hussain T,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2020,2020/05/29,PMC7290451,,10.2196/15111,"BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases have recently had an increasing effect on maternal-fetal health, especially in high-income countries. However, there remains a lack of discussion regarding health management with technological approaches, including mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate mHealth interventions used in pregnancy in high-income countries and their effects on maternal health behaviors and maternal-fetal health outcomes. METHODS: This systematic review identified studies published between January 1, 2000, and November 30, 2018, in MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and gray literature. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included only pregnant women in high-income countries and evaluated stand-alone mobile phone interventions intended to promote healthy maternal beliefs, behaviors, and/or maternal-fetal health outcomes. Two researchers independently reviewed and categorized aspects of full-text articles, including source, study design, intervention and control, duration, participant age, attrition rate, main outcomes, and risk of bias. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and the study was registered in PROSPERO before initiation. RESULTS: Of the 2225 records examined, 28 studies were included and categorized into 4 themes: (1) gestational weight gain, obesity and physical activity (n=9); (2) smoking cessation (n=9); (3) influenza vaccination (n=2); and (4) general prenatal health, preventive strategies, and miscellaneous topics (n=8). Reported sample sizes ranged from 16 to 5243 with a median of 91. Most studies were performed in the United States (18/28, 64%) and were randomized controlled trials (21/28, 75%). All participants in the included studies were pregnant at the time of study initiation. Overall, 14% (4/28) of studies showed association between intervention use and improved health outcomes; all 4 studies focused on healthy gestational weight. Among those, 3 studies showed intervention use was associated with less overall gestational weight gain. These 3 studies involved interventions with text messaging or an app in combination with another communication strategy (Facebook or email). Regarding smoking cessation, influenza vaccination, and miscellaneous topics, there was some evidence of positive effects on health behaviors and beliefs, but very limited correlation with improved health outcomes. Data and interventions were heterogeneous, precluding a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In high-income countries, utilization of mobile phone-based health behavior interventions in pregnancy demonstrates some correlation with positive beliefs, behaviors, and health outcomes. More effective interventions are multimodal in terms of features and tend to focus on healthy gestational weight gain."
Mobile Health Intervention in the Maternal Care Pathway: Protocol for the Impact Evaluation of hAPPyMamma,"Bonciani M, De Rosis S, Vainieri M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Jan 19;10(1):e19073. doi: 10.2196/19073.,Bonciani M,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/01/19,PMC7854034,,10.2196/19073,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) has great potential to both improve the quality and efficiency of care and increase health literacy and empowerment of patient users. There are several studies related to the introduction of mHealth tools for supporting pregnancy and the postnatal period, with promising but not yet rigorously evaluated impacts. This article presents the protocol for evaluating an mHealth intervention (hAPPyMamma) applied in the maternal and child care pathway of a high-income country (in a pilot area of Tuscany Region, Italy). OBJECTIVE: The protocol describes hAPPyMamma and the methods for evaluating its impact, including the points of view of women and practitioners. The research hypothesis is that the use of hAPPyMamma will facilitate a more appropriate use of available services, a better care experience for women, and an improvement in the maternal competencies of the women using the app compared to the control group. The protocol also includes analysis of the organizational impact of the introduction of hAPPyMamma in the maternal pathway. METHODS: A pre-post quasiexperimental design with a control group is used to undertake difference-in-differences analysis for assessing the impact of the mHealth intervention from the mothers' points of view. The outcome measures are improvement of maternal health literacy and empowerment as well as experience in the maternal care pathway of the control and intervention groups of sampled mothers. The organizational impact is evaluated through a quantitative and qualitative survey addressing professionals and managers of the maternal care pathway involved in the intervention. RESULTS: Following study recruitment, 177 women were enrolled in the control group and 150 in the intervention group, with a participation rate of 97%-98%. The response rate was higher in the control group than in the intervention group (96% vs 67%), though the intervention group had less respondent loss at the postintervention survey (10% compared to 33% of the control group). Data collection from the women was completed in April 2018, while that from professionals and managers is underway. CONCLUSIONS: The study helps consolidate evidence of the utility of mHealth interventions for maternal and child care in developed countries. This paper presents a protocol for analyzing the potential role of hAPPyMamma as an effective mHealth tool for improving the maternal care pathway at individual and organizational levels and consequently helps to understand whether and how to scale up this intervention, with local, national, and international scopes of application.

A personalized intervention to prevent depression in primary care based on risk predictive algorithms and decision support systems: protocol of the e-predictD study,"Bellón JA, Rodríguez-Morejón A, Conejo-Cerón S, Campos-Paíno H, Rodríguez-Bayón A, Ballesta-Rodríguez MI, Rodríguez-Sánchez E, Mendive JM, López Del Hoyo Y, Luna JD, Tamayo-Morales O, Moreno-Peral P.",Front Psychiatry. 2023 Jun 2;14:1163800. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1163800. eCollection 2023.,Bellón JA,Front Psychiatry,2023,2023/06/19,PMC10275079,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1163800,"The predictD is an intervention implemented by general practitioners (GPs) to prevent depression, which reduced the incidence of depression-anxiety and was cost-effective. The e-predictD study aims to design, develop, and evaluate an evolved predictD intervention to prevent the onset of major depression in primary care based on Information and Communication Technologies, predictive risk algorithms, decision support systems (DSSs), and personalized prevention plans (PPPs). A multicenter cluster randomized trial with GPs randomly assigned to the e-predictD intervention + care-as-usual (CAU) group or the active-control + CAU group and 1-year follow-up is being conducted. The required sample size is 720 non-depressed patients (aged 18-55 years), with moderate-to-high depression risk, under the care of 72 GPs in six Spanish cities. The GPs assigned to the e-predictD-intervention group receive brief training, and those assigned to the control group do not. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the e-predictD group download the e-predictD app, which incorporates validated risk algorithms to predict depression, monitoring systems, and DSSs. Integrating all inputs, the DSS automatically proposes to the patients a PPP for depression based on eight intervention modules: physical exercise, social relationships, improving sleep, problem-solving, communication skills, decision-making, assertiveness, and working with thoughts. This PPP is discussed in a 15-min semi-structured GP-patient interview. Patients then choose one or more of the intervention modules proposed by the DSS to be self-implemented over the next 3 months. This process will be reformulated at 3, 6, and 9 months but without the GP-patient interview. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the control-group+CAU download another version of the e-predictD app, but the only intervention that they receive via the app is weekly brief psychoeducational messages (active-control group). The primary outcome is the cumulative incidence of major depression measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview at 6 and 12 months. Other outcomes include depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), depression risk (predictD risk algorithm), mental and physical quality of life (SF-12), and acceptability and satisfaction ('e-Health Impact' questionnaire) with the intervention. Patients are evaluated at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. An economic evaluation will also be performed (cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis) from two perspectives, societal and health systems.

Synthesizing reviews of e-&mHealth interventions to improve weight and weight-related behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, and diet) is useful to characterize the current scope of the literature and identify opportunities for future reviews and studies. Using a scoping review methodology, we aimed to evaluate the breadth and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of e-&mHealth interventions targeting weight and weight-related behaviors in children and adolescents aged <19 years. A systematic search of seven databases was conducted, including reviews published between 2000 and 2019. Review characteristics were extracted, and methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool. Forty-five systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. All reviews evaluated intervention efficacy (100%), but few assessed other aspects (20% in total) such as cost-effectiveness. Smartphone applications (47%), text messages (44%), and websites (35%) were the main modalities. Weight (60%), physical activity (51%), and diet (44%) were frequently assessed, unlike sedentary behavior (8%). Most reviews were rated as having critically low or low methodological quality (97%). Reviews that identify the effective active ingredients of interventions and explore metrics beyond efficacy are recommended."
Leveraging Community Health Workers and a Responsive Digital Health System to Improve Vaccination Coverage and Timeliness in Resource-Limited Settings: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Type 1 Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Study,"Vasudevan L, Ostermann J, Thielman N, Baumgartner JN, Solomon D, Mosses A, Hobbie A, Hair NL, Liang C, van Zwetselaar M, Mfinanga S, Ngadaya E.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2024 Jan 12;13:e52523. doi: 10.2196/52523.,Vasudevan L,JMIR Res Protoc,2024,2024/01/12,PMC10818232,,10.2196/52523,"BACKGROUND: Tanzania is 1 of 20 countries where the majority of unvaccinated and undervaccinated children reside. Prior research identified substantial rural-urban disparities in the coverage and timeliness of childhood vaccinations in Tanzania, with children in rural settings being more likely to receive delayed or no vaccinations. Further research is necessary to identify effective and scalable interventions that can bridge rural-urban gaps in childhood vaccination while accounting for multifaceted barriers to vaccination. OBJECTIVE: This protocol describes a type 1 effectiveness-implementation hybrid study to evaluate Chanjo Kwa Wakati (timely vaccination in Kiswahili), a community-based digital health intervention to improve vaccination timeliness. The intervention combines human resources (community health workers), low-cost digital strategies (electronic communication, digital case management, and task automation), a vaccination knowledge intervention, and insights from behavioral economics (reminders and incentives) to promote timely childhood vaccinations. METHODS: The study will be conducted in 2 predominantly rural regions in Tanzania with large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated children: Shinyanga and Mwanza. Forty rural health facilities and their catchment areas (clusters) will be randomized to an early or delayed onset study arm. From each cluster, 3 cohorts of mother-child dyads (1 retrospective cohort and 2 prospective cohorts) will be enrolled in the study. The timeliness and coverage of all vaccinations recommended during the first year of life will be observed for 1200 children (n=600, 50% intervention group children and n=600, 50% nonintervention group children). The primary effectiveness outcome will be the timeliness of the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine (Penta3). Quantitative surveys, vaccination records, study logs, fidelity checklists, and qualitative interviews with mothers and key informants will inform the 5 constructs of the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The results will be used to develop an implementation blueprint to guide future adaptations and scale-up of Chanjo Kwa Wakati. RESULTS: The study was funded in August 2022. Data collection is expected to last from February 2024 to July 2027. CONCLUSIONS: This study will address the lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of community-based digital health interventions for promoting vaccination coverage and timeliness among children from sub-Saharan Africa and identify potential implementation strategies to facilitate the deployment of vaccination promotion interventions in low- and middle-income countries.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to conduct a systematic review to synthesize the existing literature on the patterns of use and effects of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for improving treatment adherence and outcomes of care for CMD among people living with HIV. METHODS: A systematic search of multiple databases, including PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, African Journals online, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization Global Index Medicus of peer-reviewed articles, was conducted with no date or language restrictions. Unpublished reports on mHealth interventions for treatment adherence and outcomes of care for CMD among adults living with HIV were also included in this review. Studies were included if they had at least 1 component that used an mHealth intervention to address treatment adherence or 1 or more of the stated outcomes of care for CMD among people living with HIV. RESULTS: Our search strategy yielded 1148 unique records. In total, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Of the 10 studies, only 4 had published results. The categories of mHealth interventions ranged from short messaging, telephone calls, and wearable devices to smartphone and desktop web-based mobile apps. Across the different categories of interventions, there were no clear patterns in terms of consistency in the use of a particular intervention, as most studies (9/10, 90%) assessed a combination of mHealth interventions. Short messaging and telephone calls were however the most common interventions. Half of the studies (5/10, 50%) reported on outcomes that were indirectly linked to CMD, and none of them provided reliable evidence for evaluating the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for treatment adherence and outcomes of care for CMD among people living with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the limited number of studies and the heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures in the studies, no definitive conclusions could be drawn on the patterns of use and effects of mHealth interventions for treatment adherence and outcomes of care for CMD among people living with HIV. We therefore recommend that future trials should focus on standardized outcomes for CMD. We also suggest that future studies should consider having a longer follow-up period in order to determine the long-term effects of mHealth interventions on CMD outcomes for people living with HIV.

Innovative approaches that are safe, cost-effective, and scalable are needed to address the burden of traumatic stress caused by emergencies. High mobile phone ownership rates combined with the precision of neural, cognitive, and biometric measures of trauma and their feasible integration with artificial intelligence makes digital app interventions a promising pathway to promote precision diagnosis and high-impact care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to advance methods for the objective diagnosis and treatment of trauma in emergencies across LMICs by examining neural, cognitive, and biometric markers and the efficacy of the eResilience app, a neuroscience-informed mobile health mental health app intervention, via changes in clinical symptomatology, cognitive performance, and brain activity. METHODS: Trauma-exposed African refugees residing in Australia were selected for this study. A research software version of the eResilience app with advanced monitoring capabilities was designed for this trial. Participants completed the eResilience app at home during a 7-day period. Clinical, cognitive, and electrophysiological data were collected at baseline, along with posttest measurements to examine biomarkers of trauma and the efficacy of the proposed digital intervention for the treatment of trauma and its potential outcomes, including depression, anxiety, physical symptoms, self-harm, substance misuse, and cognitive impairment. In addition, biofeedback, well-being, and subjective stress data points were collected via the app during the treatment week, followed by clinical interviews at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the intervention. RESULTS: Data collection was conducted between 2018 and 2020. A total of 100 participants exposed to war were screened; 75 (75%) were enrolled and assigned to a trauma-exposed control (38/75, 51%) or posttraumatic stress disorder condition (37/75, 49%); and 70 (70%) completed all baseline, treatment, and posttest assessments. A total of 89% (62/70) of those who completed the intervention opted to enroll in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Data collection is complete. As of May 2022, the results of all proposed analyses are being prepared for publication. If proven efficacious, this proof-of-concept clinical trial will inform fully powered randomized clinical trials in LMICs to further develop artificial intelligence-powered, app-based diagnostic and prognostic features and determine the app's cross-cultural efficacy for the treatment of trauma in emergency settings. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol provides researchers with a comprehensive background of the study rationale, a detailed guideline for replication studies interested in examining the feasibility and efficacy of the eResilience app across varied demographics, and a robust framework for investigating low-cost objective diagnostic markers in mental health interventions.

App-Based Salt Reduction Intervention in School Children and Their Families (AppSalt) in China: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Process Evaluation,"Sun Y, Luo R, Li Y, He FJ, Tan M, MacGregor GA, Liu H, Zhang P.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Feb 10;10(2):e19430. doi: 10.2196/19430.,Sun Y,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/02/10,PMC7904395,,10.2196/19430,"BACKGROUND: The app-based salt reduction intervention program in school children and their families (AppSalt) is a multicomponent mobile health (mHealth) intervention program, which involves multiple stakeholders, including students, parents, teachers, school heads, and local health and education authorities. The complexity of the AppSalt program highlights the need for process evaluation to investigate how the implementation will be achieved at different sites. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a process evaluation protocol of the AppSalt program, which aims to monitor the implementation of the program, explain its causal mechanisms, and provide evidence for scaling up the program nationwide. METHODS: A mixed methods approach will be used to collect data relating to five process evaluation dimensions: fidelity, dose delivered, dose received, reach, and context. Quantitative data, including app use logs, activity logs, and routine monitoring data, will be collected alongside the intervention process to evaluate the quantity and quality of intervention activities. The quantitative data will be summarized as medians, means, and proportions as appropriate. Qualitative data will be collected through semistructured interviews of purposely selected intervention participants and key stakeholders from local health and education authorities. The thematic analysis technique will be used for analyzing the qualitative data with the support of NVivo 12. The qualitative data will be triangulated with the quantitative data during the interpretation phase to explain the 5 process evaluation dimensions. RESULTS: The intervention activities of the AppSalt program were initiated at 27 primary schools in three cities since October 2018. We have completed the 1-year intervention of this program. The quantitative data for this study, including app use log, activity logs, and the routine monitoring data, were collected and organized during the intervention process. After completing the intervention, we conducted semistructured interviews with 32 students, 32 parents, 9 teachers, 9 school heads, and 8 stakeholders from local health and education departments. Data analysis is currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: Using mHealth technology for salt reduction among primary school students is an innovation in China. The findings of this study will help researchers understand the implementation of the AppSalt program and similar mHealth interventions in real-world settings. Furthermore, this process evaluation will be informative for other researchers and policy makers interested in replicating the AppSalt program and designing their salt reduction intervention.

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of outcomes of TBIs v. face-to-face interventions in psychosis were identified in a systematic search conducted in PubMed/Ovid MEDLINE. Data were extracted independently by two researchers, and standardized mean changes were pooled using a three-level model and network meta-analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were included. TBIs complementing treatment as usual (TAU) were generally superior to face-to-face interventions (g = 0.16, p </= 0.0001) and to specific outcomes, namely, neurocognition (g = 0.13, p </= 0.0001), functioning (g = 0.25, p = 0.006), and social cognition (g = 0.32, p </= 0.05). Based on the network meta-analysis, the effect of two TBIs differed significantly from zero; these were the TBIs cognitive training for the neurocognitive outcome [g = 0.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.23] and cognitive behavioral therapy for quality of life (g = 1.27; 95% CI 0.46-2.08). The variables educational level, type of medication, frequency of the intervention, and contact during the intervention moderated the effectiveness of TBIs over face-to-face interventions in neurocognition and symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: TBIs are effective for the management of neurocognition, symptomatology, functioning, social cognition, and quality of life outcomes in patients with psychosis. The results of the network meta-analysis showed the efficacy of some TBIs for neurocognition, symptomatology, and quality of life. Therefore, TBIs should be considered a complement to TAU in patients with psychosis."
Development of a ParticipACTION App-Based Intervention for Improving Postsecondary Students' 24-Hour Movement Guideline Behaviors: Protocol for the Application of Intervention Mapping,"Flood SM, Thompson B, Faulkner G, Vanderloo LM, Blackett B, Dolf M, Latimer-Cheung AE, Duggan M, Di Sebastiano KM, Lane KN, Brouwers MC, McKenna J, Chulak-Bozzer T, Fuller D, Ruissen GR, Sturrock SL, Tomasone JR.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2023 Mar 14;12:e39977. doi: 10.2196/39977.,Flood SM,JMIR Res Protoc,2023,2023/03/14,PMC10131646,,10.2196/39977,"BACKGROUND: The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for adults provide specific recommendations for levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep (ie, the movement behaviors) required for optimal health. Performance of the movement behaviors is associated with improved mental well-being. However, most postsecondary students do not meet the movement behavior recommendations within the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines and experience increased stress and declining well-being, suggesting the need for an intervention targeting students' movement behaviors. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop and implement a theory-informed intervention intended to improve the movement behaviors and mental well-being of first-year postsecondary students. METHODS: The Intervention Mapping protocol was applied in the development and implementation of the intervention. Intervention Mapping entailed performing a needs assessment, determining the intervention outcomes, selecting theory- and evidence-based change methods and applications, preparing and producing intervention plans and materials, developing the implementation plan, and finally developing an evaluation plan. The Theoretical Domains Framework and the Behavior Change Wheel were also used in conjunction with the Intervention Mapping protocol to ensure a solid theoretical basis for the intervention. This protocol led to the development and implementation of a 6-week, theory-informed ParticipACTION app-based intervention aimed at helping first-year postsecondary students improve their movement behaviors and mental well-being. The developed app content provided students with information on each of the movement behaviors and behavioral strategies (ie, goal setting, action planning, monitoring, and coping planning). The use of Intervention Mapping allowed for the continuous involvement of various multidisciplinary partners and end users, ensuring that the intervention design and implementation was appropriate for the target audience. The feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of the intervention will be examined in a subsequent proof-of-concept study at 2 Canadian university campuses. RESULTS: Participant recruitment occurred during September 2021, and the intervention was conducted from October to December 2021. The deadline for completion of the postintervention questionnaire by participants was mid-December 2021. The analysis of data examining the feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of the intervention began in January 2022, with the publication of the proof-of-concept evaluation expected in 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention Mapping with the Theoretical Domains Framework and Behavior Change Wheel was a useful approach to combine evidence and theoretical concepts to guide the design and implementation of a ParticipACTION app-based intervention targeting postsecondary students' movement behaviors and mental well-being. This process may serve as an example for other researchers developing multiple behavior change app-based interventions. Should the forthcoming evaluation demonstrate the intervention's acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact, the intervention may provide a scalable method of improving postsecondary students' movement behaviors and mental well-being.

Assessing the internal and external validity of mobile health physical activity promotion interventions: a systematic literature review using the RE-AIM framework,"Blackman KC, Zoellner J, Berrey LM, Alexander R, Fanning J, Hill JL, Estabrooks PA.",J Med Internet Res. 2013 Oct 4;15(10):e224. doi: 10.2196/jmir.2745.,Blackman KC,J Med Internet Res,2013,2013/10/08,PMC3806547,,10.2196/jmir.2745,"BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are effective in promoting physical activity (PA); however, the degree to which external validity indicators are reported is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to use the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework to determine the extent to which mHealth intervention research for promoting PA reports on factors that inform generalizability across settings and populations and to provide recommendations for investigators planning to conduct this type of research. METHODS: Twenty articles reflecting 15 trials published between 2000 and 2012 were identified through a systematic review process (ie, queries of three online databases and reference lists of eligible articles) and met inclusion criteria (ie, implementation of mobile technologies, target physical activity, and provide original data). Two researchers coded each article using a validated RE-AIM data extraction tool (reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance). Two members of the study team independently abstracted information from each article (inter-rater reliability >90%) and group meetings were used to gain consensus on discrepancies. RESULTS: The majority of studies were randomized controlled trials (n=14). The average reporting across RE-AIM indicators varied by dimension (reach=53.3%, 2.67/5; effectiveness/efficacy=60.0%, 2.4/4; adoption=11.1%, 0.7/6; implementation=24.4%, 0.7/3; maintenance=0%, 0/3). While most studies described changes in the primary outcome (effectiveness), few addressed the representativeness of participants (reach) or settings (adoption) and few reported on issues related to maintenance and degree of implementation fidelity. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that more focus is needed on research designs that highlight and report on both internal and external validity indicators. Specific recommendations are provided to encourage future mHealth interventionists and investigators to report on representativeness, settings, delivery agents for planned interventions, the extent to which protocol is delivered as intended, and maintenance of effects at the individual or organizational level."
Adaptive Elements in Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment Systems: Systematic Review,"Mukhiya SK, Wake JD, Inal Y, Pun KI, Lamo Y.",J Med Internet Res. 2020 Nov 27;22(11):e21066. doi: 10.2196/21066.,Mukhiya SK,J Med Internet Res,2020,2020/11/27,PMC7732710,,10.2196/21066,"BACKGROUND: Internet-delivered psychological treatments (IDPTs) are built on evidence-based psychological treatment models, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, and are adjusted for internet use. The use of internet technologies has the potential to increase access to evidence-based mental health services for a larger proportion of the population with the use of fewer resources. However, despite extensive evidence that internet interventions can be effective in the treatment of mental health disorders, user adherence to such internet intervention is suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to (1) inspect and identify the adaptive elements of IDPT for mental health disorders, (2) examine how system adaptation influences the efficacy of IDPT on mental health treatments, (3) identify the information architecture, adaptive dimensions, and strategies for implementing these interventions for mental illness, and (4) use the findings to create a conceptual framework that provides better user adherence and adaptiveness in IDPT for mental health issues. METHODS: The review followed the guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The research databases Medline (PubMed), ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane were searched for studies dating from January 2000 to January 2020. Based on predetermined selection criteria, data from eligible studies were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 3341 studies were initially identified based on the inclusion criteria. Following a review of the title, abstract, and full text, 31 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected, most of which described attempts to tailor interventions for mental health disorders. The most common adaptive elements were feedback messages to patients from therapists and intervention content. However, how these elements contribute to the efficacy of IDPT in mental health were not reported. The most common information architecture used by studies was tunnel-based, although a number of studies did not report the choice of information architecture used. Rule-based strategies were the most common adaptive strategies used by these studies. All of the studies were broadly grouped into two adaptive dimensions based on user preferences or using performance measures, such as psychometric tests. CONCLUSIONS: Several studies suggest that adaptive IDPT has the potential to enhance intervention outcomes and increase user adherence. There is a lack of studies reporting design elements, adaptive elements, and adaptive strategies in IDPT systems. Hence, focused research on adaptive IDPT systems and clinical trials to assess their effectiveness are needed."
The Importance of Activating Factors in Physical Activity Interventions for Older Adults Using Information and Communication Technologies: Systematic Review,"Bentlage E, Nyamadi JJ, Dubbeldam R.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Oct 24;11:e42968. doi: 10.2196/42968.,Bentlage E,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/11/07,PMC10644949,,10.2196/42968,"BACKGROUND: In an aging population, it is important to activate older adults in taking care of their own health. Increasing physical activity is one way to avoid or lessen age-related physical and mental impairments. Interest in the use of information and communication technology (ICT) tools to promote physical activity among older adults is growing considerably. Such tools are suitable for communicating activation factors-skills, knowledge, and motivation-by integrating a variety of behavior change techniques (BCTs) to enhance physical activity. Although activation factors have been incorporated into physical activity interventions using ICT, little is known about the actual integration methods used in such interventions or about the effects of activation factors on influencing behavior change. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to identify which of the activation factors were covered in physical activity-promoting ICT interventions for older adults and which BCTs were used to address them. The second objective was to classify the user interaction interfaces and delivery modes that were used to promote these activation factors. METHODS: The search engines of PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect were used to search for and identify articles examining the effectiveness of ICT interventions for promoting physical activity in older adults. References and related data were selected, extracted, and reviewed independently by 2 reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed, and any conflict was addressed by a third separate reviewer. Selected articles included older adults aged >/=55 years without pre-existing medical diseases and other physical or mental conditions that could hinder movement. RESULTS: In total, 368 records were retrieved, and 13 studies met all inclusion criteria. Articles differed in terms of themes, timescales, user interaction interfaces, and outcome measures; therefore, a quantitative data synthesis was not feasible. Motivation was the most promoted activation factor among all trials (33 times). An app and a smartwatch were used in the majority of intervention groups (7/20, 35%) for tracking physical activity and receiving personalized feedback based on the individual goals. Skills (25 times) and knowledge (17 times) were the next most commonly addressed activation factors. Face-to-face interaction was the most used approach to targeting users' skills, including providing instructions on how to perform a behavior and exchanging knowledge via education on the health consequences of insufficient physical activity. Overall, integrating all 3 activation factors and using multiple user interaction interfaces with a variety of delivery modes proved the most effective in improving physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights commonly used BCTs and preferred modes of their delivery. So far, only a limited number of available BCTs (21/99, 21%) have been integrated. Considering their effectiveness, a larger variety of BCTs that address skills, knowledge, and motivation should be exploited in future ICT interventions."
Impact of mobile health interventions during the perinatal period on maternal psychosocial outcomes: a systematic review,"Dol J, Richardson B, Murphy GT, Aston M, McMillan D, Campbell-Yeo M.",JBI Evid Synth. 2020 Jan;18(1):30-55. doi: 10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00191.,Dol J,JBI Evid Synth,2020,2020/01/24,,,10.11124/JBISRIR-D-19-00191,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of mother-targeted mobile health (mHealth) education interventions during the perinatal period on maternal psychosocial outcomes in high-income countries. INTRODUCTION: The perinatal period is an exciting yet challenging period for mothers that requires physical, emotional and social adjustment to new norms and expectations. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of mHealth by new mothers who are seeking health information through online or mobile applications. While there have been systematic reviews on the impact of mHealth interventions on maternal and newborn health in low- and middle-income countries, the impact of these interventions on maternal psychosocial health outcomes in high-income countries remains uncertain. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered studies of mHealth education interventions targeting mothers in high-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) during the perinatal period. Interventions must have started between the antenatal period (conception through birth) through six weeks postpartum. All experimental study designs were included. Outcomes included self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Embase were searched for published studies in English on December 16, 2018. Gray literature was also searched for non-peer reviewed articles, including Google Scholar, mHealth intelligence and clinical trials databases. Critical appraisal was undertaken by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal instruments from JBI. Quantitative data were extracted from included studies independently by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI. All conflicts were solved through consensus with a third reviewer. Quantitative data were, where possible, pooled in statistical meta-analysis using RevMan. Where statistical pooling was not possible, findings were reported narratively. RESULTS: Of the 1,607 unique articles identified, 106 full-text papers were screened and 24 articles were critically appraised, with 21 included in the final review. Eleven were quasi-experimental and 10 were randomized controlled trials. The mHealth intervention approach varied, with text message and mobile applications being the most common. Length of intervention ranged from four weeks to six months. The topics of the mHealth intervention varied widely, with the most common topic being postpartum depression. Mothers who received an mHealth intervention targeting postpartum depression showed a decreased score on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale when measured post-intervention (odds ratio = -6.01, 95% confidence interval = -8.34 to -3.67, p < 0.00001). The outcomes related to self-efficacy, social support and anxiety showed mixed findings of effectiveness (beneficial and no change) across the studies identified. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides insight into the effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting mothers in high-income countries in the perinatal period to enhance four psychosocial outcomes: self-efficacy, social support, anxiety and depression. Despite a wide variety of outcome measurements used, the predominant findings suggest that there are insufficient data to conclude that mHealth interventions can improve self-efficacy and anxiety outcomes. Potential benefits on social support were related to interventions targeting postnatal behaviors. Postpartum depression was the mostly commonly reported outcome. Findings related to the comparison of pre-post outcomes and intervention versus control demonstrated that mHealth interventions targeting postpartum depression were associated with a reduction in postpartum depression."

The importance of stress management is now recognized in recent guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease. However, effective stress management interventions are not implemented in clinical routine yet. The development of easily disseminated eHealth interventions, particularly mHealth, may offer a cost-effective and scalable solution to this problem. The aim of the proposed trial is to assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the mHealth intervention ""mindfulHeart"" in terms of reducing stress in patients with IHD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomized controlled confirmatory interventional trial with two parallel arms has assessments at six measurement time points: baseline (T0, prior randomization), post-treatment (T1), and four follow-ups at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 after intervention (T2, T3, T4, and T5). We will include patients with confirmed diagnosis of IHD, high-perceived stress, and use of an internet-enabled smartphone. Patients will be randomized into two groups (intervention vs. control). The proposed sample size calculation allocates 128 participants in total. The primary analysis will be performed in the intention-to-treat population, with missing data imputed. An ANCOVA with the outcome at T1, a between-subject factor (intervention vs. control), and the participants' pre-intervention baseline values as a covariate will be used. Different ANOVAs, regression, and descriptive approaches will be performed for secondary analyses.

Caring for the elderly is difficult and stressful and threatens physical and mental health of informal caregivers. We aim to design a web-based support group and assess its effectiveness on depression, anxiety, and stress among elderly informal caregivers. METHODS: This is a protocol for a two-arm randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 informal elderly caregivers will be recruited from the southern area of Tehran. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to two intervention and control groups. The inclusion criteria include not receiving salary for caring, having primary responsibility for care, having smartphone/tablet/computer, being able to use the contents and web applications, having at least one month of experience in caring for the elderly, and having access to the Internet at least once weekly. The intervention will be implemented by giving an account access to the designed website. Depression, anxiety, and stress will be assessed using the DASS21 questionnaire at baseline, and at the end of third and sixth months. DISCUSSION: Our findings can pave the way for improving the mental health of informal caregivers of the elderly through provision of web-based supportive services. This study stands as an opportunity to address the needs of caregivers and help them support each other in a novel way.

Integration of Mobile Health Into Sickle Cell Disease Care to Increase Hydroxyurea Utilization: Protocol for an Efficacy and Implementation Study,"Hankins JS, Shah N, DiMartino L, Brambilla D, Fernandez ME, Gibson RW, Gordeuk VR, Lottenberg R, Kutlar A, Melvin C, Simon J, Wun T, Treadwell M, Calhoun C, Baumann A, Potter MB, Klesges L, Bosworth H; Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Jul 14;9(7):e16319. doi: 10.2196/16319.,Hankins JS,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/05/23,PMC7388044,,10.2196/16319,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea prevents disease complications among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although its efficacy has been endorsed by the National Health Lung and Blood Institute evidence-based guidelines, its adoption is low, both by patients with SCD and providers. Mobile health (mHealth) apps provide benefits in improving medication adherence and self-efficacy among patients with chronic diseases and have facilitated prescription among medical providers. However, mHealth has not been systematically tested as a tool to increase hydroxyurea adherence nor has the combination of mHealth been assessed at both patient and provider levels to increase hydroxyurea utilization. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to increase hydroxyurea utilization through a combined two-level mHealth intervention for both patients with SCD and their providers with the goals of increasing adherence to hydroxyurea among patients and improve hydroxyurea prescribing behavior among providers. METHODS: We will test the efficacy of 2 mHealth interventions to increase both patient and provider utilization and knowledge of hydroxyurea in 8 clinical sites of the NHLBI-funded Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC). The patient mHealth intervention, InCharge Health, includes multiple components that address memory, motivation, and knowledge barriers to hydroxyurea use. The provider mHealth intervention, Hydroxyurea Toolbox (HU Toolbox), addresses the clinical knowledge barriers in prescribing and monitoring hydroxyurea. The primary hypothesis is that among adolescents and adults with SCD, adherence to hydroxyurea, as measured by the proportion of days covered (the ratio of the number of days the patient is covered by the medication to the number of days in the treatment period), will increase by at least 20% after 24 weeks of receiving the InCharge Health app, compared with their adherence at baseline. As secondary objectives, we will (1) examine the change in health-related quality of life, acute disease complications, perceived health literacy, and perceived self-efficacy in taking hydroxyurea among patients who use InCharge Health and (2) examine potential increases in the awareness of hydroxyurea benefits and risks, appropriate prescribing, and perceived self-efficacy to correctly administer hydroxyurea therapy among SCD providers between baseline and 9 months of using the HU Toolbox app. We will measure the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of both the InCharge Health and the HU Toolbox apps using the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework and qualitatively evaluate the implementation of both mHealth interventions. RESULTS: The study is currently enrolling study participants. Recruitment is anticipated to be completed by mid-2021. CONCLUSIONS: If this two-level intervention, that is, the combined use of InCharge Health and HU Toolbox apps, demonstrates efficacy in increasing adherence to hydroxyurea and prescribing behavior in patients with SCD and their providers, respectively, both apps will be offered to other institutions outside the SCDIC through a future large-scale implementation-effectiveness study.

This study aims to develop and pilot test a theory-informed, tailored mobile phone intervention that was codeveloped by young gay men, HIV clinicians and public health researchers to increase engagement in PrEP education and initiation among Chinese gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), who bear a disproportionate burden of HIV infections and remain underserved in the healthcare system. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This two-phase study includes a formative assessment using in-depth interviews (N=30) and a 12-week experimental pilot study using a two-arm randomised controlled trial design (N=70). The primary intervention is delivered through a WeChat-based mini-app (a program built into a Chinese multipurpose social media application) developed by young GBMSM from a 2019 crowdsourcing hackathon. Using mixed methods, we will further investigate the specific needs and concerns among GBMSM in terms of using PrEP as an HIV prevention strategy, how their concerns and PrEP use behaviours may change with exposure to the mini-app intervention during the study period and how we can further refine this intervention tool to better meet GBMSM's needs for broader implementation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study and its protocols have been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA (19-3481), the Guangdong Provincial Dermatology Hospital, China (2020031) and the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, China (202022155).

UVR-sensor wearable device intervention to improve sun behaviors and reduce sunburns in melanoma survivors: study protocol of a parallel-group randomized controlled trial,"Vogel RI, Nagler RH, Ahmed RL, Brown K, Luo X, Martinson BC, Lazovich D.",Trials. 2020 Nov 23;21(1):959. doi: 10.1186/s13063-020-04881-3.,Vogel RI,Trials,2020,2020/11/24,PMC7682122,,10.1186/s13063-020-04881-3,"BACKGROUND: Individuals who have been diagnosed with melanoma have more than a 9-fold increased risk of developing another melanoma. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure following a melanoma diagnosis can be modified to reduce risk of a new melanoma diagnosis. Yet research shows that many melanoma survivors do not report optimal sun protection practices. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a UVR-sensor wearable device to improve sun protection behaviors and reduce sunburns in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in melanoma survivors. METHODS: We will conduct an RCT among 368 melanoma survivors in two waves (Summer 2020, Summer 2021). This approach allows for adequate recruitment of the required sample and potential improvements to recruitment, compliance, and retention strategies between waves. The intervention includes an informational brochure about sun protection behaviors and a commercially available UVR-sensor wearable device (Shade), which accurately measures UVR. The device, along with its associated mobile application, measures and stores UVR exposure. As UVR exposure accumulates, the device provides notifications to increase sun protection action. Survivors in the control group receive the device and a separate mobile application that does not provide notifications or summary UVR exposure data. Participants will be asked to wear the device for 12 weeks. They will complete surveys about their sun behaviors at study entry, every 4 weeks during the intervention, and 1 year later. At the end of the intervention period, intervention and control groups will be compared for differences in a summary measure of sun protection habits and experience of a sunburn. We will also measure self-reported physical activity, depression, and anxiety to examine potential unintended negative consequences of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study intervention will be completed Fall 2021, with anticipated results available in 2022. If this intervention improves sun protection behaviors in melanoma survivors, these findings would support expanding the use of this technology with other populations at high risk for melanoma.

"Developing a Video-Based eHealth Intervention for HIV-Positive Gay, Bisexual, and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Hirshfield S, Downing MJ Jr, Parsons JT, Grov C, Gordon RJ, Houang ST, Scheinmann R, Sullivan PS, Yoon IS, Anderson I, Chiasson MA.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2016 Jun 17;5(2):e125. doi: 10.2196/resprot.5554.,Hirshfield S,JMIR Res Protoc,2016,2016/06/19,PMC4930529,,10.2196/resprot.5554,"BACKGROUND: Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) accounted for 67% of new US human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in 2012; however, less than 40% of HIV-positive GBMSM are virally suppressed. Preventing transmission from virally unsuppressed men who have condomless anal sex (CAS) with serodiscordant partners is a public health imperative. New HIV infections in GBMSM are attributed in part to online access to sex partners; therefore, low-cost eHealth interventions are a unique opportunity to reach men where they meet partners. OBJECTIVE: To describe the protocol of a randomized controlled trial evaluating whether video-based messaging delivered online may lead to reductions in serodiscordant CAS and increased HIV disclosure. METHODS: Sex Positive!([+]) is a two-arm, phase III, video-based randomized controlled trial delivered online to GBMSM living with HIV. Participants in the intervention arm receive 10 video vignettes grounded in social learning and social cognitive theories that are designed to elicit critical thinking around issues of HIV transmission and disclosure. Participants in the attention control arm receive 10 video vignettes that focus on healthy living. All videos are optimized for mobile viewing. The study protocol includes five online assessments conducted over a 1-year period among 1500 US white, black, or Hispanic/Latino GBMSM living with HIV who report suboptimal antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence or a detectable viral load in the past 12 months and recent CAS (past 6 months) with HIV-negative or unknown status male partners. Compared to the control arm, we hypothesize that men who watch the intervention videos will report at 12-month follow-up significantly fewer serodiscordant CAS partners, increased HIV disclosure, and improved social cognition (eg, condom use self-efficacy, perceived responsibility). RESULTS: Participant recruitment began in June 2015 and ended in December 2015. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol describes the underlying theoretical framework and measures, study design, recruitment challenges, and antifraud measures for an online, video-based randomized controlled trial that has the potential to decrease HIV transmission risk behaviors among HIV-positive GBMSM who struggle with ART adherence. The Sex Positive!([+]) intervention allows for participation through multiple Internet-based mediums and has the potential to reach and engage a broader population of HIV-positive GBMSM who are virally unsuppressed.

METHOD: Systematic review with meta-analysis was undertaken with a search performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Library, DoPHER, TROPHI, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index. The population was adults (>18 years) with hypertension, intervention was an IDI and the comparator was usual care. Primary outcomes were change in SBP and DBP. Only randomized controlled trials and studies published in journals and in English were eligible. Eligible IDIs included interventions accessed through a computer, smartphone or other hand-held device. RESULTS: Four out of seven studies showed a significantly greater reduction for intervention compared to usual care for SBP, with no difference found for three. Overall, IDIs significantly reduced SBP, with the weighted mean difference being -3.74 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.19 to -2.58] with no heterogeneity observed (I-squared = 0.0%, P = 0.990). For DBP, four out of six studies indicated a greater reduction for intervention compared to controls, with no difference found for two. For DBP, a significant reduction of -2.37 mmHg (95% CI -0.40 to -4.35) was found, but considerable heterogeneity was noted (I-squared = 80.1%, P = <0.001). CONCLUSION: IDIs lower both SBP and DBP compared to usual care. Results suggest these findings can be applied to a wide range of healthcare systems and populations. However, sustainability and long-term clinical effectiveness of these interventions remain uncertain."
Adaptation of a Live Video Mind-Body Program to a Web-Based Platform for English-Speaking Adults With Neurofibromatosis: Protocol for the NF-Web Study,"Lester EG, Hopkins SW, Popok PJ, Vranceanu AM.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Jun 10;10(6):e27526. doi: 10.2196/27526.,Lester EG,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/06/10,PMC8262670,,10.2196/27526,"BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a rare genetic condition associated with lower but modifiable quality of life (QoL). Although a virtual live video program (Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for Neurofibromatosis [3RP-NF]; efficacy randomized controlled trial underway) that we created has been made available, ongoing barriers impede some patients from engaging in this intervention. A necessary next step is to develop a stand-alone web-based intervention that reduces barriers to accessing NF-specific psychosocial care. OBJECTIVE: First, we aim to develop a web-based platform (Neurofibromatosis-Web [NF-Web]) of our mind-body resiliency program (3RP-NF) through qualitative interviews with participants from an adult efficacy randomized controlled trial. Second, we aim to iteratively optimize the feasibility, acceptability, credibility, and satisfaction of the NF-Web platform through open pilot trials with participant exit interviews and explore quantitative outcomes within this sample. Here, we describe the protocol and study design, intervention, and analysis plan. METHODS: For aim 1, we will invite completers from our efficacy trial to participate in qualitative interviews. We will use data from these interviews to adapt the content of the live video program for asynchronous delivery and understand how to create a user-friendly format for an engaging web platform. For aim 2, we will enroll eligible participants recruited for the efficacy trial who could not enroll because of treatment barriers. Eligible participants will complete QoL, depression, anxiety, pain, treatment satisfaction, and program credibility measures at baseline and posttest. Inclusion criteria are identical to those for the efficacy trial, including stress and coping difficulties (self-report), no change in antidepressant medication in the past 3 months, no psychotherapy in the past 3 months, no major upcoming surgeries in the next 12 months, English speaking, ability to complete questionnaires on the web and participate in live video interventions, and consent before participation. The primary outcomes are feasibility, treatment satisfaction, and credibility. The secondary outcomes include physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL; depression; anxiety; pain intensity; and pain interference. We will enroll at least two group cohorts and iteratively refine the program based on participant feedback after each cohort completes the open pilot trial. RESULTS: This trial is ongoing. We have completed the interviews (n=23) and analyzed the data to construct the website. Afterward, we will recruit our cohorts for the trial (approximately n=15/cohort; total=30). Recruitment will end by May 2021, with plans to analyze the data by October 2021. CONCLUSIONS: We will develop the first web platform for people with NF with difficulties managing stress and NF symptoms and report on feasibility and preliminary effects in improving QoL and psychosocial functioning. NF-Web has potential to extend the reach of our 3RP-NF intervention by removing barriers to care, including lack of trained providers, scheduling difficulties, and appearance concerns.

Twitter is a Web-based platform that allows people to communicate with each other throughout the day using their phone. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to leverage the social media platform of Twitter for fostering peer-to-peer support to decrease relapse with quitting smoking. Furthermore, the study will compare the effects of coed versus women-only groups on women's success with quitting smoking. METHODS: The study design is a Web-based, three-arm randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms (a coed or women-only Twitter support group) and a control arm. Participants are recruited online and are randomized to one of the conditions. All participants will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (patches plus their choice of gum or lozenges), serial emails with links to Smokefree.gov quit guides, and instructions to record their quit date online (and to quit smoking on that date) on a date falling within a week of initiation of the study. Participants randomized to a treatment arm are placed in a fully automated Twitter support group (coed or women-only), paired with a buddy (matched on age, gender, location, and education), and encouraged to communicate with the group and buddy via daily tweeted discussion topics and daily automated feedback texts (a positive tweet if they tweet and an encouraging tweet if they miss tweeting). Recruited online from across the continental United States, the sample consists of 215 male and 745 female current cigarette smokers wanting to quit, aged between 21 and 59 years. Self-assessed follow-up surveys are completed online at 1, 3, and 6 months after the date they selected to quit smoking, with salivary cotinine validation at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome is sustained biochemically confirmed abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: From November 2016 to September 2018, 960 participants in 36 groups were recruited for the randomized controlled trial, in addition to 20 participants in an initial pilot group. Data analysis will commence soon for the randomized controlled trial based on data from 896 of the 960 participants (93.3%), with 56 participants lost to follow-up and 8 dropouts. CONCLUSIONS: This study combines the mobile platform of Twitter with a support group for quitting smoking. Findings will inform the efficacy of virtual peer-to-peer support groups for quitting smoking and potentially elucidate gender differences in quit rates found in prior research.

Therefore, the implementation of a mHealth intervention designed for psychiatric PTSD patients as a therapy add-on may improve treatment outcome. No study to date has explored the effects of mHealth interventions for PTSD in the Danish mental health sector, the feasibility and effect of this type of intervention needs testing. METHODS: The study is an investigator-initiated randomized controlled feasibility trial investigating the clinical mHealth tool PTSD help combined with care as usual (CAU) compared to CAU for adults with PTSD. Seventy patients will be recruited and receive either the mHealth intervention combined with CAU or CAU alone. The primary feasibility outcome is the proportion of eligible patients that participate in the study until the end assessment. Secondary outcome data consists of the fraction of compliant patients in the experimental group and exploratory data on PTSD help on PTSD symptom severity, level of psychological distress, sleep quality, dissociation symptoms, therapy readiness, quality of life, disability levels, and recovery. DISCUSSION: This study may help increase our knowledge of possible benefits of, as well as potential barriers to, the implementation of mHealth tools in the psychiatric sector. It may also provide a cost-efficient means to increase therapy outcomes and decrease the duration of suffering for PTSD patients in the psychiatric sector.

Referring to the committee law  section sign2, the National Committee on Health Research Ethics (DNVK) [H-18024180] decided that the study could proceed without approval as the use of PTSD help did not constitute a health science intervention according to Danish health science legislation."
A Mobile Health App to Improve HIV Medication Adherence: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Ramsey S, Ames E, Uber J, Habib S, Clark S.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Nov 13;8(11):e15356. doi: 10.2196/15356.,Ramsey S,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/11/14,PMC6881780,,10.2196/15356,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for allowing persons living with HIV to live longer, healthier lives. However, a large portion of this population has suboptimal adherence and are not virally suppressed. Conventional interventions aimed at improving ART adherence lack portability and scalability, and improvements in adherence are not often sustained. Mobile health (mHealth) ART interventions offer a low-cost and accessible method of improving adherence, but many have limited functionality and do not offer comprehensive support. The combination of an mHealth intervention with a face-to-face adherence intervention and interactive health coaching feature may offer sufficient support in a manner that is sensitive to resource limitations that are often found in HIV treatment settings. This paper details the protocol of a study designed to evaluate the potential of an enhanced mHealth intervention for improving ART adherence. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the Fitbit Plus app enhanced with a face-to-face LifeSteps session (Fitbit Plus condition) for improving ART adherence. In addition, we will determine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention by calculating treatment effect sizes. METHODS: This study will be conducted in 2 phases. The intervention will be developed and piloted with a small group of participants during phase 1. Pilot participants will provide feedback that will be used to refine the intervention for phase 2. In phase 2, a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing Fitbit Plus with a condition that approximates the standard of care (SOC) will be conducted with 60 persons living with HIV. Interviews will be conducted with RCT participants at baseline, and follow-up interviews will be conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. ART adherence is the primary outcome and will be monitored throughout the study via electronic pill boxes. Effect sizes will be generated using a fractional logit model estimated by generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Phase 1 of this trial is complete; data collection for phase 2 is ongoing. Follow-ups with enrolled participants will conclude in January 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the literature on ART adherence and may produce an efficacious intervention. Owing to a small sample size, there may be insufficient power to detect statistically significant differences between Fitbit Plus and SOC. However, if Fitbit Plus is found to be acceptable and feasible and yields promising effect size estimates, this pilot study could serve as the foundation for a larger, fully powered trial of Fitbit Plus.

Internet-Based Individualized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Shift Work Sleep Disorder Empowered by Well-Being Prediction: Protocol for a Pilot Study,"Ito-Masui A, Kawamoto E, Sakamoto R, Yu H, Sano A, Motomura E, Tanii H, Sakano S, Esumi R, Imai H, Shimaoka M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Mar 18;10(3):e24799. doi: 10.2196/24799.,Ito-Masui A,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/02/24,PMC8088862,,10.2196/24799,"BACKGROUND: Shift work sleep disorders (SWSDs) are associated with the high turnover rates of nurses, and are considered a major medical safety issue. However, initial management can be hampered by insufficient awareness. In recent years, it has become possible to visualize, collect, and analyze the work-life balance of health care workers with irregular sleeping and working habits using wearable sensors that can continuously monitor biometric data under real-life settings. In addition, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for psychiatric disorders has been shown to be effective. Application of wearable sensors and machine learning may potentially enhance the beneficial effects of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate the effect of a new internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for SWSD (iCBTS). This system includes current methods such as medical sleep advice, as well as machine learning well-being prediction to improve the sleep durations of shift workers and prevent declines in their well-being. METHODS: This study consists of two phases: (1) preliminary data collection and machine learning for well-being prediction; (2) intervention and evaluation of iCBTS for SWSD. Shift workers in the intensive care unit at Mie University Hospital will wear a wearable sensor that collects biometric data and answer daily questionnaires regarding their well-being. They will subsequently be provided with an iCBTS app for 4 weeks. Sleep and well-being measurements between baseline and the intervention period will be compared. RESULTS: Recruitment for phase 1 ended in October 2019. Recruitment for phase 2 has started in October 2020. Preliminary results are expected to be available by summer 2021. CONCLUSIONS: iCBTS empowered with well-being prediction is expected to improve the sleep durations of shift workers, thereby enhancing their overall well-being. Findings of this study will reveal the potential of this system for improving sleep disorders among shift workers.

Implementation of digital health interventions in rehabilitation: A scoping review,"Pearce L, Costa N, Sherrington C, Hassett L.",Clin Rehabil. 2023 Nov;37(11):1533-1551. doi: 10.1177/02692155231172299. Epub 2023 May 2.,Pearce L,Clin Rehabil,2023,2023/05/03,,,10.1177/02692155231172299,"OBJECTIVE: Digital health interventions have potential to enhance rehabilitation services by increasing accessibility, affordability and scalability. However, implementation of digital interventions in rehabilitation is poorly understood. This scoping review aims to map current strategies, research designs, frameworks, outcomes and determinants used to support and evaluate the implementation of digital interventions in rehabilitation. DATA SOURCES: Comprehensive searches from inception until October 2022 of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDro, SpeechBITE, NeuroBITE, REHABDATA, WHO International Clinical Trial Registry and the Cochrane Library. METHODS: Two reviewers screened studies against the eligibility criteria. Implementation science taxonomies and methods, including Powell et al.'s compilation of implementation strategies, were used to guide analysis and synthesis of findings. RESULTS: The search retrieved 13,833 papers and 23 studies were included. Only 4 studies were randomised controlled trials and 9 studies (39%) were feasibility studies. Thirty-seven discrete implementation strategies were reported across studies. Strategies related to training and educating clinicians (91%), providing interactive assistance (61%), and developing stakeholder interrelationships (43%) were most frequently reported. Few studies adequately described implementation strategies and methods for selecting strategies. Almost all studies measured implementation outcomes and determinants; most commonly, acceptability, compatibility and dose delivered of digital interventions. CONCLUSION: The rigour of implementation methods in the field is currently poor. Digital interventions require carefully planned and tailored implementation to facilitate successful adoption into rehabilitation practice. To keep pace with rapidly advancing technology, future rehabilitation research should prioritise using implementation science methods to explore and evaluate implementation while testing effectiveness of digital interventions."
Additive effects of adjunctive app-based interventions for mental disorders - A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"Fuhrmann LM, Weisel KK, Harrer M, Kulke JK, Baumeister H, Cuijpers P, Ebert DD, Berking M.",Internet Interv. 2023 Dec 18;35:100703. doi: 10.1016/j.invent.2023.100703. eCollection 2024 Mar.,Fuhrmann LM,Internet Interv,2023,2024/01/16,PMC10788289,,10.1016/j.invent.2023.100703,"BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether app-based interventions add value to existing mental health care. OBJECTIVE: To examine the incremental effects of app-based interventions when used as adjunct to mental health interventions. METHODS: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases on September 15th, 2023, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on mental health interventions with an adjunct app-based intervention compared to the same intervention-only arm for adults with mental disorders or respective clinically relevant symptomatology. We conducted meta-analyses on symptoms of different mental disorders at postintervention. PROSPERO, CRD42018098545. RESULTS: We identified 46 RCTs (4869 participants). Thirty-two adjunctive app-based interventions passively or actively monitored symptoms and behaviour, and in 13 interventions, the monitored data were sent to a therapist. We found additive effects on symptoms of depression (g = 0.17; 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.33; k = 7 comparisons), anxiety (g = 0.80; 95 % CI 0.06 to 1.54; k = 3), mania (g = 0.2; 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.38; k = 4), smoking cessation (g = 0.43; 95 % CI 0.29 to 0.58; k = 10), and alcohol use (g = 0.23; 95 % CI 0.08 to 0.39; k = 7). No significant effects were found on symptoms of depression within a bipolar disorder (g = -0.07; 95 % CI -0.37 to 0.23, k = 4) and eating disorders (g = -0.02; 95 % CI -0.44 to 0.4, k = 3). Studies on depression, mania, smoking, and alcohol use had a low heterogeneity between the trials. For other mental disorders, only single studies were identified. Only ten studies had a low risk of bias, and 25 studies reported insufficient statistical power. DISCUSSION: App-based interventions may be used to enhance mental health interventions to further reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, mania, smoking, and alcohol use. However, the effects were small, except for anxiety, and limited due to study quality. Further high-quality research with larger sample sizes is warranted to better understand how app-based interventions can be most effectively combined with established interventions to improve outcomes."

We sought to synthesise and assess the quality of the evidence on the feasibility of mHealth-based interventions for depression in Latin America. We conducted a literature search of studies published in 2007 and after using four electronic databases. We included peer-reviewed articles, in English, Spanish or Portuguese, that evaluated interventions for depressive symptoms. Two authors independently extracted data using forms developed a priori. We assessed appropriateness of reporting utilising the CONSORT checklist for feasibility trials. Eight manuscripts were included for full data extraction. Appropriate reporting varied greatly. Most (n = 6, 75%) of studies were conducted in primary care settings and sought to deliver psychoeducation or behaviour change interventions for depressive symptoms. We found great heterogeneity in the assessment of feasibility. Two studies used comparator conditions. mHealth research for depression in Latin America is scarce. Included studies showed some feasibility despite methodological inconsistencies. Given the dire need for evidence-based mental health interventions in this region, governments and stakeholders must continue promoting and funding research tailored to cultural and population characteristics with subsequent pragmatic clinical trials."
"Reducing sick leave, improving work ability, and quality of life in patients with mild to moderate Long COVID through psychosocial, physiotherapeutic, and nutritive supportive digital intervention (MiLoCoDaS): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Krotz A, Sosnowsky-Waschek N, Bechtel S, Neumann C, Lohkamp M, Kovacs G, Genser B, Fischer JE.",Trials. 2023 Dec 8;24(1):798. doi: 10.1186/s13063-023-07819-7.,Krotz A,Trials,2023,2023/12/09,PMC10709981,,10.1186/s13063-023-07819-7,"BACKGROUND: Following ﻿SARS-CoV-2 infection, a relevant proportion of patients suffer from persistent or recurring sequela, even after initially mild primary illness. Many patients experience exhaustion and fatigue, rendering them incapable of working. Long COVID exerts a substantial burden on society and the healthcare system: at least 65 million people are currently affected worldwide. The underlying pathobiology is a complex derangement in several organ systems. To date, causal pharmaceutical therapies remain elusive. Waiting lists for specialist care are long. Rapidly scalable digital interventions offering support for the frequent subgroup of patients with mild to moderate impairment from Long COVID are urgently needed. The MiLoCoDaS study compares three intensities of a potentially rapidly scalable digital intervention aiming to accelerate recovery. The overall objective is to figure out if there is a difference in the effect sizes between these modalities. METHODS: The online intervention uses a learning platform (LMS, TYPO3 framework) comprising 12 sessions of medical, psychological, physiotherapeutic, and nutritional content. The three modalities differ as follows: patient information only (sham intervention, control), information plus interactive digital workbook including practical exercises (digital intervention), and the digital workbook augmented by once-weekly online seminars and discussion groups (person and peer-contact). Eligible patients are 18-67 years old satisfying Long COVID diagnostic criteria. Patients are recruited through primary care physicians and randomly allocated. The primary endpoint is the number of sick leave days during the 6-month observation period; secondary endpoints are patient-reported symptoms, quality of life, and work ability. The study size provides a power of 80% at a type I error of < 0.05 to show an effect size of Cohen = 0.3 between the augmented and the sham intervention (N = 152 per arm, total accounting for attrition N = 600). DISCUSSION: If one of the two interventions is superior to providing information alone, MiLoCoDaS would provide the starting point for a rapidly scalable digital intervention for the frequent and currently underserved patient group with mild to moderate impairment from Long COVID. Several caveats pertain to the heterogeneity of Long COVID manifestation and duration prior to inclusion. It is conceivable that the possible effect of the intervention may differ across subgroups. Therefore, a priori defined secondary analysis will be conducted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) DRKS00028964. Registered on 24 August 2022."

Romania has a particularly high HIV incidence, AIDS prevalence, and number of related deaths. HIV incidence in Romania is largely attributed to sexual contact among gay and bisexual men. However, homophobic stigma in Romania serves as a risk factor for HIV infection for gay and bisexual men. The Comunica intervention aims to provide a much-needed HIV risk reduction strategy, and it entails the delivery of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy skills across 8 live text-based counseling sessions on a mobile platform to gay and bisexual men at risk of HIV. The intervention is based on the information-motivation-behavior and minority stress models. There is preliminary evidence suggesting that Comunica holds promise for reducing gay and bisexual men's co-occurring sexual (eg, HIV transmission risk behavior), behavioral (eg, heavy alcohol use), and mental (eg, depression) health risks in Romania. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of Comunica in a national trial. METHODS: To test Comunica's efficacy, 305 gay and bisexual men were randomized to receive Comunica or a content-matched education attention control condition. The control condition consisted of 8 time-matched educational modules that present information regarding gay and bisexual men's identity development, information about HIV transmission and prevention, the importance of HIV and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, heavy alcohol use and its associations with HIV transmission risk behavior, sexual health communication, finding social support, and creating sexual health goals. Participants undergo rapid HIV and syphilis testing and 3-site chlamydia and gonorrhea testing at baseline and the 12-month follow-up. Outcomes are measured before the intervention (baseline) and at the 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: The study was funded in September 2018, and data collection began in May 2019. The last participant follow-up was in January 2024. Currently, the data analyst is cleaning data sets in preparation for data analyses, which are scheduled to begin in April 2024. Data analysis meetings are scheduled regularly to establish timelines and examine the results as analyses are gradually being conducted. Upon completion, a list of manuscripts will be reviewed and prioritized, and the team will begin preparing them for publication. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to test the efficacy of an intervention with the potential to simultaneously support the sexual, behavioral, and mental health of gay and bisexual men in Central and Eastern Europe using motivational interviewing support and sensitivity to the high-stigma context of the region. If efficacious, Comunica presents a scalable platform to provide support to gay and bisexual men living in Romania and similar high-stigma, low-resource countries.

Few culturally tailored mobile health (mHealth) programs were designed for these vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: This study reports the development of a culturally tailored mHealth program called Wellness Enhancement for Caregivers (WECARE) to improve caregiving skills, reduce distress, and improve the psychosocial well-being of Chinese American family caregivers of persons with dementia. METHODS: Community-based user-centered design principles were applied in the program development. First, the structure and curriculum of the WECARE program were crafted based on existing evidence-based interventions for caregivers with input from 4 experts. Second, through working closely with 8 stakeholders, we culturally adapted evidence-based programs into multimedia program components. Lastly, 5 target users tested the initial WECARE program; their experience and feedback were used to further refine the program. RESULTS: The resulting WECARE is a 7-week mHealth program delivered via WeChat, a social media app highly popular in Chinese Americans. By subscribing to the official WECARE account, users can receive 6 interactive multimedia articles pushed to their WeChat accounts each week for 7 weeks. The 7 major themes include (1) facts of dementia and caregiving; (2) the enhancement of caregiving skills; (3) effective communication with health care providers, care partners, and family members; (4) problem-solving skills for caregiving stress management; (5) stress reduction and depression prevention; (6) the practice of self-care and health behaviors; and (7) social support and available resources. Users also have the option of joining group chats for peer support. The WECARE program also includes a back-end database that manages intervention delivery and tracks user engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The WECARE program represents one of the first culturally tailored social media-based interventions for Chinese American caregivers of persons with dementia. It demonstrates the use of community-based user-centered design principles in developing an mHealth intervention program in underserved communities. We call for more cultural adaptation and development of mHealth interventions for immigrant and racial/ethnic minority caregivers of persons with dementia."

In recent years, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, there has been a proliferation of online interventions with promising results. The purpose of the present study is twofold: to test the effectiveness of an online, self-guided intervention, MINDxYOU, to reduce the stress levels of healthcare workers; and to conduct an implementation study of this intervention. Additionally, an economic evaluation of the intervention will be conducted. METHODS: The current study has a hybrid effectiveness-implementation type 2 design. A stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design will be used, with a cohort of 180 healthcare workers recruited in two Spanish provinces (Malaga and Zaragoza). The recruitment stage will commence in October 2022. Frontline health workers who provide direct care to people in a hospital, primary care center, or nursing home setting in both regions will participate. The effectiveness of the intervention will be studied, with perceived stress as the main outcome (Perceived Stress Scale), while other psychopathological symptoms and process variables (e.g., mindfulness, compassion, resilience, and psychological flexibility) will be also assessed as secondary outcomes. The implementation study will include analysis of feasibility, acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability. The incremental costs and benefits, in terms of quality-adjusted life years, will be examined by means of cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses. DISCUSSION: MINDxYOU is designed to reduce healthcare workers' stress levels through the practice of mindfulness, acceptance, and compassion, with a special focus on how to apply these skills to healthy habits and considering the particular stressors that these professionals face on a daily basis. The present study will show how implementation studies are useful for establishing the framework in which to address barriers to and promote facilitators for acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability of online interventions. The ultimate goal is to reduce the research-to-practice gap. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on 29/06/2022; registration number: NCT05436717."
A Digital Substance-Use Harm Reduction Intervention for Students in Higher Education (MyUSE): Protocol for Project Development,"Dick S, Vasiliou VS, Davoren MP, Dockray S, Heavin C, Linehan C, Byrne M.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Aug 27;9(8):e17829. doi: 10.2196/17829.,Dick S,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/08/28,PMC7484779,,10.2196/17829,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions have been identified as a possible tool for reducing the harm caused by illicit drug use among students attending higher education (ie, college students). However, the success of interventions in this area has been hampered by a lack of user involvement and behavior change theory in their design. The My Understanding of Substance use Experiences (MyUSE) project combines a rigorous user-centered design (UCD) methodology and a robust behavioral change framework to develop a digitally delivered harm reduction intervention for illicit drug use among students in higher education. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to design and develop a digital intervention that targets drug use-related harm among students in higher education. METHODS: The MyUSE project will take place over 3 phases. The first phase was exploratory in nature, involving 3 systematic reviews, a large survey, and student workshops to gather a comprehensive evidence base to guide the project. The second phase is the development stage of the project, involving the use of the Behavior Change Wheel theoretical framework to determine the behavior change techniques of the intervention and the use of the UCD methodology to guide the development of the digital intervention. The third phase is the evaluation stage, whereby the intervention will undergo a 5-stage evaluation process to comprehensively evaluate its impacts. RESULTS: The exploratory phase 1 of the MyUSE project was completed in December 2018. Phase 2 is currently underway, and phase 3 is due to begin in September 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Higher education institutions (HEIs) are ideally placed to intervene and support students in the area of illicit drug use but are constrained by limited resources. Current digital interventions in this area are sparse and have several weaknesses. The MyUSE project combines a UCD approach with a robust behavior change framework to develop a digitally delivered intervention that is economically viable, effective in changing behavior, usable and acceptable to students, and able to sustain long-term implementation in HEIs.

Long, complex treatment regimens coupled with frequent adverse events have resulted in poor treatment adherence and patient outcomes. Smartphone-based mobile health (mHealth) technologies offer national TB programmes an appealing platform to improve patient care and management; however, clinical trial evidence to support their use is lacking. This trial will test the hypothesis that an mHealth intervention can improve treatment success among patients with MDR-TB and is cost-effective compared with standard practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A community-based, open-label, parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be conducted among patients treated for MDR-TB in seven provinces of Vietnam. Patients commencing therapy for microbiologically confirmed rifampicin-resistant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis within the past 30 days will be recruited to the study. Participants will be individually randomised to an intervention arm, comprising use of an mHealth application for treatment support, or a 'standard care' arm. In both arms, patients will be managed by the national TB programme according to current national treatment guidelines. The primary outcome measure of effectiveness will be the proportion of patients with treatment success (defined as treatment completion and/or bacteriological cure) after 24 months. A marginal Poisson regression model estimated via a generalised estimating equation will be used to test the effect of the intervention on treatment success. A prospective microcosting of the intervention and within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will also be undertaken from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness will be presented as an incremental cost per patient successfully treated and an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. ETHICS: Ethical approval for the study was granted by The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (2019/676). DISSEMINATION: Study findings will be disseminated to participants and published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12620000681954."

Chile's high utilization of digital technologies across all social strata and the increased use of pregnancy and parenting apps open the possibility of delivering interventions through mobile devices. Cognitive-behavioral internet-based interventions have proven to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression in high-income countries. However, in Chile, this is an underdeveloped field. This manuscript describes a randomized controlled trial protocol that will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a guided 8-week cognitive-behavioral app-based intervention for Chilean postpartum women with depressive symptoms. METHOD: A small-scale parallel 2-arms trial will be conducted. Postpartum women with minor or major depression will be randomized to the app-based intervention or waitlist. The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability variables, mainly; recruitment and eligibility rates, intervention and study adherence, and participants' intervention satisfaction, use, and engagement. Semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample will provide more information about the participants' experience with the intervention. Women's depression status will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Other secondary outcomes will include participants' perceived social support, mother-infant bonding, and maternal satisfaction and self-efficacy. DISCUSSION: This will be the first internet-based intervention aimed at reducing postpartum depression symptoms developed and studied in Chile. If the intervention and procedures prove feasible and acceptable, we plan to study its efficacy in a definitive controlled trial. If the intervention demonstrates to be effective, the aim is to implement it within the Chilean healthcare setting."
"Investigating the Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness of Technology-Delivered Personalized Feedback on Dietary Patterns in Young Australian Adults in the Advice, Ideas, and Motivation for My Eating (Aim4Me) Study: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Haslam RL, Pezdirc K, Truby H, Attia J, Hutchesson M, Burrows T, Callister R, Hides L, Bonevski B, Kerr DA, Lubans D, Kirkpatrick S, Rollo M, McCaffrey T, Collins CE.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 May 22;9(5):e15999. doi: 10.2196/15999.,Haslam RL,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/05/23,PMC7275255,,10.2196/15999,"BACKGROUND: Web-based health interventions may be easier to access and time efficient relative to face-to-face interventions and therefore may be the most appropriate mode to engage young adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the impact of 3 different levels of personalized web-based dietary feedback and support on changes in diet quality. METHODS: The Advice, Ideas, and Motivation for My Eating (Aim4Me) study is a 12-month assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of 3 levels of web-based feedback on diet quality, measured using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS). Participants (N=2570) will primarily be recruited via web-based methods and randomized to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 (control) will receive the Healthy Eating Quiz, a web-based dietary assessment tool that generates a brief feedback report on diet quality. Individuals randomized to this group can use the brief feedback report to make positive dietary changes. Group 2 will receive the Australian Eating Survey, a web-based dietary assessment tool that generates a comprehensive feedback report on diet quality as well as macro- and micronutrient intake. Group 2 will use the comprehensive feedback report to assist in making positive dietary changes. They will also have access to the Aim4Me website with resources on healthy eating and tools to set goals and self-monitor progress. Group 3 will receive the same intervention as Group 2 (ie, the comprehensive feedback report) in addition to a tailored 30-min video consultation with an accredited practicing dietitian who will use the comprehensive feedback report to assist individuals in making positive dietary changes. The self-determination theory was used as the framework for selecting appropriate website features, including goal setting and self-monitoring. The primary outcome measure is change in diet quality. The completion of questionnaires at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months will be incentivized with a monetary prize draw. RESULTS: As of December 2019, 1277 participants have been randomized. CONCLUSIONS: The web-based delivery of nutrition interventions has the potential to improve dietary intake of young adults. However, the level of support required to improve intake is unknown.

Sustainable diets could solve both problems together. This study protocol aims to develop a three-stage, 15-week mHealth randomised controlled trial of a sustainable-psycho-nutritional intervention programme to promote Mexican population adherence to a sustainable diet and to evaluate its effects on health and environmental outcomes. In stage 1, the programme will be designed using the sustainable diets, behaviour change wheel and capability, opportunity, motivation, and behaviour (COM-B) models. A sustainable food guide, recipes, meal plans and a mobile application will be developed. In stage 2, the intervention will be implemented for 7 weeks, and a 7-week follow-up period in a young Mexican adults (18-35 years) sample, randomly divided (1:1 ratio) into a control group (n 50) and an experimental group (n 50), will be divided into two arms at week 8. Outcomes will include health, nutrition, environment, behaviour and nutritional-sustainable knowledge. Additionally, socio-economics and culture will be considered. Thirteen behavioural objectives will be included using successive approaches in online workshops twice a week. The population will be monitored using the mobile application consisting of behavioural change techniques. In stage 3, the effects of the intervention will be assessed using mixed-effects models on dietary intake and quality, nutritional status, physical activity, metabolic biomarkers (serum glucose and lipid profile), gut microbiota composition and dietary water and carbon footprints of the evaluated population. Improvements in health outcomes and a decrease in dietary water and carbon footprints are expected."
Improving Adherence to Web-Based and Mobile Technologies for People With Psychosis: Systematic Review of New Potential Predictors of Adherence,"Killikelly C, He Z, Reeder C, Wykes T.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2017 Jul 20;5(7):e94. doi: 10.2196/mhealth.7088.,Killikelly C,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2017,2017/07/22,PMC5544896,,10.2196/mhealth.7088,"BACKGROUND: Despite the boom in new technologically based interventions for people with psychosis, recent studies suggest medium to low rates of adherence to these types of interventions. The benefits will be limited if only a minority of service users adhere and engage; if specific predictors of adherence can be identified then technologies can be adapted to increase the service user benefits. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to present a systematic review of rates of adherence, dropout, and approaches to analyzing adherence to newly developed mobile and Web-based interventions for people with psychosis. Specific predictors of adherence were also explored. METHODS: Using keywords (Internet or online or Web-based or website or mobile) AND (bipolar disorder or manic depression or manic depressive illness or manic-depressive psychosis or psychosis or schizophr* or psychotic), the following databases were searched: OVID including MedLine, EMBASE and PsychInfo, Pubmed and Web of Science. The objectives and inclusion criteria for suitable studies were defined following PICOS (population: people with psychosis; intervention: mobile or Internet-based technology; comparison group: no comparison group specified; outcomes: measures of adherence; study design: randomized controlled trials (RCT), feasibility studies, and observational studies) criteria. In addition to measurement and analysis of adherence, two theoretically proposed predictors of adherence were examined: (1) level of support from a clinician or researcher throughout the study, and (2) level of service user involvement in the app or intervention development. We provide a narrative synthesis of the findings and followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. RESULTS: Of the 20 studies that reported a measure of adherence and a rate of dropout, 5 of these conducted statistical analyses to determine predictors of dropout, 6 analyzed the effects of specific adherence predictors (eg, symptom severity or type of technological interface) on the effects of the intervention, 4 administered poststudy feedback questionnaires to assess continued use of the intervention, and 2 studies evaluated the effects of different types of interventions on adherence. Overall, the percentage of participants adhering to interventions ranged from 28-100% with a mean of 83%. Adherence was greater in studies with higher levels of social support and service user involvement in the development of the intervention. Studies of shorter duration also had higher rates of adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to mobile and Web-based interventions was robust across most studies. Although 2 studies found specific predictors of nonadherence (male gender and younger age), most did not specifically analyze predictors. The duration of the study may be an important predictor of adherence. Future studies should consider reporting a universal measure of adherence and aim to conduct complex analyses on predictors of adherence such as level of social presence and service user involvement."
Leveraging Digital Technology to Support Pregnant and Early Parenting Women in Recovery from Addictive Substances: A Scoping Review,"Raynor P, Corbett C, West D, Johnston D, Eichelberger K, Litwin A, Guille C, Prinz R.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2023 Mar 2;20(5):4457. doi: 10.3390/ijerph20054457.,Raynor P,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2023,2023/03/11,PMC10002058,,10.3390/ijerph20054457,"Little is known about digital health interventions used to support treatment for pregnant and early parenting women (PEPW) with substance use disorders (SUD). METHODS: Guided by the Arksey and O'Malley's Scoping Review Framework, empirical studies were identified within the CINAHL, PsycInfo, PubMed, and ProQuest databases using subject headings and free-text keywords. Studies were selected based on a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria, and data extraction and descriptive analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 27 original studies and 30 articles were included. Varying study designs were used, including several feasibility and acceptability studies. However, efficacious findings on abstinence and other clinically important outcomes were reported in several studies. Most studies focused on digital interventions for pregnant women (89.7%), suggesting a dearth of research on how digital technologies may support early parenting women with SUD. No studies included PEPW family members or involved PEPW women in the intervention design. CONCLUSIONS: The science of digital interventions to support treatment for PEPW is in an early stage, but feasibility and efficacy results are promising. Future research should explore community-based participatory partnerships with PEPW to develop or tailor digital interventions and include family or external support systems to engage in the intervention alongside PEPW."
Outcomes of Best-Practice Guided Digital Mental Health Interventions for Youth and Young Adults with Emerging Symptoms: Part II. A Systematic Review of User Experience Outcomes,"Opie JE, Vuong A, Welsh ET, Esler TB, Khan UR, Khalil H.",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev. 2024 Apr 18. doi: 10.1007/s10567-024-00468-5. Online ahead of print.,Opie JE,Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,2024,2024/04/18,,,10.1007/s10567-024-00468-5,"Although many young people demonstrate resilience and strength, research and clinical evidence highlight an upward trend in mental health concerns among those aged 12 to 25 years. Youth-specific digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) aim to address this trend by providing timely access to mental health support for young people (12-25 years). However, there is a considerable gap in understanding young people user experiences with digital interventions. This review, co-designed with Australia's leading mental health organization Beyond Blue, utilizes a systematic methodology to synthesize evidence on user experience in youth-oriented digital mental health interventions that are fully or partially guided. Five relevant online databases were searched for articles published from 2018 to 2023, yielding 22,482 articles for screening and 22 studies were included in the present analysis. User experience outcomes relating to satisfaction and engagement were assessed for each included intervention, with experience indicators relating to usefulness, usability, value, credibility, and desirability being examined. Elements associated with positive/negative outcomes were extracted. Elements shown to positively influence user experience included peer engagement, modern app-based delivery, asynchronous support, and personalized content. In contrast, users disliked static content, homework/log-keeping, the requirement for multiple devices, and social media integration. Asynchronous interventions showed high satisfaction but faced engagement issues, with combined asynchronous/synchronous interventions reporting better completion rates. DMHIs offer a promising platform for youth mental health support and has the potential to dramatically increase the reach of interventions through the adoption of technological and user experience best practices. While young people respond positively to many aspects of intervention modernization, such as interactive, app-based design, other concepts, such as social media integration, they need to be adopted by the field more cautiously to ensure trust and engagement.Trial Registration CRD42023405812."

A growing body of evidence demonstrates that skills for increasing positive emotion can be helpful to individuals with depression. Although Web-based interventions to reduce negative emotion in individuals with depression are available, these interventions frequently suffer from poor retention and adherence and do not capitalize on the potential benefits of increasing positive emotion. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and test a Web-based positive emotion skills intervention tailored for individuals living with elevated depressive symptoms, as well as to develop and test enhancement strategies for increasing retention and adherence to that intervention. METHODS: This study protocol describes the development and testing for Mobile Affect Regulation Intervention with the Goal of Lowering Depression (MARIGOLD), a Web-based positive emotion skills intervention, adapted for individuals with elevated depressive symptomatology. The intervention development is taking place in three phases. In phase 1, we are tailoring an existing positive emotion skills intervention for individuals with elevated symptoms of depression and are pilot testing the tailored version of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial with two control conditions (N=60). In phase 2, we are developing and testing three enhancements aimed at boosting retention and adherence to the Web-based intervention (N=75): facilitator contact, an online discussion board, and virtual badges. In phase 3, we are conducting a multifactorial, nine-arm pilot trial (N=600) to systematically test these enhancement strategies, individually and in combination. The primary outcome is depressive symptom severity. Secondary outcomes include positive and negative emotion, psychological well-being, and coping resources. RESULTS: The project was funded in August 2014, and data collection was completed in May 2018. Data analysis is currently under way, and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this investigation will enable us to develop an optimal package of intervention content and enhancement strategies for individuals with elevated symptoms of depression. If this intervention proves to be effective, it will provide a cost-effective, anonymous, appealing, and flexible approach for reducing symptoms of depression and improving psychological adjustment through increasing positive emotion.

Implementing online interventions may be an effective way to reach young people, given their familiarity with technology. OBJECTIVE: This study will assess the effectiveness of a website called the ""Online Wellbeing Centre (OWC),"" designed for the support and improvement of mental health and well-being in young Australians aged between 16 and 25 years. As the active component of the study, the OWC will introduce a self-guided app recommendation service called ""The Toolbox: The best apps for your brain and body"" developed by ReachOut.com. The Toolbox is a responsive website that serves as a personalized, ongoing recommendation service for technology-based tools and apps to improve well-being. It allows users to personalize their experience according to their individual needs. METHODS: This study will be a two-arm, randomized controlled trial following a wait-list control design. The primary outcome will be changes in psychological well-being measured by the Mental Health Continuum Short Form. The secondary outcomes will be drawn from a subsample of participants and will include depression scores measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and quality of life measured by the Assessment of Quality of Life-four dimensions (AQOL-4D) index. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted based on a primary outcome of cost per unique visit to the OWC. Utility-based outcomes will also be incorporated into the analysis allowing a secondary outcome to be cost per quality-adjusted life year gained (based on the AQOL-4D values). Resource use associated with both the intervention and control groups will be collected using a customized questionnaire. Online- and community-based recruitment strategies will be implemented, and the effectiveness of each approach will be analyzed. Participants will be recruited from the general Australian population and randomized online. The trial will last for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Small but clinically significant increases in well-being symptoms are expected to be detected in the intervention group compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: If this intervention proves to be effective, it will have an impact on the future design and implementation of online-based well-being interventions as a valid and cost-effective way to support mental health clinical treatment. Findings regarding recruitment effectiveness will also contribute to developing better ways to engage this population in research.

Digital interventions for healthy ageing and cognitive health in older adults: a systematic review of mixed method studies and meta-analysis,"Tsai YI, Beh J, Ganderton C, Pranata A.",BMC Geriatr. 2024 Mar 4;24(1):217. doi: 10.1186/s12877-023-04617-3.,Tsai YI,BMC Geriatr,2024,2024/03/04,PMC10910826,,10.1186/s12877-023-04617-3,"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of digital interventions for healthy ageing and cognitive health of older adults. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of digital intervention studies for facilitating healthy ageing and cognitive health and further identify the considerations of its application to older adults. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature were conducted across CINAHL, Medline, ProQuest, Cochrane, Scopus, and PubMed databases following the PRISMA guideline. All included studies were appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Checklist by independent reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed using JBI SUMARI software to compare quantitative studies. Thematic analyses were used for qualitative studies and synthesised into the emerging themes. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. Quantitative results showed no statistically significant pooled effect between health knowledge and healthy behaviour (I(2) =76, p=0.436, 95% CI [-0.32,0.74]), and between cardiovascular-related health risks and care dependency I(2)=0, p=0.426, 95% CI [0.90,1.29]). However, a statistically significant cognitive function preservation was found in older adults who had long-term use of laptop/cellphone devices and had engaged in the computer-based physical activity program (I(2)=0, p<0.001, 95% CI [0.01, 0.21]). Qualitative themes for the considerations of digital application to older adults were digital engagement, communication, independence, human connection, privacy, and cost. CONCLUSIONS: Digital interventions used in older adults to facilitate healthy ageing were not always effective. Health knowledge improvement does not necessarily result in health risk reduction in that knowledge translation is key. Factors influencing knowledge translation (i.e., digital engagement, human coaching etc) were identified to determine the intervention effects. However, using digital devices appeared beneficial to maintain older adults' cognitive functions in the longer term. Therefore, the review findings suggest that the expanded meaning of a person-centred concept (i.e., from social, environmental, and healthcare system aspects) should be pursued in future practice. Privacy and cost concerns of technologies need ongoing scrutiny from policy bodies. Future research looking into the respective health benefits can provide more understanding of the current digital intervention applied to older adults.

Print 2020 Mar.,Donovan E,Br J Gen Pract,2020,2020/02/12,PMC7015163,,10.3399/bjgp20X708209,"BACKGROUND: Consultations for self-limiting infections in children are increasing. It has been proposed that digital technology could be used to enable parents' decision making in terms of self-care and treatment seeking. AIM: To evaluate the evidence that digital interventions facilitate parents deciding whether to self-care or seek treatment for acute illnesses in children. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review of studies undertaken worldwide. METHOD: Searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE were made to identify studies (of any design) published between database inception and January 2019 that assessed digital interventions for parents of children (from any healthcare setting) with acute illnesses. The primary outcome of interest was whether the use of digital interventions reduced the use of urgent care services. RESULTS: Three studies were included in the review. They assessed two apps and one website: Children's On-Call - a US advice-only app; Should I See a Doctor? - a Dutch self-triage app for any acute illness; and Strategy for Off-Site Rapid Triage (SORT) for Kids - a US self-triage website for influenza-like illness. None of the studies involved parents during intervention development and it was shown that many parents did not find the two apps easy to use. The sensitivity of self-triage interventions was 84% for Should I See a Doctor? compared with nurse triage, and 93.3% for SORT for Kids compared with the need for emergency-department intervention; however, both had lower specificity (74% and 13%, respectively). None of the interventions demonstrated reduced use of urgent-care services. CONCLUSION: There is little evidence to support the use of digital interventions to help parent and/or carers looking after children with acute illness. Future research should involve parents during intervention development, and adequately powered trials are needed to assess the impact of such interventions on health services and the identification of children who are seriously ill."
Evaluation of a Web-Based Tailored Nursing Intervention (TAVIE en m@rche) Aimed at Increasing Walking After an Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial Protocol,"Kayser JW, Cossette S, Côté J, Bourbonnais A, Purden M, Juneau M, Tanguay JF, Simard MJ, Dupuis J, Diodati JG, Tremblay JF, Maheu-Cadotte MA, Cournoyer D.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2017 Apr 27;6(4):e64. doi: 10.2196/resprot.6430.,Kayser JW,JMIR Res Protoc,2017,2017/04/29,PMC5427251,,10.2196/resprot.6430,"BACKGROUND: Despite the health benefits of increasing physical activity in the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), up to 60% of ACS patients are insufficiently active. Evidence supporting the effect of Web-based interventions on increasing physical activity outcomes in ACS patients is growing. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using Web-based technologies that measured objective physical activity outcomes are sparse. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to evaluate in insufficiently active ACS patients, the effect of a fully automated, Web-based tailored nursing intervention (TAVIE en m@rche) on increasing steps per day. METHODS: A parallel two-group multicenter RCT (target N=148) is being conducted in four major teaching hospitals in Montreal, Canada. An experimental group receiving the 4-week TAVIE en m@rche intervention plus a brief ""booster"" at 8 weeks, is compared with the control group receiving hyperlinks to publicly available websites. TAVIE en m@rche is based on the Strengths-Based Nursing Care orientation to nursing practice and the Self-Determination Theory of human motivation. The intervention is centered on videos of a nurse who delivers the content tailored to baseline levels of self-reported autonomous motivation, perceived competence, and walking behavior. Participants are recruited in hospital and are eligible if they report access to a computer and report less than recommended physical activity levels 6 months before hospitalization. Most outcome data are collected online at baseline, and 5 and 12 weeks postrandomization. The primary outcome is change in accelerometer-measured steps per day between randomization and 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes include change in steps per day between randomization and 5 weeks, and change in self-reported energy expenditure for walking and moderate to vigorous physical activity between randomization, and 5 and 12 weeks. Theoretical outcomes are the mediating role of self-reported perceived autonomy support, autonomous and controlled motivations, perceived competence, and barrier self-efficacy on steps per day. Clinical outcomes are quality of life, smoking, medication adherence, secondary prevention program attendance, health care utilization, and angina frequency. The potential moderating role of sex will also be explored. Analysis of covariance models will be used with covariates such as sex, age, fatigue, and depression symptoms. Allocation sequence is concealed, and blinding will be implemented during data analysis. RESULTS: Recruitment started March 30, 2016. Data analysis is planned for November 2017. CONCLUSIONS: Finding alternative interventions aimed at increasing the adoption of health behavior changes such as physical activity in the secondary prevention of ACS is clearly needed. Our RCT is expected to help support the potential efficacy of a fully automated, Web-based tailored nursing intervention on the objective outcome of steps per day in an ACS population. If this RCT is successful, and after its implementation as part of usual care, TAVIE en m@rche could help improve the health of ACS patients at large.

This trial targets this major dietary risk factor and addresses notable gaps in the rural digital health intervention literature. iSIPsmarter is a technology-based behavior and health literacy intervention aimed at improving SSB behaviors. It is comprised of six Internet-delivered, interactive Cores delivered weekly, an integrated short message service (SMS) strategy to engage users in tracking and reporting SSB behaviors, and a cellular-enabled scale for in-home weighing. iSIPsmarter is adapted from an evidence-based intervention and is grounded by the Theory of Planned Behavior and health literacy, numeracy, and media literacy concepts. The RCT is guided by the RE-AIM framework and targets 244 rural Appalachian adults. The goal is to examine the efficacy of iSIPsmarter to reduce SSB in a two-group design [iSIPsmarter vs. static Participant Education website] with four assessment points. Changes in secondary outcomes (e.g., diet quality, weight, quality of life) and maintenance of outcomes will also be evaluated. Additional secondary aims are to examine reach and representativeness, patterns of user engagement, and cost. Two tertiary aims are exploratory mediation analyses and a systems-level, participatory evaluation to understand context for future organizational-level adoption of iSIPsmarter. The long-term goal is to sustain an effective, scalable, and high reach behavioral intervention to reduce SSB-related health inequities and related chronic conditions (i.e., obesity, diabetes, some obesity-related cancers, heart disease, hypertension, dental decay) in rural Appalachia and beyond.

With about 1 million new STIs a day globally, up-to-date evidence is urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of mobile health interventions delivered to participants for preventing STIs and promoting preventive behaviour. METHODS: We searched seven databases and reference lists of 49 related reviews (January 1990-February 2020) and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials of mobile interventions delivered to adolescents and adults to prevent sexual transmission of STIs. We conducted meta-analyses and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence following Cochrane guidance. RESULTS: After double screening 6683 records, we included 22 trials into the systematic review and 20 into meta-analyses; 18 trials used text messages, 3 used smartphone applications and 1 used Facebook messages as delivery modes. The certainty of evidence regarding intervention effects on STI/HIV occurrence and adverse events was low or very low. There was moderate certainty of evidence that in the short/medium-term text messaging interventions had little or no effect on condom use (standardised mean differences (SMD) 0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.14, nine trials), but increased STI/HIV testing (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.36, seven trials), although not if the standard-of-care control already contained an active text messaging component (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47, two trials). Smartphone application messages also increased STI/HIV testing (risk ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.60, subgroup analysis, two trials). The effects on other outcomes or of social media or blended interventions is uncertain due to low or very low certainty evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Text messaging interventions probably increase STI/HIV testing but not condom use in the short/medium term. Ongoing trials will report the effects on biological and other outcomes."
App-based maintenance treatment for alcohol use disorder after acute inpatient treatment: Study protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial,"Saur S, Weisel KK, Lang C, Fuhrmann LM, Steins-Loeber S, Enewoldsen N, Reichl D, Zink M, Jakobi F, Rudolph M, Ahnert A, Braunwarth WD, Falkai P, Koller G, Behle N, Hager L, Hillemacher T, Heepe P, Müller FN, Kraus T, Kiderman Y, Horn N, Kornhuber J, Lins S, Spitzer P, Bönsch D, Counot C, Stemmler M, Hildebrand A, Amelung V, Kerkemeyer L, Berking M.",Internet Interv. 2022 Feb 23;28:100517. doi: 10.1016/j.invent.2022.100517. eCollection 2022 Apr.,Saur S,Internet Interv,2022,2022/03/07,PMC8888955,,10.1016/j.invent.2022.100517,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder, a prevalent and disabling mental health problem, is often characterized by a chronic disease course. While effective inpatient and aftercare treatment options exist, the transferal of treatment success into everyday life is challenging and many patients remain without further assistance. App-based interventions with human guidance have great potential to support individuals after inpatient treatment, yet evidence on their efficacy remains scarce. OBJECTIVES: To develop an app-based intervention with human guidance and evaluate its usability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (DSM-5), aged 18 or higher, without history of schizophrenia, undergoing inpatient alcohol use disorder treatment (N = 356) were recruited in eight medical centres in Bavaria, Germany, between December 2019 and August 2021. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either receive access to treatment as usual plus an app-based intervention with human guidance (intervention group) or access to treatment as usual plus app-based intervention after the active study phase (waitlist control/TAU group). Telephone-based assessments are conducted by diagnostic interviewers three and six weeks as well as three and six months after randomization. The primary outcome is the relapse risk during the six months after randomization assessed via the Timeline Follow-Back Interview. Secondary outcomes include intervention usage, uptake of aftercare treatments, AUD-related psychopathology, general psychopathology, and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This study will provide further insights into the use of app-based interventions with human guidance as maintenance treatment in individuals with AUD. If shown to be efficacious, the intervention may improve AUD treatment by assisting individuals in maintaining inpatient treatment success after returning into their home setting. Due to the ubiquitous use of smartphones, the intervention has the potential to become part of routine AUD care in Germany and countries with similar healthcare systems."
Online interventions for social marketing health behavior change campaigns: a meta-analysis of psychological architectures and adherence factors,"Cugelman B, Thelwall M, Dawes P.",J Med Internet Res. 2011 Feb 14;13(1):e17. doi: 10.2196/jmir.1367.,Cugelman B,J Med Internet Res,2011,2011/02/16,PMC3221338,,10.2196/jmir.1367,"BACKGROUND: Researchers and practitioners have developed numerous online interventions that encourage people to reduce their drinking, increase their exercise, and better manage their weight. Motivations to develop eHealth interventions may be driven by the Internet's reach, interactivity, cost-effectiveness, and studies that show online interventions work. However, when designing online interventions suitable for public campaigns, there are few evidence-based guidelines, taxonomies are difficult to apply, many studies lack impact data, and prior meta-analyses are not applicable to large-scale public campaigns targeting voluntary behavioral change. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis assessed online intervention design features in order to inform the development of online campaigns, such as those employed by social marketers, that seek to encourage voluntary health behavior change. A further objective was to increase understanding of the relationships between intervention adherence, study adherence, and behavioral outcomes. METHODS: Drawing on systematic review methods, a combination of 84 query terms were used in 5 bibliographic databases with additional gray literature searches. This resulted in 1271 abstracts and papers; 31 met the inclusion criteria. In total, 29 papers describing 30 interventions were included in the primary meta-analysis, with the 2 additional studies qualifying for the adherence analysis. Using a random effects model, the first analysis estimated the overall effect size, including groupings by control conditions and time factors. The second analysis assessed the impacts of psychological design features that were coded with taxonomies from evidence-based behavioral medicine, persuasive technology, and other behavioral influence fields. These separate systems were integrated into a coding framework model called the communication-based influence components model. Finally, the third analysis assessed the relationships between intervention adherence and behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: The overall impact of online interventions across all studies was small but statistically significant (standardized mean difference effect size d=0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.11-0.28, P<.001, number of interventions k=30). The largest impact with a moderate level of efficacy was exerted from online interventions when compared with waitlists and placebos (d=0.28, 95% CI=0.17-0.39, P<.001, k=18), followed by comparison with lower-tech online interventions (d=0.16, 95% CI=0.00-0.32, P=.04, k=8); no significant difference was found when compared with sophisticated print interventions (d=-0.11, 95% CI=-0.34 to 0.12, P=.35, k=4), though online interventions offer a small effect with the advantage of lower costs and larger reach. Time proved to be a critical factor, with shorter interventions generally achieving larger impacts and greater adherence. For psychological design, most interventions drew from the transtheoretical approach and were goal orientated, deploying numerous influence components aimed at showing users the consequences of their behavior, assisting them in reaching goals, and providing normative pressure. Inconclusive results suggest a relationship between the number of influence components and intervention efficacy. Despite one contradictory correlation, the evidence suggests that study adherence, intervention adherence, and behavioral outcomes are correlated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that online interventions have the capacity to influence voluntary behaviors, such as those routinely targeted by social marketing campaigns. Given the high reach and low cost of online technologies, the stage may be set for increased public health campaigns that blend interpersonal online systems with mass-media outreach. Such a combination of approaches could help individuals achieve personal goals that, at an individual level, help citizens improve the quality of their lives and at a state level, contribute to healthier societies."
Internet-Based Interventions for the Prevention and Treatment of Mental Disorders in Latin America: A Scoping Review,"Jiménez-Molina Á, Franco P, Martínez V, Martínez P, Rojas G, Araya R.",Front Psychiatry. 2019 Sep 13;10:664. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00664. eCollection 2019.,Jiménez-Molina Á,Front Psychiatry,2019,2019/10/02,PMC6753742,,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00664,"Background: There is a huge gap in the treatment of mental disorders in Latin America, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Given the sharp increase in Internet access and the rapid penetration of smartphones in the region, the use of Internet-based technologies might potentially contribute to overcoming this gap and to provide more widely distributed and low-cost mental health care in a variety of contexts. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of the literature in order to systematically map the existing evidence on use of Internet-based interventions for prevention, treatment, and management of mental disorders across Latin American countries, as well as to identify existing gaps in knowledge. Six electronic databases were searched for published papers (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, SciELO, and CENTRAL). Results: After the eligibility assessment, we identified 22 Internet-based studies carried out in Latin America for prevention, treatment, education, or facilitating self-management of mental disorders. Included studies mainly targeted depression (n = 11), substance misuse (n = 6), anxiety (n = 3), and mental health literacy for education and health professionals (n = 2). Most studies were undertaken in Brazil (n = 6), Mexico (n = 5), and Chile (n = 4). Only 3 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 were pilot RCTs, and 15 were naturalistic, acceptability, or feasibility studies. The three RCTs identified showed disparate results, but overall, there are challenges to face. Better results are seen in the short-term (postintervention or after 3 months), but most studies do not explore outcomes for long enough (follow-up after 6 or 12 months). Most of the feasibility and pilot studies showed reasonably good acceptability for a wide range of strategies but difficulties to engage and retain participants for long enough or adhering to established protocols. Conclusion: This study shows that Internet-based interventions for the prevention and treatment of mental disorders are growing rapidly in Latin America, but there are few studies on effectiveness and cost effectiveness, making it difficult to provide the evidence needed to justify scaling up these interventions."

Recent policy advising schools on managing behavior has promoted the early identification of behavioral difficulties. There is also increasing research into mHealth interventions to provide support for emotional and behavioral difficulties for young people. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of the proposed research is to examine the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention, ReZone, in reducing emotional and behavioral difficulties in young people. METHODS: The protocol is a cluster trial of 12 classes with N=120 students with classes randomized to ReZone or management as usual. Multilevel modeling will be used to compare ReZone versus management as usual accounting for classroom-level variation. RESULTS: Baseline data collection started in February 2017 and ended in April 2017. Follow-up data collection started in April 2017 and ended in June 2017. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed research will provide evidence as to whether ReZone is effective at helping young people to self-manage when feeling overwhelmed.

"A Web-Based Service Delivery Model for Communication Training After Brain Injury: Protocol for a Mixed Methods, Prospective, Hybrid Type 2 Implementation-Effectiveness Study","Miao M, Power E, Rietdijk R, Brunner M, Debono D, Togher L.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Dec 9;10(12):e31995. doi: 10.2196/31995.,Miao M,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/12/10,PMC8704121,,10.2196/31995,"BACKGROUND: Acquired brain injuries (ABIs) commonly cause cognitive-communication disorders, which can have a pervasive psychosocial impact on a person's life. More than 135 million people worldwide currently live with ABI, and this large and growing burden is increasingly surpassing global rehabilitation service capacity. A web-based service delivery model may offer a scalable solution. The Social Brain Toolkit is an evidence-based suite of 3 web-based communication training interventions for people with ABI and their communication partners. Successful real-world delivery of web-based interventions such as the Social Brain Toolkit requires investigation of intervention implementation in addition to efficacy and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of the Social Brain Toolkit as a web-based service delivery model. METHODS: This is a mixed methods, prospective, hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness study, theoretically underpinned by the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework of digital health implementation. We will document implementation strategies preemptively deployed to support the launch of the Social Brain Toolkit interventions, as well as implementation strategies identified by end users through formative evaluation of the Social Brain Toolkit. We will prospectively observe implementation outcomes, selected on the basis of the NASSS framework, through quantitative web analytics of intervention use, qualitative and quantitative pre- and postintervention survey data from all users within a specified sample frame, and qualitative interviews with a subset of users of each intervention. Qualitative implementation data will be deductively analyzed against the NASSS framework. Quantitative implementation data will be analyzed descriptively. We will obtain effectiveness outcomes through web-based knowledge tests, custom user questionnaires, and formal clinical tools. Quantitative effectiveness outcomes will be analyzed through descriptive statistics and the Reliable Change Index, with repeated analysis of variance (pretraining, posttraining, and follow-up), to determine whether there is any significant improvement within this participant sample. RESULTS: Data collection commenced on July 2, 2021, and is expected to conclude on June 1, 2022, after a 6-month sample frame of analytics for each Social Brain Toolkit intervention. Data analysis will occur concurrently with data collection until mid-2022, with results expected for publication late 2022 and early 2023. CONCLUSIONS: End-user evaluation of the Social Brain Toolkit's implementation can guide intervention development and implementation to reach and meet community needs in a feasible, scalable, sustainable, and acceptable manner. End user feedback will be directly incorporated and addressed wherever possible in the next version of the Social Brain Toolkit. Learnings from these findings will benefit the implementation of this and future web-based psychosocial interventions for people with ABI and other populations.

An online behavior change intervention to promote physical activity in adults with asthma: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial,"de Oliveira JM, Karloh M, Matias TS, Barbosa GB, Freitas PD, Carvalho CRF, Furlanetto KC.",Trials. 2022 Dec 7;23(1):983. doi: 10.1186/s13063-022-06881-x.,de Oliveira JM,Trials,2022,2022/12/08,PMC9727857,,10.1186/s13063-022-06881-x,"BACKGROUND: Behavior change interventions have been the focus of recent studies, and the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of online interventions. However, no previous studies have investigated behavior change techniques to improve physical activity in adults with asthma through online intervention. METHODS: This double-blind clinical trial will investigate the effectiveness of an online behavior change intervention in increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in adults with asthma, as well as in improving other clinical outcomes in short and medium terms. Patients with clinically stable moderate to severe asthma, who are physically inactive and do not have cardiovascular and/or osteoneuromuscular impairments will be randomized into control or intervention groups (23 in each). Both groups will carry out an online educational program (1 h). Additionally, the intervention group will receive weekly individual online sessions for 12 weeks of motivation-based behavior change intervention to promote an increase in physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior based on both self-determination theory and transtheoretical model. The intervention group will also receive an activity monitor with specific strategies related to it. Both groups will be reassessed immediately after the intervention and 6 months after that. The primary outcomes are physical activity and sedentary behavior, which will be objectively assessed by a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X-BT). Secondary outcomes are Asthma Control Questionnaire, Incremental Step Test, Sit-To-Stand, Timed Up-and-Go, 4-Metre Gait Speed, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Actiwatch 2, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. DISCUSSION: The intervention is unprecedented and was carefully developed to joint most characteristics and techniques of both behavioral strategies (transtheoretical model and self-determination theory). Therefore, this intervention has the potential to improve physical activity levels and asthma management and reduce sedentary behavior. As a consequence, this novel intervention will improve global health in this population and support its use in clinical practice. The intervention will be carried out online with direct weekly contact with the therapist. Consequently, it has low implementation costs, might improve patient's attendance, and has the potential to be largely offered elsewhere. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05241223 .

The Effectiveness of mHealth Interventions Targeting Parents and Youth in Human Papillomavirus Vaccination: Systematic Review,"Ou L, Chen AC, Amresh A.",JMIR Pediatr Parent. 2023 Nov 21;6:e47334. doi: 10.2196/47334.,Ou L,JMIR Pediatr Parent,2023,2023/11/21,PMC10698656,,10.2196/47334,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and its related cancers is a major global concern. In the United States, routine HPV vaccination is recommended for youth aged 11 or 12 years. Despite HPV being the most common sexually transmitted infection and the vaccine's proven efficacy, the vaccination rate among US youth remains below the recommended 80% completion rate. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have demonstrated promise in improving health. Examining and synthesizing the current evidence about the impact of mHealth interventions on vaccination coverage in youth and intervention characteristics could guide future mHealth interventions aimed at mitigating the vaccination gap and disease burden. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on parental intent to vaccinate youth against HPV and youth's vaccine uptake. METHODS: We searched empirical papers through databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. The inclusion criteria were the following: (1) published between January 2011 and December 2022; (2) using mHealth aimed to improve HPV vaccination rate; (3) targeted unvaccinated youth or their parents; and (4) measured HPV-related knowledge, vaccination intention, or vaccine uptake. Overall, 3 researchers screened and appraised the quality of the eligible papers using the Melnyk Levels of Evidence and the Cochrane Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Disagreements in search results and result interpretation were resolved through consensus. RESULTS: Overall, 17 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the final review. Most studies were conducted in the United States (14/17, 82%), used a randomized controlled trial design (12/17, 71%), and adopted behavior change theories or a culture-centric approach (10/17, 59%). mHealth interventions included SMS text message reminders, motivational SMS text messages, computer-tailored or tablet-tailored interventions, smartphone apps, web-based tailored interventions, social media (Facebook) campaigns, digital videos, and digital storytelling interventions. Approximately 88% (15/17) of the mHealth interventions demonstrated positive effects on knowledge, intention, or behaviors related to HPV vaccination. Overall, 12% (2/17) reported limited or no intervention impact on vaccine uptake or vaccine series completion. Effective vaccine uptake was commonly seen in interventions based on behavior change theories and those that provided culturally relevant information. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified the impact of mHealth interventions among unvaccinated youth and their parents, which showed improvement in HPV-related knowledge, vaccination intention, or vaccine initiation. The interventions that incorporated theories and culture-centric approaches revealed the most promising results. Although these outcomes are encouraging, future studies are needed to investigate factors associated with the success of interventions using SMS text messaging or social media. More studies are also needed for a better understanding of the intervention elements that boost the responses of age-specific and ethnicity-specific populations."
Digital health interventions for the management of mental health in people with chronic diseases: a rapid review,"Sasseville M, LeBlanc A, Boucher M, Dugas M, Mbemba G, Tchuente J, Chouinard MC, Beaulieu M, Beaudet N, Skidmore B, Cholette P, Aspiros C, Larouche A, Chabot G, Gagnon MP.",BMJ Open. 2021 Apr 5;11(4):e044437. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044437.,Sasseville M,BMJ Open,2021,2021/04/06,PMC8030477,,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044437,"OBJECTIVE: Determine the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for individuals with a concomitant chronic disease. DESIGN: We conducted a rapid review of systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and risk of bias evaluation. A standardised extraction form was used. Data are reported narratively. INTERVENTIONS: We included systematic reviews of digital health interventions aiming to prevent, detect or manage mental health problems in individuals with a pre-existing chronic disease, including chronic mental health illnesses, published in 2010 or after. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reports on mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms). RESULTS: We included 35 reviews, totalling 702 primary studies with a total sample of 50 692 participants. We structured the results in four population clusters: (1) chronic diseases, (2) cancer, (3) mental health and (4) children and youth. For populations presenting a chronic disease or cancer, health provider directed digital interventions (eg, web-based consultation, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy) are effective and safe. Further analyses are required in order to provide stronger recommendations regarding relevance for specific population (such as children and youth). Web-based interventions and email were the modes of administration that had the most reports of improvement. Virtual reality, smartphone applications and patient portal had limited reports of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Digital technologies could be used to prevent and manage mental health problems in people living with chronic conditions, with consideration for the age group and type of technology used."
HIV self-testing with digital supports as the new paradigm: A systematic review of global evidence (2010-2021),"McGuire M, de Waal A, Karellis A, Janssen R, Engel N, Sampath R, Carmona S, Zwerling AA, Suarez MF, Pai NP.",EClinicalMedicine. 2021 Aug 13;39:101059. doi: 10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101059. eCollection 2021 Sep.,McGuire M,EClinicalMedicine,2021,2021/08/25,PMC8367787,,10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101059,"BACKGROUND: HIV self-testing (HIVST) is recommended by the WHO as an innovative strategy to reach UNAIDS targets to end HIV by 2030. HIVST with digital supports is defined as the use of digital interventions (e.g., website-based, social media, mobile HIVST applications (apps), text messaging (SMS), digital vending machines (digital VMs)) to improve the efficiency and impact of HIVST. HIVST deployment and integration in health services is an emerging priority. We conducted a systematic review aiming to close the gap in evidence that summarizes the impact of digitally supported HIVST and to inform policy recommendations. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Embase for articles and abstracts on HIVST with digital supports published during the period February 1st, 2010 to June 15th, 2021, following Cochrane guidelines and PRISMA methodology. We assessed feasibility, acceptability, preference, and impact outcomes across all populations and study designs. Metrics reported were willingness to use HIVST, preferences for HIVST delivery, proportion of first-time testers, HIVST uptake, HIVST kit return rate, and linkage to care. Heterogeneity of the interventions and reported metrics precluded us from conducting a meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 46 studies were narratively synthesized, of which 72% were observational and 28% were RCTs. Half of all studies (54%, 25/46) assessed web-based innovations (e.g., study websites, videos, chatbots), followed by social media (26%, 12/46), HIVST-specific apps (7%, 3/46), SMS (9%, 4/46), and digital VMs (4%, 2/46). Web-based innovations were found to be acceptable (77-97%), preferred over in-person and hybrid options by more first-time testers (47-48%), highly feasible (93-95%), and were overall effective in supporting linkage to care (53-100%). Social media and app-based innovations also had high acceptability (87-95%) and linkage to care proportions (80-100%). SMS innovations increased kit return rates (54-94%) and HIVST uptake among hard-to-reach groups. Finally, digital VMs were highly acceptable (54-93%), and HIVST uptake was six times greater when using digital VMs compared to distribution by community workers. INTERPRETATION: HIVST with digital supports was deemed feasible, acceptable, preferable, and was shown to increase uptake, engage first-time testers and hard-to-reach populations, and successfully link participants to treatment. Findings pave the way for greater use of HIVST interventions with digital supports globally."
A Systematic Review of the Scope of Study of mHealth Interventions for Wellness and Related Challenges in Pediatric and Young Adult Populations,"Bond SJ, Parikh N, Majmudar S, Pin S, Wang C, Willis L, Haga SB.",Adolesc Health Med Ther. 2022 Feb 7;13:23-38. doi: 10.2147/AHMT.S342811. eCollection 2022.,Bond SJ,Adolesc Health Med Ther,2022,2022/02/17,PMC8835977,,10.2147/AHMT.S342811,"BACKGROUND: Despite the purported advantages and potential efficacy of mHealth interventions to promote wellness in children, adolescents, and young adults, it is not clear what areas have been explored and the challenges reported in the biomedical literature. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of publications between 2015 and 2019. RESULTS: We identified 54 papers that met our inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in 21 countries and ranged in size from six to 9851 participants (median: 184). A total of 41% of studies enrolled adolescents only (n = 19). Of the seven types of mHealth interventions identified, apps were the most common intervention (59%; n = 32) evaluated and 44% of the studies evaluated two or more interventions. The most common topic of the studies reviewed was sexual and reproductive health (24%; n = 13). CONCLUSION: Most pediatric mHealth intervention studies are conducted in adolescents in large part, and sexual and reproductive health is the most commonly studied topic. With the easy and widespread accessibility to smartphone technology, the use of mobile apps for wellness interventions will likely continue to expand to other wellness topics."
Self-directed interventions to promote weight loss: a systematic review of reviews,"Tang J, Abraham C, Greaves C, Yates T.",J Med Internet Res. 2014 Feb 19;16(2):e58. doi: 10.2196/jmir.2857.,Tang J,J Med Internet Res,2014,2014/02/21,PMC3961624,,10.2196/jmir.2857,"BACKGROUND: A wide range of self-directed weight-loss interventions are available, providing users with a variety of tools delivered through various formats to regulate weight-related behavior patterns. However, it is unclear how effective self-directed interventions are and how they promote weight loss and weight maintenance. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of reviews was conducted to examine the effectiveness of such interventions and to identify intervention content associated with effectiveness. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews were searched from 2000-2012 for reviews of the effectiveness of self-directed interventions on weight loss and weight maintenance in adults. Two reviewers used predefined inclusion criteria to select relevant reviews and assess their quality using the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ). We extracted data on effectiveness and on relationships between intervention characteristics and effectiveness. RESULTS: Twenty reviews were included and quality assessed. Findings relevant to self-directed interventions, including interactive websites, smartphone applications, and text messaging (short message service, SMS) were summarized. Findings were mixed but promising. For example, one review of Internet-based interventions found that, when used in conjunction with standard weight loss programs, these interventions resulted in a significant average increase in weight loss of 1.5 kg over evaluation periods. Unfortunately, only 7 of 20 reviews were of high methodological quality according to OQAQ scores, and only 4 employed meta-analyses. Few reviews linked intervention content to effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that self-directed interventions can independently promote weight loss and can augment interventions involving personal contact. Particular change techniques and delivery modes including individualized feedback, email counseling, and online social support appear to enhance effectiveness. Further reviews of the content of self-directed weight-loss intervention studies are needed to clarify which change techniques delivered through which delivery formats optimize intervention effectiveness."
"Beyond the Trial: Systematic Review of Real-World Uptake and Engagement With Digital Self-Help Interventions for Depression, Low Mood, or Anxiety","Fleming T, Bavin L, Lucassen M, Stasiak K, Hopkins S, Merry S.",J Med Internet Res. 2018 Jun 6;20(6):e199. doi: 10.2196/jmir.9275.,Fleming T,J Med Internet Res,2018,2018/06/08,PMC6010835,,10.2196/jmir.9275,"BACKGROUND: Digital self-help interventions (including online or computerized programs and apps) for common mental health issues have been shown to be appealing, engaging, and efficacious in randomized controlled trials. They show potential for improving access to therapy and improving population mental health. However, their use in the real world, ie, as implemented (disseminated) outside of research settings, may differ from that reported in trials, and implementation data are seldom reported. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review peer-reviewed articles reporting user uptake and/or ongoing use, retention, or completion data (hereafter usage data or, for brevity, engagement) from implemented pure self-help (unguided) digital interventions for depression, anxiety, or the enhancement of mood. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the Scopus, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases for studies reporting user uptake and/or usage data from implemented digital self-help interventions for the treatment or prevention of depression or anxiety, or the enhancement of mood, from 2002 to 2017. Additionally, we screened the reference lists of included articles, citations of these articles, and the titles of articles published in Internet Interventions, Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR), and JMIR Mental Health since their inception. We extracted data indicating the number of registrations or downloads and usage of interventions. RESULTS: After the removal of duplicates, 970 papers were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria. Hand searching identified 1 additional article. The included articles reported on 7 publicly available interventions. There was little consistency in the measures reported. The number of registrants or downloads ranged widely, from 8 to over 40,000 per month. From 21% to 88% of users engaged in at least minimal use (eg, used the intervention at least once or completed one module or assessment), whereas 7-42% engaged in moderate use (completing between 40% and 60% of modular fixed-length programs or continuing to use apps after 4 weeks). Indications of completion or sustained use (completion of all modules or the last assessment or continuing to use apps after six weeks or more) varied from 0.5% to 28.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Available data suggest that uptake and engagement vary widely among the handful of implemented digital self-help apps and programs that have reported this, and that usage may vary from that reported in trials. Implementation data should be routinely gathered and reported to facilitate improved uptake and engagement, arguably among the major challenges in digital health."
Digital Health Platforms for Breast Cancer Care: A Scoping Review,"Kirsch EP, Kunte SA, Wu KA, Kaplan S, Hwang ES, Plichta JK, Lad SP.",J Clin Med. 2024 Mar 27;13(7):1937. doi: 10.3390/jcm13071937.,Kirsch EP,J Clin Med,2024,2024/04/13,PMC11012307,,10.3390/jcm13071937,"Breast cancer is a significant global health concern affecting millions of women each year. Digital health platforms are an easily accessible intervention that can improve patient care, though their efficacy in breast cancer care is unknown. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of existing research on the utilization of digital health platforms for breast cancer care and identify key trends and gaps in the literature. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across electronic databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, Elsevier EMBASE, and Elsevier Scopus databases. The search strategy incorporated keywords related to ""digital health platforms"", ""breast cancer care"", and associated terminologies. After screening for eligibility, a total of 25 articles were included in this scoping review. The identified studies comprised mobile applications and web-based interventions. These platforms demonstrated various functionalities, including patient education, symptom monitoring, treatment adherence, and psychosocial support. The findings indicate the potential of digital health platforms in improving breast cancer care and patients' overall experiences. The positive impact on patient outcomes, including improved quality of life and reduced psychological distress, underscores the importance of incorporating digital health solutions into breast cancer management. Additional research is necessary to validate the effectiveness of these platforms in diverse patient populations and assess their impact on healthcare-resource utilization."

mHealth Phone Intervention to Reduce Maternal Deaths and Morbidity in Cameroon: Protocol for Translational Adaptation,"Budhwani H, Enah C, Bond CL, Halle-Ekane G, Wallace E, Turan JM, Szychowski JM, Long DM, Carlo WA, Tih PM, Tita ATN.",Int J Womens Health. 2022 May 7;14:677-686. doi: 10.2147/IJWH.S353919. eCollection 2022.,Budhwani H,Int J Womens Health,2022,2022/05/16,PMC9093609,,10.2147/IJWH.S353919,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this NIH-funded protocol is to adapt (Aim 1) and pilot test (Aim 2) an mHealth intervention to improve maternal and child health in Cameroon. We will adapt the 24/7 University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Information Service via Telephone (MIST) provider support system to mMIST (mobile MIST) for peripheral providers who provide healthcare to pregnant and postpartum women and newborns in Cameroon. METHODS: In Aim 1, we apply qualitative and participatory methods (in-depth interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders) to inform the adaptation of mMIST for use in Cameroon. We use the sequential phases of the ADAPT-ITT framework to iteratively adapt mMIST incorporating qualitative findings and tailoring for local contexts. In Aim 2, we test the adapted intervention for feasibility and acceptability in Ndop, Cameroon. RESULTS: This study is ongoing at the time that this protocol is published. CONCLUSION: The adaptation, refinement, and pilot testing of mMIST will be used to inform a larger-scale stepped wedged cluster randomized controlled effectiveness trial. If successful, this mHealth intervention could be a powerful tool enabling providers in low-resource settings to deliver improved pregnancy care, thereby reducing maternal and fetal deaths."
Mobile Phone-Based Interventions for Smoking Cessation Among Young People: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Zhou X, Wei X, Cheng A, Liu Z, Su Z, Li J, Qin R, Zhao L, Xie Y, Huang Z, Xia X, Liu Y, Song Q, Xiao D, Wang C.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2023 Sep 12;11:e48253. doi: 10.2196/48253.,Zhou X,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2023,2023/09/14,PMC10510452,,10.2196/48253,"BACKGROUND: Mobile phone-based cessation interventions have emerged as a promising alternative for smoking cessation, while evidence of the efficacy of mobile phone-based smoking cessation programs among young people is mixed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of mobile phone-based interventions compared to usual practice or assessment-only controls on smoking cessation in young people. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science on March 8, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of mobile phone-based interventions on smoking cessation in young people (age </=30 years). The risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane Risk of Bias 2. RESULTS: A total of 13 eligible studies, comprising 27,240 participants, were included in this analysis. The age range of the participants was between 16 and 30 years. Nine studies were SMS text messaging interventions, and 4 studies were app-based interventions. The duration of the smoking cessation intervention varied from 5 days to 6 months. The included studies were conducted in the following countries: the United States, China, Sweden, Canada, Switzerland, and Thailand. The meta-analysis revealed that SMS text messaging interventions significantly improved continuous abstinence rates compared to inactive control conditions (risk ratio [RR] 1.51, 95% CI 1.24-1.84). The subgroup analysis showed pooled RRs of 1.90 (95% CI 1.29-2.81), 1.64 (95% CI 1.23-2.18), and 1.35 (95% CI 1.04-1.76) for continuous abstinence at the 1-, 3-, and 6- month follow-up, respectively. Pooling across 7 studies, SMS text messaging interventions showed efficacy in promoting 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA), with an RR of 1.83 (95% CI 1.34-2.48). The subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant impact at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups, with pooled RRs of 1.72 (95% CI 1.13-2.63) and 2.54 (95% CI 2.05-3.14), respectively, compared to inactive control conditions. However, at the 6-month follow-up, the efficacy of SMS text messaging interventions in promoting 7-day PPA was not statistically significant (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.92-2.28). In contrast, app-based interventions did not show significant efficacy in promoting continuous abstinence or 7-day PPA. However, it is important to note that the evidence for app-based interventions was limited. CONCLUSIONS: SMS text messaging-based smoking cessation interventions compared to inactive controls were associated with abstinence among young people and could be considered a viable option for smoking cessation in this population. More research is needed on smoking cessation apps, especially apps that target young people. Future research should focus on identifying the most effective mobile phone-based cessation approaches and on developing strategies to increase their uptake and intention."
mHealth-Based Gamification Interventions Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in the HIV Prevention and Care Continuum: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Luo Q, Zhang Y, Wang W, Cui T, Li T.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2024 Apr 15;12:e49509. doi: 10.2196/49509.,Luo Q,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2024,2024/04/16,PMC11034423,,10.2196/49509,"BACKGROUND: In the past few years, a burgeoning interest has emerged in applying gamification to promote desired health behaviors. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such applications in the HIV prevention and care continuum among men who have sex with men (MSM). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize and evaluate research on the effectiveness of gamification on the HIV prevention and care continuum, including HIV-testing promotion; condomless anal sex (CAS) reduction; and uptake of and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Journal of Medical Internet Research and its sister journals for studies published in English and Chinese from inception to January 2024. Eligible studies were included when they used gamified interventions with an active or inactive control group and assessed at least one of the following outcomes: HIV testing; CAS; and uptake of and adherence to PrEP, PEP, and ART. During the meta-analysis, a random-effects model was applied. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality and risk of bias of each included study. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 26 studies, including 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The results indicated that gamified digital interventions had been applied to various HIV outcomes, such as HIV testing, CAS, PrEP uptake and adherence, PEP uptake, and ART adherence. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States (n=19, 73%). The most frequently used game component was gaining points, followed by challenges. The meta-analysis showed gamification interventions could reduce the number of CAS acts at the 3-month follow-up (n=2 RCTs; incidence rate ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.88). The meta-analysis also suggested an effective but nonstatistically significant effect of PrEP adherence at the 3-month follow-up (n=3 RCTs; risk ratio 1.16, 95% CI 0.96-1.38) and 6-month follow-up (n=4 RCTs; risk ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.89-1.84). Only 1 pilot RCT was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a gamified app in promoting HIV testing and PrEP uptake. No RCT was conducted to evaluate the effect of the gamified digital intervention on PEP uptake and adherence, and ART initiation among MSM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the short-term effect of gamified digital interventions on lowering the number of CAS acts in MSM. Further well-powered studies are still needed to evaluate the effect of the gamified digital intervention on HIV testing, PrEP uptake, PEP initiation and adherence, and ART initiation in MSM."
Impact of Digital Educational Interventions to Support Parents Caring for Acutely Ill Children at Home and Factors That Affect Their Use: Protocol for a Systematic Review,"Milne-Ives M, Neill S, Bayes N, Blair M, Blewitt J, Bray L, Carrol ED, Carter B, Dawson R, Dimitri P, Lakhanpaul M, Roland D, Tavare A, Meinert E; ASK SNIFF Consortium.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Jun 30;10(6):e27504. doi: 10.2196/27504.,Milne-Ives M,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/07/06,PMC8280832,,10.2196/27504,"BACKGROUND: Urgent and emergency care health services are overburdened, and the use of these services by acutely ill infants and children is increasing. A large proportion of these visits could be sufficiently addressed by other health care professionals. Uncertainty about the severity of a child's symptoms is one of many factors that play a role in parents' decisions to take their children to emergency services, demonstrating the need for improved support for health literacy. Digital interventions are a potential tool to improve parents' knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy at managing acute childhood illness. However, existing systematic reviews related to this topic need to be updated and expanded to provide a contemporary review of the impact, usability, and limitations of these solutions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review protocol is to present the method for an evaluation of the impact, usability, and limitations of different types of digital educational interventions to support parents caring for acutely ill children at home. METHODS: The review will be structured using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) and Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) frameworks. Five databases will be systematically searched for studies published in English during and after 2014: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, APA PsycNet, and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently screen references' titles and abstracts, select studies for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria, and extract the data into a standardized form. Any disagreements will be discussed and resolved by a third reviewer if necessary. Risk of bias of all studies will be assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and a descriptive analysis will be used to evaluate the outcomes reported. RESULTS: The systematic review will commence during 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will summarize the impact, usability, and limitations of digital interventions for parents with acutely ill children. It will provide an overview of the field; identify reported impacts on health and behavioral outcomes as well as parental knowledge, satisfaction, and decision making; and identify the factors that affect use to help inform the development of more effective and sustainable interventions.

Digital interventions for opioid use disorder treatment: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"Kiburi SK, Ngarachu E, Tomita A, Paruk S, Chiliza B.",J Subst Abuse Treat. 2023 Jan;144:108926. doi: 10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108926. Epub 2022 Oct 31.,Kiburi SK,J Subst Abuse Treat,2023,2022/11/10,,,10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108926,"INTRODUCTION: Opioid use disorders are associated with a high burden of disease and treatment gap. Digital interventions can be used to provide psycho-social treatment for opioid use disorders, as an alternative to or together with face-to-face interventions. This review aimed to assess the application and effectiveness of digital interventions to treat opioid use disorder globally. METHODS: The study team searched four electronic databases (PubMed, Psych INFO, Web of Science and Cochrane Central register of controlled trials). The inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trials, assessment for opioid use before and at least once following intervention, and use of digital interventions. The primary outcomes were opioid use and/or retention in treatment, with data being summarized in tables and a narrative review presented. RESULTS: The initial database search yielded 3542 articles, of which this review includes 20. Nineteen were conducted among adults in the United States. The digital interventions used included web-based, computer-based, telephone calls, video conferencing, automated self-management system, mobile applications and text messaging. They were based on therapeutic education systems, community reinforcement approaches, cognitive behavior therapy, relapse prevention, brief interventions, supportive counselling and motivational interviewing. The studies had mixed findings; of the 20 studies, 10 had statistically significant differences between the treatment groups for opioid abstinence, and four had significant differences for treatment retention. Comparisons were difficult due to varying methodologies. Participants rated the interventions as acceptable and reported high rates of satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The use of digital interventions for opioid use disorder treatment was acceptable, with varying levels of effectiveness for improving outcomes, which is influenced by participant and intervention delivery factors. Further studies in different parts of the world should compare these findings, specifically in low- and middle-income countries."
Engagement with mobile health interventions for depression: A systematic review,"Molloy A, Anderson PL.",Internet Interv. 2021 Sep 11;26:100454. doi: 10.1016/j.invent.2021.100454. eCollection 2021 Dec.,Molloy A,Internet Interv,2021,2021/10/08,PMC8479400,,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100454,"BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are a major public health problem, and many people face barriers to accessing evidence-based mental health treatment. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may circumvent logistical barriers to in-person care (e.g., cost, transportation), however the symptoms of depression (low motivation, concentration difficulties) may make it difficult for people with the disorder to engage with mHealth. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to examine assessment and reporting of engagement in clinical trials of mHealth interventions for depression, including objective engagement (e.g., number of times program is used), subjective engagement (e.g., qualitative data on users' experiences), and associations between engagement and other clinically important variables (e.g., symptom improvement, participant characteristics). METHODS: Three electronic databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed) were searched in February 2020 using search terms for mHealth and depression. Studies were included in the review if they tested a mHealth intervention designed for people with depressive disorders or elevated depression symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Most studies reported objective engagement (N = 23, 76.7%), approximately half reported subjective engagement (N = 16, 53.3%), and relatively few examined associations between engagement and clinical improvement, participant characteristics, or other clinically relevant variables (N = 13, 43.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Although most studies in this small but rapidly growing literature report at least one measure of engagement, there is substantial heterogeneity. Intentional, theory-driven, and consistent measurement of engagement with mHealth interventions for depression may advance the field's understanding of effective engagement to facilitate clinical improvement, identify dose-response relationships, and maximize generalizability for underserved populations."
"Evaluation of the Implementation and Effectiveness of a Mobile Health Intervention to Improve Outcomes for People With HIV in the Washington, DC Cohort: Study Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial","Hodges J, Caldwell S, Cohn W, Flickinger T, Waldman AL, Dillingham R, Castel A, Ingersoll K.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Apr 22;11(4):e37748. doi: 10.2196/37748.,Hodges J,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/03/29,PMC9077495,,10.2196/37748,"BACKGROUND: Gaps remain in achieving retention in care and durable HIV viral load suppression for people with HIV in Washington, DC (hereafter DC). Although people with HIV seeking care in DC have access to a range of supportive services, innovative strategies are needed to enhance patient engagement in this setting. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have shown promise in reaching previously underengaged groups and improving HIV-related outcomes in various settings. OBJECTIVE: This study will evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a clinic-deployed, multifeature mHealth intervention called PositiveLinks (PL) among people with HIV enrolled in the DC Cohort, a longitudinal cohort of people with HIV receiving care in DC. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design and will compare HIV-related outcomes between clinics randomized to PL versus usual care. METHODS: The study aims are threefold: (1) We will perform a formative evaluation of PL in the context of DC Cohort clinics to test the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of PL and tailor the platform for use in this context. (2) We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial with 12 DC Cohort clinics randomized to PL or usual care (n=6 [50%] per arm) and measure the effectiveness of PL by the primary outcomes of patient visit constancy, retention in care, and HIV viral load suppression. We aim to enroll a total of 482 participants from DC Cohort clinic sites, specifically including people with HIV who show evidence of inconsistent retention in care or lack of viral suppression. (3) We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to measure implementation success and identify site, patient, provider, and system factors associated with successful implementation. Evaluation activities will occur pre-, mid-, and postimplementation. RESULTS: Formative data collection was completed between April 2021 and January 2022. Preliminary mHealth platform modifications have been performed, and the first round of user testing has been completed. A preimplementation evaluation was performed to identify relevant implementation outcomes and design a suite of instruments to guide data collection for evaluation of PL implementation throughout the trial period. Instruments include those already developed to support DC Cohort Study activities and PL implementation in other cohorts, which required modification for use in the study, as well as novel instruments designed to complete data collection, as guided by the CFIR and RE-AIM frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Formative and preimplementation evaluations will be completed in spring 2022 when the trial is planned to launch. Specifically, comprehensive formative data analysis will be completed following data collection, coding, preliminary review, and synthesis. Corresponding platform modifications are ready for beta testing within the DC Cohort. Finalization of the platform for use in the trial will follow beta testing.

A Web-Based Intervention to Reduce Decision Conflict Regarding HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis: Protocol for a Clinical Trial,"Nelson LE, Ajiboye W, Djiadeu P, Odhiambo AJ, Pedersen C, Ramos SR, Lofters A, Mbuagbaw L, Williams G.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Jun 15;9(6):e15080. doi: 10.2196/15080.,Nelson LE,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/04/30,PMC7324994,,10.2196/15080,"BACKGROUND: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for populations at high ongoing risk for infection. There are noted racial disparities in the incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for African, Caribbean, and Canadian Black (ACB, black) populations in Ontario, Canada. Although blacks represent only 4.7% of the Ontario population, they account for 30% of HIV prevalence and 25% of new infections in the province. The existing clinical public health practice toolkit has not been sufficient to optimize PrEP uptake, despite the overwhelming evidence of PrEP's efficacy for reducing HIV transmission risk. Since its establishment as an effective HIV prevention tool, the major focus in behavioral research on PrEP has been on understanding and improving adherence. To date, there is no known formalized intervention in place designed to support ACB men and women at high risk of making high-quality decisions regarding the adoption of PrEP as an HIV prevention practice. OBJECTIVE: We propose 2 aims to address these gaps in HIV prevention and implementation science. First, the Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF) for use in the PrEP decisional needs of black patients was adapted. Second, the decision support intervention to estimate effect size compared with control conditions in reducing decision conflict and predicting adherence over 60 days was pilot tested. METHODS: In aim 1, we propose a cross-sectional qualitative descriptive study using data collected from key informant interviews with eligible PrEP patients (n=30) and surveys with health professionals (n=20) involved in HIV PrEP management. Data obtained from aim 1 will be used to develop a decision support intervention based on the ODSF. In aim 2, the adopted decision support intervention using a block-randomized design to estimate effect size compared with control conditions in reducing decision conflict and predicting adherence over 60 days was pilot tested. Hypothesis testing will be de-emphasized in favor of generating effect size estimates. RESULTS: A research award was funded on March 25, 2017 (Multimedia Appendix 1). Ethical approval was received on March 25, 2019 (with supplemental approval received on May 10, 2019). Data collection started on April 9, 2019. As of September 30, 2019, we enrolled 29 patients and 24 health care providers for aim 1. We are currently analysing the data collected for aim 1. Aim 2 is scheduled to start in May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide evidence-based information on the decisional needs of black patients who are at risk of HIV and have been offered PrEP. The study will also test the effect of decision support intervention in reducing decision conflict, adoption of PrEP, and adherence to PrEP.

mHealth Interventions to Support Caregivers of Older Adults: Equity-Focused Systematic Review,"Garnett A, Northwood M, Ting J, Sangrar R.",JMIR Aging. 2022 Jul 8;5(3):e33085. doi: 10.2196/33085.,Garnett A,JMIR Aging,2022,2022/05/26,PMC9308083,,10.2196/33085,"BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers, hereafter referred to as caregivers, provide support to older adults so that they can age safely at home. The decision to become a caregiver can be influenced by individual factors, such as personal choice, or societal factors such as social determinants of health, including household income, employment status, and culture-specific gender roles. Over time, caregivers' health can be negatively affected by their caregiving roles. Although programs exist to support caregivers, the availability and appropriateness of services do not match caregivers' expressed needs. Research suggests that supportive interventions offered through mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to increase caregivers' access to supportive services. However, a knowledge gap remains regarding the extent to which social determinants of health are considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of mHealth interventions intended to support the caregivers of older adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to determine how health equity is considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of mHealth interventions for caregivers of older adults using Cochrane Equity's PROGRESS-Plus (place of residence, race, ethnicity, culture, language, occupation, gender, religion, education, social capital, socioeconomic status-plus age, disability, and sexual orientation) framework and synthesize evidence of the impacts of the identified caregiver-focused mHealth interventions. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using 5 databases. Articles published between January 2010 and June 2021 were included if they evaluated or explored the impact of mHealth interventions on the health and well-being of informal caregivers of older adults. mHealth interventions were defined as supportive services, for example, education, that caregivers of older adults accessed via mobile or wireless devices. RESULTS: In total, 28 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The interventions evaluated sought to connect caregivers with services, facilitate caregiving, and promote caregivers' health and well-being. The PROGRESS-Plus framework factors were mainly considered in the results, discussion, and limitations sections of the included studies. Some PROGRESS-Plus factors such as sexual orientation, religion, and occupation, received little to no consideration across any phase of the intervention design, implementation, or evaluation. Overall, the findings of this review suggest that mHealth interventions were positively received by study participants. Such interventions have the potential to reduce caregiver burden and positively affect caregivers' physical and mental health while supporting them as caregivers. The study findings highlight the importance of making support available to help facilitate caregivers' use of mHealth interventions, as well as in the use of appropriate language and text. CONCLUSIONS: The successful uptake and spread of mHealth interventions to support caregivers of older adults will depend on creating opportunities for the inclusive involvement of a broad range of stakeholders at all stages of design, implementation, and evaluation."
Scaled-Up Mobile Phone Intervention for HIV Care and Treatment: Protocol for a Facility Randomized Controlled Trial,"L'Engle KL, Green K, Succop SM, Laar A, Wambugu S.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2015 Jan 23;4(1):e11. doi: 10.2196/resprot.3659.,L'Engle KL,JMIR Res Protoc,2015,2015/02/05,PMC4319075,,10.2196/resprot.3659,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to prevention, care, and treatment recommendations among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is a critical challenge. Yet good clinical outcomes depend on consistent, high adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens. Mobile phones offer a promising means to improve patient adherence and health outcomes. However, limited information exists on the impact that mobile phones for health (mHealth) programs have on ART adherence or the behavior change processes through which such interventions may improve patient health, particularly among ongoing clients enrolled in large public sector HIV service delivery programs and key populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSW). OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to evaluate an mHealth intervention where text message reminders are used as supportive tools for health providers and as motivators and reminders for ART clients to adhere to treatment and remain linked to care in Ghana. Using an implementation science framework, we seek to: (1) evaluate mHealth intervention effects on patient adherence and health outcomes, (2) examine the delivery of the mHealth intervention for improving HIV care and treatment, and (3) assess the cost-effectiveness of the mHealth intervention. METHODS: The 36-month study will use a facility cluster randomized controlled design (intervention vs standard of care) for evaluating the impact of mHealth on HIV care and treatment. Specifically, we will look at ART adherence, HIV viral load, retention in care, and condom use at 6 and 12-month follow-up. In addition, participant adoption and satisfaction with the program will be measured. This robust methodology will be complemented by qualitative interviews to obtain feedback on the motivational qualities of the program and benefits and challenges of delivery, especially for key populations. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, with health effects expressed in terms of viral load suppression and costs of resources used for the intervention. RESULTS: This study and protocol was fully funded, but it was terminated prior to review from ethics boards and study implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This cluster-RCT would have provided insights into the health effects, motivational qualities, and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions for PLHIV in public sector settings. We are seeking funding from alternate sources to implement the trial."

Because the impact of chronic pain is worsened by obesity and inactivity, nonpharmacological interventions that promote movement, reduce sitting, and aid in weight loss are needed to help manage pain symptoms among older adults with chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: The Mobile Intervention to Reduce Pain and Improve Health (MORPH) pilot trial aims to develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, patient-centered intervention to reduce chronic pain and improve physical functioning in older adults, leveraging the combination of telecoaching and individually adaptive mHealth tools to decrease both body mass and sedentary behavior. METHODS: MORPH comprises 2 phases, including a 1-year iterative development phase, and a 1-year pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). During the development phase, representative participants will engage in one-on-one structured interviews and a 1-week field test. The resulting feedback will be used to guide the development of the finalized MORPH intervention package. During the second phase, the finalized intervention will be tested in a pilot RCT (N=30) in which older adult participants with chronic pain and obesity will be assigned to receive the 12-week MORPH intervention or to a waitlist control. Primary outcomes include self-reported pain symptoms and physical function. RESULTS: Phase 1 recruitment is ongoing as of December 2017. CONCLUSIONS: The MORPH intervention brings together a strong body of evidence using group-based behavioral intervention designs with contemporary mHealth principles, allowing for intervention when and where it matters the most. Given the ubiquity of smartphone devices and the popularity of consumer activity and weight monitors, the results of this study may serve to inform the development of scalable, socially driven behavioral pain management interventions.

"Adapting a Motivational Interviewing Intervention to Improve HIV Prevention Among Young, Black, Sexual Minority Men in Alabama: Protocol for the Development of the Kings Digital Health Intervention","Budhwani H, Kiszla BM, Outlaw AY, Oster RA, Mugavero MJ, Johnson MO, Hightow-Weidman LB, Naar S, Turan JM.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Jul 13;11(7):e36655. doi: 10.2196/36655.,Budhwani H,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/07/13,PMC9330190,,10.2196/36655,"BACKGROUND: African American or Black young men who have sex with men (BYMSM) are at a disproportionate risk for contracting HIV and have high rates of undiagnosed, and therefore untreated, HIV infection. In the southern United States, BYMSM face region-specific hurdles to HIV prevention, such as limited access to care and high levels of racism and intersectional stigma, necessitating HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis interventions that address sociocultural and structural barriers while motivating BYMSM to engage in prevention. Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB) is a motivational interviewing behavioral intervention that successfully and simultaneously increased community-based HIV testing and prevention counseling and education among BYMSM in the midwestern United States. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this protocol is to detail the process for the adaption of the BSB intervention for midwestern BYMSM to the Kings intervention for southern BYMSM. During the adaptation process, the intervention will be modernized to include rapid HIV testing, as opposed to HIV testing that requires BYMSM to return for test results, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and the provision of structural supports, and for relevance in the southern United States. METHODS: Aim 1 is to gather qualitative data through focus groups and in-depth interviews with BYMSM aged 18 to 29 years in Alabama and in-depth interviews with prevention and outreach workers who routinely work with BYMSM in Alabama. NVivo qualitative software (QSR International) will be used for the coding and analysis of the transcripts via a thematic analysis approach. For aim 2, intervention mapping will guide the adaptation process, intervention content, components, and design. Both aims 1 and 2 will leverage the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment implementation science framework, with emphasis on the exploration and preparation phases of this model. By applying these frameworks, the original midwestern BSB intervention will be scientifically adapted to the southern BYMSM Kings intervention. RESULTS: This study is ongoing as of 2022 and is expected to conclude in 2024, with aims 1 and 2 being completed in 2023. Qualitative data will offer insight into the current real-world experiences and preferences of BYMSM in Alabama. Feedback will be collected through the adaptation process to inform intervention refinement. Institutional review board approvals have been received. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will inform next steps, that is, testing the Kings intervention for feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness in a pilot hybrid type 1 effective-implementation randomized controlled trial. The study results will provide insights about important considerations for HIV prevention among BYMSM in the southern United States.

"Designing Ruby: Protocol for a 2-Arm, Brief, Digital Randomized Controlled Trial for Internalized Weight Bias","Hopkins CM, Miller HN, Brooks TL, Mo-Hunter L, Steinberg DM, Bennett GG.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Nov 25;10(11):e31307. doi: 10.2196/31307.,Hopkins CM,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/11/29,PMC8663559,,10.2196/31307,"BACKGROUND: Weight bias internalization, also known as weight self-stigma, is a serious health concern for individuals with higher body weight. Weight bias internalization is associated with the greater avoidance of health care and health-promoting activities, disordered eating, social isolation, and weight gain. Elevated weight bias internalization has been associated with low self-compassion, yet few investigations have explored self-compassion as a potential mechanism for reducing internalized weight bias. OBJECTIVE: Ruby is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial that was designed to test the efficacy of a 4-week digital self-compassion intervention to reduce internalized weight bias compared with a wait-list control. METHODS: Adults with elevated internalized weight bias and a BMI of >30 kg/m(2) (N=80) were recruited. Ruby is a standalone digital trial that will be delivered entirely via a smartphone and will involve web-based data collection and text messages. The intervention content will include psychoeducation and daily mindfulness practices with a focus on self-compassion and body concerns. We will use intent-to-treat analyses to examine changes in weight bias internalization throughout time by treatment arm. The analyses will be conducted by using one-way analysis of covariance models and linear mixed models. RESULTS: The protocol was designed in May 2020 and approved in December 2020. Data collection is currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: Ruby will be the first digital standalone, self-compassion-based intervention designed to reduce internalized weight bias. Owing to its standalone digital delivery, Ruby may be a highly scalable treatment for internalized weight bias that can be delivered on its own or combined with other treatments. We expect Ruby to be accessible to many, as participants can access the digital intervention at times of the day that are the most convenient in their schedule and are not burdened by in-person time commitments, which can be a barrier for participants with competing demands on their time and resources. If efficacious, Ruby will be poised to expand a burgeoning body of literature related to psychological intervention in this area.

This dual disorder often starts during youth and leads to significant societal costs, including lower employability rates, more hospitalizations, and higher risk of homelessness and of suicide attempts when compared to those with a serious mental illness without substance misuse. Moreover, many individuals presenting with comorbid disorders also present with other psychological difficulties as well, such as personality disorders or anxiety and depression, also known as complex comorbid disorders. Transdiagnostic treatments that focus on core difficulties found in people with complex dual disorders, such as emotional regulation, are direly needed. Emotional regulation skills can help reduce distress related to psychotic symptoms and maintain abstinence in substance use disorders. New technologies in the field of communications have developed considerably over the past decade and have the potential to improve access to such treatments, a major problem in many health care settings. As such, this paper aims at: presenting core difficulties present in many individuals with dual disorders, reviewing the scientific literature pertaining to the use of mobile applications in mental health and addictions, and presenting the development and potential of a new application for emotional regulation for people with dual disorders."
Effect of Mobile Health on Obese Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Park SH, Hwang J, Choi YK.",Healthc Inform Res. 2019 Jan;25(1):12-26. doi: 10.4258/hir.2019.25.1.12.

METHODS: An electronic search was carried out using multiple databases. A meta-analysis of selected studies was performed. The effects of mHealth were analyzed using changes in body weight and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: We identified 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,318 participants who fit our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that body weight was reduced with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of -2.35 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.84 to -1.87). An examination of the impact of duration of intervention showed that weight loss was greater after 6 months of mHealth (WMD = -2.66 kg) than between three and four months (WMD = -2.25 kg); it was maintained for up to 9 months (WMD = -2.62 kg). At 12 months, weight loss was reduced to a WMD of -1.23 kg. BMI decreased with a WMD of -0.77 kg/m(2) (95% CI, -1.01 to -0.52). BMI changes were not statistically significant at 3 months (WMD = -1.10 kg/m(2)), but they were statistically significant at 6 months (WMD = -0.67 kg/m(2)). CONCLUSIONS: The use of mHealth for obese adults showed a modest short-term effect on body weight and BMI. Although the weight loss associated with mHealth did not meet the recommendation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, which considers a reduction of approximately 5 to 10 kg of the initial body weight as a successful intervention. Well-designed RCTs are needed to reveal the effects of mHealth interventions."

Approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 are affected by long-term symptoms. However, effective treatment strategies are lacking. The ErgoLoCo (Occupational Therapy [Ergotherapie] for Long COVID) study was designed to develop and evaluate a novel occupational therapy (OT) concept of online delivery of therapy for long COVID. OBJECTIVE: The primary study objective is to assess the feasibility of the online OT intervention in PCS. Secondary aims include the evaluation of online OT concerning cognitive problems, occupational performance, and social participation. METHODS: This randomized controlled interventional pilot study involves parallel mixed methods process analyses and a realist evaluation approach. A total of 80 clients with PCS aged at least 16 years will be recruited into two interventional groups. The control cohort (watch and wait) comprises 80 clients with long COVID. Treatment is provided through teletherapy (n=40) or delivery of prerecorded videos (n=40) using the same standardized OT concept twice weekly over 12 weeks. Analyses of quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews based on the theoretical framework of acceptability will be performed to assess feasibility. Focus group meetings will be used to assess how acceptable and helpful the intervention was to the participating occupational therapists. Standardized tests will be used to assess the initial efficacy of the intervention on neurocognitive performance; limitations in mobility, self-care, and everyday activities; pain; disabilities; quality of life (QoL); social participation; and anxiety and depression in PCS, and the possible effects of online OT on these complaints. RESULTS: The German Ministry of Education and Research provided funding for this research in March 2022. Data collection took place from October 2022 to August 31, 2023. Data analysis will be completed by the end of April 2024. We anticipate publishing the results in the fall of 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the enormous clinical need, effective and scalable treatment options for OT clients who have PCS remain scarce. The ErgoLoCo study will assess whether online-delivered OT is a feasible treatment approach in PCS. Furthermore, this study will assess the effect of the intervention on cognitive symptoms, QoL, and occupational performance and participation in everyday life. Particular emphasis will be placed on the experiences of clients and occupational therapists with digitally delivered OT. This study will pave the way for novel and effective treatment strategies in PCS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trial Registry DRKS00029990; https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00029990.

There are also many undiagnosed cases of early-stage PD, a period when therapeutic interventions would have the most value and least cost. The traditional ""passive"" approach, whereby clinicians wait for patients with symptomatic PD to seek treatment, is inadequate. Proactive, early identification of PD will allow timely therapeutic interventions, and digital health technologies can be scaled up in the identification and early diagnosis of cases. The Parkinson's disease risk survey (TCTR20231025005) aims to evaluate a digital population screening platform to identify undiagnosed PD cases in the Thai population. Recognizing the long prodromal phase of PD, the target demographic for screening is people aged >/= 40 years, approximately 20 years before the usual emergence of motor symptoms. Thailand has a highly rated healthcare system with an established universal healthcare program for citizens, making it ideal for deploying a national screening program using digital technology. Designed by a multidisciplinary group of PD experts, the digital platform comprises a 20-item questionnaire about PD symptoms along with objective tests of eight digital markers: voice vowel, voice sentences, resting and postural tremor, alternate finger tapping, a ""pinch-to-size"" test, gait and balance, with performance recorded using a mobile application and smartphone's sensors. Machine learning tools use the collected data to identify subjects at risk of developing, or with early signs of, PD. This article describes the selection and validation of questionnaire items and digital markers, with results showing the chosen parameters and data analysis methods to be robust, reliable, and reproducible. This digital platform could serve as a model for similar screening strategies for other non-communicable diseases in Thailand."
mHealth Technology Design and Evaluation for Early Childhood Health Promotion: Systematic Literature Review,"DeWitt A, Kientz J, Coker TR, Liljenquist K.",JMIR Pediatr Parent. 2022 Oct 6;5(4):e37718. doi: 10.2196/37718.,DeWitt A,JMIR Pediatr Parent,2022,2022/10/06,PMC9585442,,10.2196/37718,"BACKGROUND: Recent increases in smartphone ownership among underserved populations have inspired researchers in medicine, computing, and health informatics to design and evaluate mobile health (mHealth) interventions, specifically for those supporting child development and growth. Although these interventions demonstrate possible effectiveness at larger scales, few of these interventions are evaluated to address racial disparities and health equity, which are known factors that affect relevance, uptake, and adherence in target populations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to identify and document the current design and evaluation practices of mHealth technologies that promote early childhood health, with a specific focus on opportunities for those processes to address health disparities and health equity. METHODS: We completed a systematic literature review of studies that design and evaluate mHealth interventions for early childhood health promotion. We then analyzed these studies to identify opportunities to address racial disparities in early- and late-stage processes and to understand the potential efficacy of these interventions. RESULTS: Across the literature from medical, computing, and health informatics fields, we identified 15 articles that presented a design or evaluation of a parent-facing health intervention. We found that using mobile-based systems to deliver health interventions was generally well accepted by parents of children aged <5 years. We also found that, when measured, parenting knowledge of early childhood health topics and confidence to engage in health-promoting behaviors improved. Design and evaluation methods held internal consistency within disciplines (eg, experimental study designs were the most prevalent in medical literature, while computing researchers used user-centered design methods in computing fields). However, there is little consistency in design or evaluation methods across fields. CONCLUSIONS: To support more interventions with a comprehensive design and evaluation process, we recommend attention to design at the intervention (eg, reporting content sources) and system level; interdisciplinary collaboration in early childhood health intervention development can lead to large-scale deployment and success among populations.

Rural areas, in particular, are associated with higher prevalence of these conditions as well as higher levels of disability, which is likely related to other determinants that affect these communities. Although digital health has been identified as a potential solution to mitigate the impact of these determinants, it is also known that these populations may face barriers that limit the implementation of these interventions. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to comprehensively map the evidence regarding the implementation of digital health interventions in rural populations with chronic musculoskeletal conditions. We will include studies published from the year 2000; that report the use of digital interventions that promote prevention, treatment or monitoring of any chronic musculoskeletal condition or chronic pain from musculoskeletal origin, in patients that live in rural areas. This protocol follows the methodological framework for scoping reviews proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, as well as the Joana Briggs Institute (JBI) approach. We will conduct the search on Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus, as well as grey literature databases. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts followed by a full-text review to assess the eligibility of the articles. Data extracted will include the identification of the digital interventions used, barriers and enablers identified by the patients or healthcare providers, the patient-level outcomes measured, and the implementation strategies and outcomes reported. By mapping the evidence on the implementation of digital health interventions in rural communities with musculoskeletal conditions, this scoping review will enhance our understanding of their applicability in real-world settings."
Economic Evaluation of Pharmacist-Led Digital Health Interventions: A Systematic Review,"Park T, Kim H, Song S, Griggs SK.",Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Sep 22;19(19):11996. doi: 10.3390/ijerph191911996.,Park T,Int J Environ Res Public Health,2022,2022/10/14,PMC9565470,,10.3390/ijerph191911996,"There has been growing interest in integrating digital technologies in healthcare. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the economic value of pharmacist-led digital interventions. PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane databases were searched to select studies that had conducted economic evaluations of digital interventions by pharmacists for the period from January 2001 to February 2022. Economic evidence from 14 selected studies was synthesized in our analysis. Pharmacists used telephones, computers, web-based interventions, videotapes, smartphones, and multiple technologies for their digital interventions. Prior studies have reported the results of telephone-based interventions to be cost-effective. Alternatively, these interventions were found to be cost-effective when reevaluated with recently cited willingness-to-pay thresholds. In addition, pharmacist-led interventions based on computers, web-based interventions, smartphones, and multiple technologies have been reported to be cost-effective in previous studies. However, videotape-based intervention was found cost-ineffective because there was no significant difference in outcomes between the intervention and the usual care groups. If this intervention had been intensive enough to improve outcomes in the intervention group, favorable cost-effectiveness results could have been obtained. The economic evidence in the previous studies represented short-term economic values. Economic evaluations of the long-term value of digital interventions are warranted in future studies."

In this systematic review, we searched the indexing databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central for studies published between January 2007 and October 2019. We included studies of technologies that were: (i) mobile phone- or tablet-based, (ii) able to screen for, diagnose, or monitor an NCD of public health importance in LMICs, and (iii) targeting health professionals as users. We extracted disease type, intervention purpose, target population, study population, sample size, study methodology, technology stage, country of development, operating system, and cost. Our initial search retrieved 13,262 studies, 315 of which met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Cardiology was the most common clinical domain of the technologies evaluated, with 89 publications. mHealth innovations were predominantly developed using Apple's iOS operating system. Cost data were provided in only 50 studies, but most technologies for which this information was available cost less than 20 USD. Only 24 innovations targeted the ten NCDs responsible for the greatest number of disability-adjusted life years lost globally. Most publications evaluated products created in high-income countries. Reported mHealth technologies are well-developed, but their implementation in LMICs faces operating system incompatibility and a relative neglect of NCDs causing the greatest disease burden."

Even more so since most of them will have a positive effect on society by returning to work. However, many cancer survivors have unmet needs, especially when it comes to improving their quality of life (QoL). Only few survivors are able to meet all of the recommendations regarding well-being and there is a body of evidence that cancer survivors' needs often remain neglected from health policy and national cancer control plans. This increases the impact of inequalities in cancer care and adds a dangerous component to it. The inequalities affect the individual survivor, their career, along with their relatives and society as a whole. The current study will evaluate the impact of the use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on the self-efficacy of participants following intervention supported by digital tools. The secondary endpoints include evaluation of the impact of patient trajectories (from retrospective data) and patient gathered health data on prediction and improved intervention against possible secondary disease or negative outcomes (e.g. late toxicities, fatal events). METHODS/DESIGN: The study is designed as a single-case experimental prospective study where each individual serves as its own control group with basal measurements obtained at the recruitment and subsequent measurements performed every 6 months during follow ups. The measurement will involve CASE-cancer, Patient Activation Measure and System Usability Scale. The study will involve 160 survivors (80 survivors of Breast Cancer and 80 survivors of Colorectal Cancer) from four countries, Belgium, Latvia, Slovenia, and Spain. The intervention will be implemented via a digital tool (mHealthApplication), collecting objective biomarkers (vital signs) and subjective biomarkers (PROs) with the support of a (embodied) conversational agent. Additionally, the Clinical Decision Support system (CDSS), including visualization of cohorts and trajectories will enable oncologists to personalize treatment for an efficient care plan and follow-up management. DISCUSSION: We expect that cancer survivors will significantly increase their self-efficacy following the personalized intervention supported by the m-HealthApplication compared to control measurements at recruitment. We expect to observe improvement in healthy habits, disease self-management and self-perceived QoL. Trial registration ISRCTN97617326. https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN97617326 .

However, adherence and persistence to antiretroviral therapy are crucial for successful HIV treatment outcomes. People with HIV who use cocaine have poor access to HIV services and lower retention in care. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this paper is to provide a detailed description of a mobile health intervention. This study is designed to improve medication adherence among people with HIV who use cocaine. A secondary goal is to list the important challenges and adaptations incorporated in the study design. METHODS: This study, titled Project SMART, used a wireless technology-based intervention, including cellular-enabled electronic pillboxes called TowerView Health and smartphones, to provide reminders and feedback on adherence behavior. The intervention design was based on the theoretical frameworks provided by the self-determination theory and the Motivation Technology Model. The 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial with four arms provided three types of feedback: automated feedback, automated+clinician feedback, and automated feedback+social network feedback. RESULTS: The study was funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (R21DA039842) on August 1, 2016. The institutional review board for the study was approved by Yale University on March 21, 2017. Data collection lasted from June 2017 to January 2020. The final enrollment was 71 participants, of whom 57 (80%) completed the study. The data are currently undergoing analysis, and the manuscript is being developed for publication in early 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing complex mobile health interventions for high-risk and marginalized populations with multicomponent interventions poses certain challenges, such as finding companies with adequate technology for clients and financial stability and minimizing the research-related burden for the study population. Conducting feasibility studies is important to recognize these challenges and the opportunity to address these challenges with solutions while keeping the design of a randomized controlled trial as true as possible.

Four studies were included in the review, examining a variety of digital tools including mobile apps, SMS messaging, and wearable devices. These tools demonstrated efficacy in improving medication adherence, managing disease symptoms, and enhancing quality of life for patients and caregivers. Digital health interventions hold the potential to revolutionize medication adherence among chronic disease patients. By empowering informal caregivers, these tools can bridge the gaps in medication management and contribute to better health outcomes. Further research is warranted to optimize the design, implementation, and evaluation of digital interventions for medication adherence."
What Are We Measuring When We Evaluate Digital Interventions for Improving Lifestyle? A Scoping Meta-Review,"Castro R, Ribeiro-Alves M, Oliveira C, Romero CP, Perazzo H, Simjanoski M, Kapciznki F, Balanzá-Martínez V, De Boni RB.",Front Public Health. 2022 Jan 3;9:735624. doi: 10.3389/fpubh.2021.735624. eCollection 2021.,Castro R,Front Public Health,2022,2022/01/20,PMC8761632,,10.3389/fpubh.2021.735624,"Background: Lifestyle Medicine (LM) aims to address six main behavioral domains: diet/nutrition, substance use (SU), physical activity (PA), social relationships, stress management, and sleep. Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) have been used to improve these domains. However, there is no consensus on how to measure lifestyle and its intermediate outcomes aside from measuring each behavior separately. We aimed to describe (1) the most frequent lifestyle domains addressed by DHIs, (2) the most frequent outcomes used to measure lifestyle changes, and (3) the most frequent DHI delivery methods. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-ScR) Extension for Scoping Reviews. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science for publications since 2010. We included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials using DHI to promote health, behavioral, or lifestyle change. Results: Overall, 954 records were identified, and 72 systematic reviews were included. Of those, 35 conducted meta-analyses, 58 addressed diet/nutrition, and 60 focused on PA. Only one systematic review evaluated all six lifestyle domains simultaneously; 1 systematic review evaluated five lifestyle domains; 5 systematic reviews evaluated 4 lifestyle domains; 14 systematic reviews evaluated 3 lifestyle domains; and the remaining 52 systematic reviews evaluated only one or two domains. The most frequently evaluated domains were diet/nutrition and PA. The most frequent DHI delivery methods were smartphone apps and websites. Discussion: The concept of lifestyle is still unclear and fragmented, making it hard to evaluate the complex interconnections of unhealthy behaviors, and their impact on health. Clarifying this concept, refining its operationalization, and defining the reporting guidelines should be considered as the current research priorities. DHIs have the potential to improve lifestyle at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of prevention-but most of them are targeting clinical populations. Although important advances have been made to evaluate DHIs, some of their characteristics, such as the rate at which they become obsolete, will require innovative research designs to evaluate long-term outcomes in health."
Implementation of an internet-based stress management program in micro- and small-sized enterprises: a study protocol for a pre-post feasibility study of the effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 trial,"Sasaki N, Shimazu T, Takeno H, Ogawa S, Sawada U, Tsutsumi A, Imamura K.",Pilot Feasibility Stud. 2024 Apr 5;10(1):56. doi: 10.1186/s40814-024-01481-9.,Sasaki N,Pilot Feasibility Stud,2024,2024/04/05,PMC10996202,,10.1186/s40814-024-01481-9,"BACKGROUND: Although internet-based stress management programs are proven effective in improving mental health among workers, micro- and small-sized enterprises (MSEs), lacking in occupational healthcare services, face challenges implementing them. To address this gap, this study will develop the program with stakeholders at MSEs to aim for real-world implementation. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes a study protocol for a pre-post feasibility study of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 trial of text-based internet-based programs (""WellBe-LINE"") in MSEs with less than 50 employees. This feasibility study primarily aims to evaluate trial methods for future effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 trials. METHODS: For this study protocol, an internet- and text-based self-care intervention program using the LINE app (a popular message tool in Japan) will be prepared according to evidence-based psychoeducational topics. Based on our online survey findings, personalized algorithms will be implemented according to employees' gender, age, and psychological distress levels. A personalized program using a popular pre-existing text app is expected to reduce employees' burdens and be attractive to them, resulting in successful implementation outcomes and mental health benefits. A pre-post design feasibility study will be conducted on ten companies to evaluate trial methods (e.g., recruitment and procedures). The primary outcome will involve individual-level penetration, defined as the proportion of the number of employees who register for the program divided by the total number of invited employees at the company. The progression criterion to go next trial specifies that more than 50% of the recruited companies obtain 60% individual penetration, which is set based on the findings of the prior survey of employees at MSEs and of interviews of stakeholders involved in this study, and will be measured by LINE system. Finally, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility will be measured using internet-based questionnaires and interviews. DISCUSSION: This pre-post feasibility study for future effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 trials will provide in-depth knowledge about the successful implementation of text-based, semi-personalized, self-care mental health interventions in real-world settings using both quantitative and qualitative data. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study will help validate the effectiveness of text-based interventions using a widely used social networking service (SNS) tool for employees in MSEs.

Companion: A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial to Test an Integrated Two-Way Communication and Near-Real-Time Sensing System for Detecting and Modifying Daily Inactivity among Adults >60 Years-Design and Protocol,"Arguello D, Rogers E, Denmark GH, Lena J, Goodro T, Anderson-Song Q, Cloutier G, Hillman CH, Kramer AF, Castaneda-Sceppa C, John D.",Sensors (Basel). 2023 Feb 16;23(4):2221. doi: 10.3390/s23042221.,Arguello D,Sensors (Basel),2023,2023/02/28,PMC9965440,,10.3390/s23042221,"Supervised personal training is most effective in improving the health effects of exercise in older adults. Yet, low frequency (60 min, 1-3 sessions/week) of trainer contact limits influence on behavior change outside sessions. Strategies to extend the effect of trainer contact outside of supervision and that integrate meaningful and intelligent two-way communication to provide complex and interactive problem solving may motivate older adults to ""move more and sit less"" and sustain positive behaviors to further improve health. This paper describes the experimental protocol of a 16-week pilot RCT (N = 46) that tests the impact of supplementing supervised exercise (i.e., control) with a technology-based behavior-aware text-based virtual ""Companion"" that integrates a human-in-the-loop approach with wirelessly transmitted sensor-based activity measurement to deliver behavior change strategies using socially engaging, contextually salient, and tailored text message conversations in near-real-time. Primary outcomes are total-daily and patterns of habitual physical behaviors after 16 and 24 weeks. Exploratory analyses aim to understand Companion's longitudinal behavior effects, its user engagement and relationship to behavior, and changes in cardiometabolic and cognitive outcomes. Our findings may allow the development of a more scalable hybrid AI Companion to impact the ever-growing public health epidemic of sedentariness contributing to poor health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and early death."
A Digital Intervention for Australian Adolescents Above a Healthy Weight (Health Online for Teens): Protocol for an Implementation and User Experience Study,"Moores CJ, Maeder A, Miller J, Prichard I, Lewis LK, Bell LK, Macoustra A, Miller MD.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Oct 10;8(10):e13340. doi: 10.2196/13340.,Moores CJ,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/10/12,PMC6913688,,10.2196/13340,"BACKGROUND: More than one-fourth of Australian adolescents are overweight or obese, with obesity in adolescents strongly persisting into adulthood. Recent evidence suggests that the mid-teen years present a final window of opportunity to prevent irreversible damage to the cardiovascular system. As lifestyle behaviors may change with increased autonomy during adolescence, this life stage is an ideal time to intervene and promote healthy eating and physical activity behaviors, well-being, and self-esteem. As teenagers are prolific users and innate adopters of new technologies, app-based programs may be suitable for the promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviors and goal setting training. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the reach, engagement, user experience, and satisfaction of the new app-based and Web-based Health Online for Teens (HOT) program in a sample of Australian adolescents above a healthy weight (ie, overweight or obese) and their parents. METHODS: HOT is a 14-week program for adolescents and their parents. The program is delivered online through the Moodle app-based and website-based learning environment and aims to promote adolescents' lifestyle behavior change in line with Australian Dietary Guidelines and Australia's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Young People (aged 13-17 years). HOT aims to build parental and peer support during the program to support adolescents with healthy lifestyle behavior change. RESULTS: Data collection for this study is ongoing. To date, 35 adolescents and their parents have participated in one of 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: HOT is a new online-only program for Australian adolescents and their parents that aims to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors. This protocol paper describes the HOT program in detail, along with the methods to measure reach, outcomes, engagement, user experiences, and program satisfaction.

"Providing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Nonbinary, and Queer Adolescents With Nurturance, Trustworthiness, and Safety: Protocol for Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial Design","Coulter RW, Mahal IK, Lin CA, Schneider SK, Mathias AS, Baral K, Miller E, Abebe KZ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2024 Mar 19;13:e55210. doi: 10.2196/55210.,Coulter RW,JMIR Res Protoc,2024,2024/03/19,PMC10988370,,10.2196/55210,"BACKGROUND: Sexual and gender minority youths (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, nonbinary, and queer individuals) face elevated risks of substance use (eg, alcohol and tobacco) and mental health issues (eg, depressive symptoms and suicidality) compared to their cisgender heterosexual peers. These inequities are hypothesized to be reduced by building supportive high school environments via the training of school staff. An intervention that trains school staff to better understand and support sexual and gender minority youths and engage in positive bystander behaviors that protect them from bullying exposure may reduce disparities in drug and alcohol use among them. Experts, school staff, and sexual and gender minority youths developed Providing LGBTQ+ Adolescents with Nurturance, Trustworthiness, and Safety (PLANTS), a web-based intervention to train school staff on how to support, affirm, and protect sexual and gender minority youths. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the design of the PLANTS pilot trial primarily aimed at assessing its acceptability, usability, appropriateness, and feasibility. We hypothesize PLANTS will have high acceptability, usability, appropriateness, and feasibility as rated by the school staff. Secondary objectives focus on implementation, safety, and pre-post changes in high school staff outcomes, including self-efficacy and skills (eg, active-empathic listening and bullying intervention). Exploratory objectives focus on the impact of PLANTS on student health outcomes. METHODS: In a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, high schools in Massachusetts are allocated to PLANTS or an active comparator group (publicly available sexual and gender minority youths resources or training). High school staff complete pretest and posttest surveys containing validated scales. Primary outcomes are validated measures of acceptability, usability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention completed by staff during posttest surveys. To test our primary hypotheses for each outcome, we will calculate means and 95% CIs and P values using 1-sample 2-sided t tests against a priori thresholds or benchmarks of success. Secondary outcomes include staff's active-empathetic listening skills, self-efficacy for working with sexual and gender minority youths, bystander intervention behaviors for bullying and cyberbullying, and self-efficacy for PLANTS' change objectives completed during pretest and posttest staff surveys. Staff can also complete a posttest interview guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavior model and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Exploratory outcomes include student-level data collected via the 2021 and 2023 MetroWest Adolescent Health Surveys, a health behavior surveillance system in 30 Massachusetts schools. RESULTS: School enrollment began in May 2023 and participant enrollment began in June 2023. Data collection is expected to be completed by February 2024. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial will yield important information about the PLANTS intervention and provide necessary information to conduct a fully powered trial of the efficacy of PLANTS for reducing the deleterious health inequities experienced by sexual and gender minority youths.

Digital Health Psychosocial Intervention in Adult Patients With Cancer and Their Families: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Zhang Y, Flannery M, Zhang Z, Underhill-Blazey M, Bobry M, Leblanc N, Rodriguez D, Zhang C.",JMIR Cancer. 2024 Feb 5;10:e46116. doi: 10.2196/46116.,Zhang Y,JMIR Cancer,2024,2024/02/05,PMC10877499,,10.2196/46116,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer and their families often experience significant distress and deterioration in their quality of life. Psychosocial interventions were used to address patients' and families' psychosocial needs. Digital technology is increasingly being used to deliver psychosocial interventions to patients with cancer and their families. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to review the characteristics and effectiveness of digital health interventions on psychosocial outcomes in adult patients with cancer and their family members. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental studies that tested the effects of a digital intervention on psychosocial outcomes. The Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal checklists for RCTs and quasi-experimental studies were used to assess quality. Standardized mean differences (ie, Hedges g) were calculated to compare intervention effectiveness. Subgroup analysis was planned to examine the effect of delivery mode, duration of the intervention, type of control, and dosage on outcomes using a random-effects modeling approach. RESULTS: A total of 65 studies involving 10,361 patients (mean 159, SD 166; range 9-803 patients per study) and 1045 caregivers or partners (mean 16, SD 54; range 9-244 caregivers or partners per study) were included in the systematic review. Of these, 32 studies were included in a meta-analysis of the effects of digital health interventions on quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and self-efficacy. Overall, the RCT studies' general quality was mixed (applicable scores: mean 0.61, SD 0.12; range 0.38-0.91). Quasi-experimental studies were generally of moderate to high quality (applicable scores: mean 0.75, SD 0.08; range 0.63-0.89). Psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral strategies were commonly used. More than half (n=38, 59%) did not identify a conceptual or theoretical framework. Most interventions were delivered through the internet (n=40, 62%). The median number of intervention sessions was 6 (range 1-56). The frequency of the intervention was highly variable, with self-paced (n=26, 40%) being the most common. The median duration was 8 weeks. The meta-analysis results showed that digital psychosocial interventions were effective in improving patients' quality of life with a small effect size (Hedges g=0.05, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.10; I(2)=42.7%; P=.01). The interventions effectively reduced anxiety and depression symptoms in patients, as shown by moderate effect sizes on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total scores (Hedges g=-0.72, 95% CI -1.89 to 0.46; I(2)=97.6%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of digital health interventions on quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients. Future research with a clear description of the methodology to enhance the ability to perform meta-analysis is needed. Moreover, this study provides preliminary evidence to support the integration of existing digital health psychosocial interventions in clinical practice.

Digital health interventions for suicide prevention among LGBTQ: A narrative review,"Paudel K, Gautam K, Bhandari P, Shah S, Wickersham JA, Acharya B, Sapkota S, Adhikari SK, Baral PP, Shrestha A, Shrestha R.",Health Prospect. 2024 Mar;23(1):1-10. doi: 10.3126/hprospect.v23i1.62795. Epub 2024 Mar 11.,Paudel K,Health Prospect,2024,2024/04/22,PMC11027749,NIHMS1974321,10.3126/hprospect.v23i1.62795,"BACKGROUND: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) are prevalent within the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queers (LGBTQ) community, often exacerbated by challenges in accessing care and the perceived stigma and discrimination tied to disclosing one's identity. Digital health interventions that offer psychosocial self-help present a promising platform to reach individuals at risk of STBs, especially those who may not engage with conventional health services. This review aimed to assess the role of digital-based intervention in reducing STBs among LGBTQ individuals. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from three databases, PsycINFO, PubMed, and CINHAL, from 1st Jan 1990 to 31st December 2023. The review encompassed studies investigating the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of digital interventions on STBs, employing randomized control trials (RCTs), pseudo-RCTs, observational pre-posttest designs, and qualitative studies. Potential bias was evaluated using the McGill Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). RESULTS: Five non-overlapping studies were included, reporting data from 777 participants. The studies featured diverse types of digital interventions, including videos, online writing, and mobile applications. The studies included three RCTs, and two qualitative studies. Across most of these studies, notable enhancements or reductions in the proportion of participants reporting STBs were observed post-intervention, alongside improvements in help-seeking intentions. The findings underscored that the applications used in the studies were engaging, acceptable, and deemed feasible in effectively addressing suicide prevention among the LGBTQ community. CONCLUSION: Overall, digital interventions were found to be feasible and acceptable in suicide prevention among LGBTQ communities, demonstrating preliminary efficacy in increasing help-seeking behavior when experiencing suicidal thoughts and in reducing STBs. Therefore, advocating for widespread promotion and dissemination of digital health interventions is crucial, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited access to health services and heightened barriers to obtaining such services. Further research using fully powered RCT is imperative to assess the efficacy of these interventions."
The Effectiveness of Self-Guided Digital Interventions to Improve Physical Activity and Exercise Outcomes for People With Chronic Conditions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Stavric V, Kayes NM, Rashid U, Saywell NL.",Front Rehabil Sci. 2022 Jun 24;3:925620. doi: 10.3389/fresc.2022.925620. eCollection 2022.,Stavric V,Front Rehabil Sci,2022,2022/10/03,PMC9397696,,10.3389/fresc.2022.925620,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of self-guided digital physical activity (PA) and exercise interventions to improve physical activity and exercise (PA&E) outcomes for people living with chronic health conditions. Digital health interventions, especially those with minimal human contact, may offer a sustainable solution to accessing ongoing services and support for this population. METHODS: A comprehensive and systematic search was conducted up to December 2021, through seven databases, for randomized trials that evaluated the effect of self-guided web- or internet-based PA interventions on physical activity or exercise outcomes. Included studies had to have interventions with minimal human contact and interaction with participants needed to be automatically generated. All studies were screened for eligibility and relevant data were extracted. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. PA data were pooled, and forest plots were generated. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the eligibility criteria and included a total of 2,439 participants. There was wide variation in health conditions and intervention characteristics in mode and parameters of delivery, and in the application of theory and behavioral strategies. Self-reported PA in the intervention group was greater than controls at the end of the intervention [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1, 0.3] and at follow up (SMD 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5). The difference in objectively measured PA was small and non-significant (SMD 0.3, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.9). All interventions included behavioral strategies and ten of the sixteen were underpinned by theory. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided digital PA&E interventions provided a positive effect on PA immediately after the intervention. An unexpected and positive finding was a sustained increase in PA at follow-up, particularly for interventions where the behavioral strategies were underpinned by a theoretical framework. Interventions with minimal contact have the potential to support sustained PA engagement at least as well as interventions with supervision.

Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of digital technologies in mental health systems: a qualitative systematic review to inform a policy framework,"Berardi C, Antonini M, Jordan Z, Wechtler H, Paolucci F, Hinwood M.",BMC Health Serv Res. 2024 Feb 26;24(1):243. doi: 10.1186/s12913-023-10536-1.,Berardi C,BMC Health Serv Res,2024,2024/02/26,PMC10898174,,10.1186/s12913-023-10536-1,"BACKGROUND: Despite the potential for improved population mental health and wellbeing, the integration of mental health digital interventions has been difficult to achieve. In this qualitative systematic review, we aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of digital technologies in mental healthcare systems, and map these to an implementation framework to inform policy development. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for primary research articles published between January 2010 and 2022. Studies were considered eligible if they reported barriers and/or facilitators to the integration of any digital mental healthcare technologies. Data were extracted using EPPI-Reviewer Web and analysed thematically via inductive and deductive cycles. RESULTS: Of 12,525 references identified initially, 81 studies were included in the final analysis. Barriers and facilitators were grouped within an implementation (evidence-practice gap) framework across six domains, organised by four levels of mental healthcare systems. Broadly, implementation was hindered by the perception of digital technologies as impersonal tools that add additional burden of care onto both providers and patients, and change relational power asymmetries; an absence of resources; and regulatory complexities that impede access to universal coverage. Facilitators included person-cantered approaches that consider patients' intersectional features e.g., gender, class, disability, illness severity; evidence-based training for providers; collaboration among colleagues; appropriate investment in human and financial resources; and policy reforms that tackle universal access to digital health. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider the complex and interrelated nature of barriers across different domains and levels of the mental health system. To facilitate the equitable, sustainable, and long-term digital transition of mental health systems, policymakers should consider a systemic approach to collaboration between public and private sectors to inform evidence-based planning and strengthen mental health systems.

Blended Interventions to Change Behavior in Patients With Chronic Somatic Disorders: Systematic Review,"Kloek C, Bossen D, de Bakker DH, Veenhof C, Dekker J.",J Med Internet Res. 2017 Dec 21;19(12):e418. doi: 10.2196/jmir.8108.,Kloek C,J Med Internet Res,2017,2017/12/23,PMC5754569,,10.2196/jmir.8108,"BACKGROUND: Blended behavior change interventions combine therapeutic guidance with online care. This new way of delivering health care is supposed to stimulate patients with chronic somatic disorders in taking an active role in their disease management. However, knowledge about the effectiveness of blended behavior change interventions and how they should be composed is scattered. OBJECTIVE: This comprehensive systematic review aimed to provide an overview of characteristics and effectiveness of blended behavior change interventions for patients with chronic somatic disorders. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials published from 2000 to April 2017 in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Study characteristics, intervention characteristics, and outcome data were extracted. Studies were sorted based on their comparison group. A best-evidence synthesis was conducted to summarize the effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 25 out of the 29 included studies were of high quality. Most studies (n=21; 72%) compared a blended intervention with no intervention. The majority of interventions focused on changing pain behavior (n=17; 59%), and the other interventions focused on lifestyle change (n=12; 41%). In addition, 26 studies (90%) focused on one type of behavior, whereas 3 studies (10%) focused on multiple behaviors. A total of 23 studies (79%) mentioned a theory as basis for the intervention. The therapeutic guidance in most studies (n=18; 62%) was non face-to-face by using email, phone, or videoconferencing, and in the other studies (partly), it was face-to-face (n=11; 38%). In 26 studies (90%), the online care was provided via a website, and in 3 studies (10%) via an app. In 22 studies (76%), the therapeutic guidance and online care were integrated instead of two separate aspects. A total of 26 outcome measures were included in the evidence synthesis comparing blended interventions with no intervention: for the coping strategy catastrophizing, we found strong evidence for a significant effect. In addition, 1 outcome measure was included in the evidence synthesis comparing blended interventions with face-to-face interventions, but no evidence for a significant effect was found. A total of 6 outcome measures were included in the evidence synthesis comparing blended interventions with online interventions, but no evidence for a significant effect was found. CONCLUSIONS: Blended behavior change interventions for patients with chronic somatic disorders show variety in the type of therapeutic guidance, the type of online care, and how these two delivery modes are integrated. The evidence of the effectiveness of blended interventions is inconsistent and nonsignificant for most outcome measures. Future research should focus on which type of blended intervention works for whom."
Are remote psychotherapy/remediation efforts accessible and feasible in patients with schizophrenia? A narrative review,"Datta R, Vishwanath R, Shenoy S.",Egypt J Neurol Psychiatr Neurosurg. 2022;58(1):136. doi: 10.1186/s41983-022-00574-7. Epub 2022 Nov 18.,Datta R,Egypt J Neurol Psychiatr Neurosurg,2022,2022/11/23,PMC9673189,,10.1186/s41983-022-00574-7,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive remediation (CR) therapy provides an effective way to improve cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. With the advent of telehealth services, especially during COVID 19 pandemic, a suitable alternative can be found in computer and cell phone-based mental health interventions. Previous studies have proven that remote mental health interventions have by and large been successful. Remote psychotherapy/CR services can now be accessed through smartphone apps, iPads, laptops and wearable devices. This has the advantage of reaching a wider population in resource-limited settings. The lack of access to technology, difficulty in using these online interventions and lack of privacy provide impediments to the delivery of care through these online platforms. Further, as some previous studies have shown, there may be a high rate of dropout in people using remote mental health resources. We aim to look at the factors, which influence the accessibility of remote mental health interventions in schizophrenia. Additionally, we test the feasibility of these interventions and look at how they compare and the potential they hold for implementation in future clinical settings. RESULTS: We found remote cognitive remediation to be both accessible and feasible. Concerning features, however, are the high attrition rates and the concentration of the studies in Western populations. CONCLUSIONS: Remote interventions are a viable alternative to in-person psychotherapy when in-person resources may not always be present. They are efficacious in improving health outcomes among patients with schizophrenia. Further research into the widespread implementation of remote CR will be beneficial in informing clinical decision-making."

Although some interventions have combined digital with interpersonal (face-to-face or telephone) delivery, others have relied exclusively on digital delivery. Exclusively digital interventions have the advantages of greater cost-effectiveness and broader reach and as such can be a valuable resource for health care providers. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to focus on exclusively digital interventions to determine their effectiveness, identify behavior change techniques (BCTs), and investigate user engagement. METHODS: A total of 6 databases (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], PsycINFO, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL] Plus, Web of Science, and ProQuest) were searched for randomized controlled trials or pilot control trials of exclusively digital interventions to encourage healthy eating, physical activity, or appropriate weight gain during pregnancy. The outcome measures were gestational weight gain (GWG) and changes in physical activity and dietary behaviors. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2.0. Where possible, pooled effect sizes were calculated using a random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was mostly high (n=5) or moderate (n=3). Of the 11 studies, 6 reported on GWG as the primary outcome, 4 of which also measured changes in physical activity and dietary behaviors, and 5 studies focused either on dietary behaviors only (n=2) or physical activity only (n=3). The meta-analyses showed no significant benefit of interventions on total GWG for either intention-to-treat data (-0.28 kg; 95% CI -1.43 to 0.87) or per-protocol data (-0.65 kg; 95% CI -1.98 to 0.67). Substantial heterogeneity in outcome measures of change in dietary behaviors and physical activity precluded further meta-analyses. BCT coding identified 7 BCTs that were common to all effective interventions. Effective interventions averaged over twice as many BCTs from the goals and planning, and feedback and monitoring domains as ineffective interventions. Data from the 6 studies reporting on user engagement indicated a positive association between high engagement with key BCTs and greater intervention effectiveness. Interventions using proactive messaging and feedback appeared to have higher levels of engagement. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to interpersonal interventions, there is little evidence of the effectiveness of exclusively digital interventions to encourage a healthy diet, physical activity, or weight management during pregnancy. In this review, effective interventions used proactive messaging, such as reminders to engage in BCTs, feedback on progress, or tips, suggesting that interactivity may drive engagement and lead to greater effectiveness. Given the benefits of cost and reach of digital interventions, further research is needed to understand how to use advancing technologies to enhance user engagement and improve effectiveness."
Supporting People Who Have Lost a Close Person by Bereavement or Separation: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Two French-Language Internet-Based Interventions,"Debrot A, Kheyar M, Efinger L, Berthoud L, Pomini V.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Jun 23;11(6):e39026. doi: 10.2196/39026.,Debrot A,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/06/23,PMC9264124,,10.2196/39026,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based interventions (IBIs) are as efficient as face-to-face psychotherapy for a variety of mental health disorders, including complicated grief. Most evidence stems from guided IBIs. However, recent research indicates that the benefit of guidance is lower in more interactive IBIs. As such, providing guidance only to people requiring it (guidance on demand) appears a cost-effective solution. This is particularly important to develop given the recent rise in grief symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents the protocol of a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and adherence rate of 2 IBIs for grief-related symptoms after the loss a close one following death or romantic separation, using a guidance on demand framework. LIVIA 2.0 was developed based on theoretical and empirical findings on grief processes and IBIs, and it will be compared to LIVIA 1 that has already demonstrated its efficacy. OBJECTIVE: Our main hypotheses are that LIVIA 1 (control condition) and LIVIA 2.0 (experimental condition) increase participants' well-being and decrease their distress at posttest and at follow-up, that LIVIA 2.0 is more efficient than LIVIA 1 for all outcomes, and that LIVIA 2.0 has less dropouts than LIVIA 1. METHODS: Outcomes will be assessed at pretest, posttest (12 weeks later), and follow-up (24 weeks later). We will recruit 234 participants through a variety of means, including social media and contacts with the press. Primary outcomes are grief symptoms, depressive symptoms, and eudemonic well-being. Secondary outcomes are anxiety symptoms, grief coping strategies, aspects related to self-identity reorganization, and program satisfaction. LIVIA 2.0 participants will additionally undergo a weekly mood and grief symptom monitoring, allowing us to explore the short-term efficacy of the sessions. RESULTS: The creation and development of the content of LIVIA 2.0 was completed during the first phase of the project. Participant recruitment will begin in May 2022 and will last until January 2023. CONCLUSIONS: This study will emphasize the relevance of the innovations included in LIVIA 2.0 regarding the efficacy and dropout rate of IBIs for grief symptoms and will allow investigations on how these changes impact the demand for guidance. In the current postpandemic times, developing and assessing IBIs targeting grief symptoms are particularly critical given the rise in grief-related symptoms.

Supporting population mental health and wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: protocol for a sequential mixed-method study,"Risling T, Carlberg C, Kassam I, Moss T, Janssen P, Iduye S, Strudwick G.",BMJ Open. 2021 Nov 18;11(11):e052259. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052259.,Risling T,BMJ Open,2021,2021/11/19,PMC8602926,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052259,"INTRODUCTION: The global COVID-19 pandemic has reported to have a negative impact on the mental health and well-being of individuals around the world. Mental health system infrastructure, primarily developed to support individuals through in-person care, struggled to meet rising demand for services even prior to COVID-19. With public health guidelines requiring the use of physical distancing during the pandemic, digital mental health supports may be one way to address the needs of the population. Despite this, barriers exist in promoting and supporting access to existing and emerging digital resources. Text messaging may address some of these barriers, extending the potential reach of these digital interventions across divides that may separate some vulnerable or disadvantaged groups from essential mental health supports. Building on an existing knowledge synthesis project identifying key digital resources for improved mental health, this research will establish low-tech connections to assess need and better match access to services for those who need it most. The aim of this study is to codesign a customised two-way texting service to explore need and better align access to mental health supports for Canadians located in Saskatchewan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be completed in Saskatchewan, Canada. For this project, the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework will be used to support three phases of a sequential mixed-method study. An advisory committee of Saskatchewan residents will guide this work with the study team. A 10-week service will be launched to connect individuals with appropriately suited digital mental health interventions through the use of text messaging. In phase 1, implementation and prototyping will be conducted with collaborative codesign for key elements related to features of an enrolment survey and initial messaging content. Phase 2 will focus on advancing the effectiveness of the service using quantitative user data. In phase 3, an embedding approach will be used to integrate both qualitative and quantitative data collected to understand the overall acceptability, satisfaction and perceived benefit of the text messaging service. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics will be used as analytic methods. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received approval from the Research Ethics Board at the University of Saskatchewan. A knowledge dissemination plan has been developed that includes traditional academic approaches such as conference presentations, and academic publications, as well as mainstream approaches such as social media, radio and dissemination through the advisory committee."
A Smartphone Game to Prevent HIV Among Young Africans: Protocol for a Randomized Pilot Study of a Mobile Intervention,"Sabben G, Akelo V, Mudhune V, Ondeng'e K, Ndivo R, Stephenson R, Winskell K.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Mar 27;8(3):e11209. doi: 10.2196/11209.,Sabben G,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/03/28,PMC6456823,,10.2196/11209,"BACKGROUND: Young people aged under 25 years make up an increasing proportion of the population in emerging economies such as Kenya, where half of new adult HIV infections are among 15- to 24-year olds. Interventions targeting this age group have the potential to avert HIV infections among an increasingly large at-risk population. Interactive communication technologies offer a promising platform for reaching young people in engaging ways. OBJECTIVE: Tumaini is a narrative-based smartphone game designed to help young Africans protect themselves from HIV. The objective of this study was to pilot test the game, focusing on the data needed to inform a future randomized controlled efficacy trial, including assessments of study feasibility and safety. METHODS: The study took place in Kisumu Town, western Kenya, in spring 2017. The game-based intervention was pilot tested for 16 days with a sample of 60 preadolescents aged 11 to 14 years. Participant recruitment was initiated through schools. Participants were randomly assigned to the control or intervention arms of the study. One parent for each of the intervention arm participants was also recruited (n=30). The intervention arm participants were provided with smartphones on which Tumaini was loaded so that they could play the game at home. Youth completed behavioral surveys at baseline, posttest, and 6-week follow-up. The intervention arm participants provided quantitative feedback on their experience of the game-based intervention at posttest. They and their parents further participated in postintervention focus group discussions. Feasibility-related study metrics were collected on recruitment, enrollment, attrition, safety of participants, and return of phones. RESULTS: Recruitment and enrollment of the 60 preadolescents and parents were successfully completed within 18 days. No participants were lost to follow-up: all youth completed all 3 waves of the survey and 27 intervention arm youth and 22 parents and caregivers participated in the focus groups. No safety concerns were reported. All phones were returned after the intervention period; none were damaged or lost. All intervention arm participants initiated gameplay, recording a mean exposure time just under 27 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that it is feasible and safe to test a smartphone-based HIV prevention intervention for very young adolescents in urban and peri-urban sub-Saharan Africa by initiating recruitment in schools and temporarily providing youth participants with smartphones on which the game is loaded. A randomized controlled trial powered to assess the efficacy of the game-based intervention is being designed to be carried out in the same geographic area as the pilot, using similar methods.

An app-based training for adolescents with problematic digital-media use and their parents (Res@t digital): protocol for a cluster-randomized clinical trial,"Paschke K, Diestelkamp S, Zapf A, Busch K, Arnaud N, Prehn-Kristensen A, Reis O, Stark M, Cloes JO, Schulz AL, Brauer H, Krömer T, Thomasius R; Res@t Consortium.",Front Psychiatry. 2024 Jan 24;14:1245536. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1245536. eCollection 2023.,Paschke K,Front Psychiatry,2024,2024/02/08,PMC10847547,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1245536,"BACKGROUND: Digital media-use disorders (DMUD) in adolescents are a rising phenomenon associated with psychological distress, comorbid mental disorders, and high burden on affected families. Since the ICD-11 introduced criteria for gaming disorder, these can now be transferred to describe additional DMUD associated with social media platforms and streaming services. Most evidence for effective treatments comes from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, interventions based on theoretical models for adolescents and their parents are widely missing, leading to a significant clinical gap. METHODS: Res@t digital (Resource-Strengthening Training for Adolescents with Problematic Digital-Media Use and their Parents) is the app-based translation of the first model-based digital intervention for adolescents with DMUD and their parents based on CBT. It comprises separate but content-related modules for adolescents (Res@t-A) and parents (Res@t-P), applying multimodal techniques. The effectiveness of Res@t will be evaluated within a multicenter cluster-randomized controlled evaluator-blinded pre-post follow-up trial with the waitlist control group (CG). In addition to the Res@t program in the intervention group, both groups will receive treatment as usual within primary child and adolescent psychiatric/psychotherapeutic healthcare. The primary outcome addresses DMUD symptom reduction after 10 weeks. Secondary outcomes are related to a reduction in psychological and family-related problems and an increase in parental self-efficacy. All outcomes will be assessed using standardized self-report measures. A total of 1,334 participating adolescent-parent dyads from a large clinical network throughout Germany are planned to be included in the primary analyses based on an intention-to-treat approach, applying linear mixed models. DISCUSSION: Assuming superiority of Res@t over the control condition, the intervention has the potential to provide evidence-based treatment for a significant number of help-seeking families, supporting local healthcare structures and resources. It is a promising program for practicable implementation and flexible use in different settings. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://drks.de, DRKS00031043."
The therapist's role in the implementation of internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy for patients with depression: study protocol,"Mol M, Dozeman E, van Schaik DJ, Vis CP, Riper H, Smit JH.",BMC Psychiatry. 2016 Sep 30;16(1):338. doi: 10.1186/s12888-016-1045-9.,Mol M,BMC Psychiatry,2016,2016/10/08,PMC5045637,,10.1186/s12888-016-1045-9,"BACKGROUND: Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) for the treatment of depressive disorders is innovative and promising. Various studies have demonstrated large effect sizes up to 2.27, but implementation in routine practice lags behind. Mental health therapists play a significant role in the uptake of internet-based interventions. Therefore, it is interesting to study factors that influence the therapists in whether they apply internet-based therapy or not. This study, as part of the European implementation project MasterMind, aims to identity the factors that promote or hinder therapists in the use of iCBT in depression care. METHODS/DESIGN: The uptake of iCBT by therapists in routine mental health care practice for the treatment of depression will be evaluated by a mixed method approach, to provide an understanding of the implementation factors (quantitative), and to ascertain the facilitating and hindering factors in the involvement of therapists in the implementation of iCBT (qualitative). The involvement of therapists in the implementation of iCBT is analysed following the RE-AIM framework on the five dimensions Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. This enables us to evaluate the reach of therapists, the impact of iCBT on depression care, the extent to which therapists adopt iCBT, the extent to which iCBT is delivered as intended, and how iCBT can be maintained over time. DISCUSSION: The results will provide valuable insight into the role of therapists in the implementation of iCBT for depression in secondary mental health care settings. They will result in concrete recommendations for how therapists can be facilitated in implementing and up-scaling iCBT for depression."
Leveraging digital technology for social connectedness among adults with chronic conditions: A systematic review,"Wright PJ, Raynor PA, Bowers D, Combs EM, Corbett CF, Hardy H, Patel K.",Digit Health. 2023 Oct 3;9:20552076231204746. doi: 10.1177/20552076231204746. eCollection 2023 Jan-Dec.,Wright PJ,Digit Health,2023,2023/10/06,PMC10548813,,10.1177/20552076231204746,"PURPOSE: To review the evidence about the impact of digital technology on social connectedness among adults with one or more chronic health conditions. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Social Sciences, CINAHL, and Compendex were systematically searched for full-text, peer-reviewed empirical evidence published between 2012 and 2023 and reported using the PRISMA flow diagram. Articles were critically appraised applying the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Specific data were extracted based on the framework for social identity and technology approaches for health outcomes and then analyzed and synthesized. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies met study criteria. Evidence showed heterogeneity among research methodology, chronic health conditions, digital technology, and health outcomes. Technology use was influenced by factors such as usability, anonymity, availability, and control. More advanced digital technologies require higher digital literacy and improved accessibility features/modifications. Social support was the most measured aspect of social connectedness. The emotional and informational forms of social support were most reported; instrumental support was the least likely to be delivered. Self-efficacy for using technology was considered in seven articles. Sixteen articles reported health outcomes: 31.2% (n = 5) described mental health outcomes only, 18.8% (n = 3) reported physical health outcomes only, 31.2% (n = 5) detailed both physical and mental health outcomes, whereas 18.8% (n = 3) denoted well-being or quality-of-life outcomes. Most often, health outcomes were positive, with negative outcomes for selected groups also noted. CONCLUSION: Leveraging digital technology to promote social connectedness has the potential to affect positive health outcomes. Further research is needed to better understand the social integration of technology among populations with different contexts and chronic health conditions to enhance and tailor digital interventions."

Due to high personal, social, and economic consequences, proper management in its early stages is key to reducing disability. The aim of this project is to co-develop a digital intervention for pediatric chronic pain (Digital SPA) with end-users and to evaluate its effectiveness and implementation outcomes in Spain. METHODS: (Phase 1) Focus groups with patients, parents, and clinicians (n = 5-6 each) will inform about unmet pain care needs and provide a starting point for co-designing the intervention. (Phase 2) Content creation and usability testing will be based on the results of Phase 1, and the theory-driven development will follow the latest available evidence. The intervention will use validated psychological techniques focused on improving functioning by teaching pain coping skills. (Phase 3) Hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial. Participants (n = 195) will be adolescents aged 12-17 years old with chronic pain and one of their parents. Assessments include physical function, pain, sleep, anxiety, mood, satisfaction and adherence to the treatment, and number of visits to the emergency room. A qualitative framework analysis will be conducted with data from Phase 1. Effects of the intervention will be evaluated using linear multilevel modeling. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Behavioral Interventions Using Technology (BIT) frameworks will be used to evaluate implementation. DISCUSSION: This study is expected to produce a co-created evidence-based digital intervention for pediatric chronic pain and a roadmap for successful implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER TRN AND DATE OF REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (registered on 26 June 2023: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05917626). Contributions to the literature The implementation of digital health interventions has two major gaps: (1) adherence to treatment is suboptimal, and (2) the process of making the interventions available to the end-user in a sustainable way is often unsuccessful.In this study, we expect that assessing users' needs and co-designing an intervention with them will improve adherence.Documenting the implementation process from the project inception and integrating the results into an implementation framework will allow for replication and extension in different contexts.This study will increase the knowledge about implementation in a vulnerable population: adolescents with chronic pain without access to in-person multidisciplinary pain care."
Phone-Based Text Therapy for Youth Mental Health: Rapid Review,"Karnik V, Henderson H, Khan UR, Boyd J.",Interact J Med Res. 2023 Dec 14;12:e47250. doi: 10.2196/47250.,Karnik V,Interact J Med Res,2023,2023/12/14,PMC10755647,,10.2196/47250,"BACKGROUND: Mental illness has become a prevalent issue impacting adolescents worldwide. Many barriers, including stigma and poor health literacy, prevent this population group from accessing reliable mental health care services. Synchronous text-therapy counseling is an underused therapeutic approach in combating adolescent mental illness. Phone-based text therapy is uniquely placed to offer personalized counseling to adolescents through a familiar and engaging treatment modality. OBJECTIVE: This rapid review aims to understand the clinical effectiveness, usability, and accessibility of phone-based text therapy for youth mental health. METHODS: Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO were used to search for suitable literature. Five groups of keywords were used: those related to (1) ""therapy,"" (2) ""text,"" (3) ""phone,"" (4) ""youth,"" and (5) ""mental health."" Eligibility criteria were formed through the PICO (Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcome) framework. Studies were included if a synchronous phone-based text therapy intervention was used in an adolescent population, with an age range of 12-24 years. Only literature available in full-text, English, and a peer-reviewed journal was considered. Furthermore, a date limit of 5 years was set to reflect the recent development of digital interventions for mental health. Pertinent information from each study was tabulated, and a narrative synthesis was used to assess, describe, and organize the included studies comprehensively and concisely. RESULTS: Of the 771 studies dual screened, 7 studies were included in this rapid review. Most of the exclusions occurred due to the use of the wrong intervention, such as asynchronous messaging. The selected studies had a low risk of bias and were suitable for the review. All interventional trials demonstrated reductions in mental health symptoms, primarily depression and anxiety. Most studies displayed high usability among participants, while data were unclear regarding accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals the high potential of phone-based text therapy as an intervention for adolescents experiencing mental illness. We hope that this review promotes further refinement of text-based phone therapies and encourages future research on this subject matter."

ParentApp is an open-source, offline-first app-based adaptation of the Parenting for Lifelong Health for Parents and Teens programme to promote playful and positive parenting, reduce risks for sexual violence victimisation, and prevent violence against adolescents. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ParentApp compared to an attention-control group. METHODS: This study is a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial to test whether ParentApp reduces adolescent physical abuse, emotional abuse, and sexual violence risks and victimisation at 1 month and 12 months post-intervention. Caregivers of adolescents aged 10-17 years and their adolescent children (N = 2400 caregiver-adolescent dyads) will be recruited in urban and peri-urban communities in the Mwanza region of Tanzania. A total of 80 study clusters will be stratified and randomised (1:1) to the intervention group, who will receive ParentApp with support through a WhatsApp group, or to an attention-control group, who will receive a water, sanitation, and hygiene app. Quantitative data will be collected through outcomes questionnaires with caregivers and adolescents, administered at baseline, 4 months post-baseline, and 16 months post-baseline, as well as through routine implementation data and ParentApp engagement data. Qualitative data will be collected through individual interviews and focus groups with caregivers, adolescents, and implementing partner staff.

But there have been difficulties in its application. Quantitative systematic reviews such as meta-analysis doesn't allow us to fully identify and properly describe this subject. Thus, our study has two main objectives: a) ""to determine what evidence is available for synchronous e-mental health implementation""; and b) ""to develop a framework informed by a realist analysis for the implementation of synchronous e-mental health"". Methods: We will search MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases from 1st January 2015 to September 2020, with no language restriction. A systematic review with a narrative description and a realist synthesis will be conducted. Primary studies relating to adults with common mental health problems using any type of mobile mental health intervention that includes a synchronic component and communication with a mental health professional will be included. For the analysis, we will make a realist synthesis of the systematic reviews, using a grounded theory approach with an emergent approach to synthesize the information, prioritizing the systematic reviews with a lower risk of bias in the AMSTAR-2 tool. The realist synthesis will be based on the interpretation, integration, and inference of the evaluated elements and the generation of hypotheses to better understand the implementation process of synchronous e-mental health. Finally, we will present the overall assessment in a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. Conclusion: Our results will allow a better understanding of the facilitator and limitations in implementing e-mental health."

Leveraging electronic health records (EHR) to identify at-risk patients and increasing the reach of digital interventions through proactive electronic outreach provide a novel approach that may increase the number of individuals who engage with evidence-based treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to increase the reach of digital behavior change interventions by implementing a proactive electronic message system for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction among a large, at-risk population identified through an acute hospital EHR. METHODS: This protocol describes a 3-phase, mixed-methods implementation study to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and reach of a proactive electronic message system to digital interventions using a hospital's EHR system to identify eligible patients. In Phase 1, we will conduct focus group discussions with patients and hospital staff to assess the overall acceptability of the electronic message system. In Phase 2, we will conduct a descriptive analysis of the patient population in the hospital EHR regarding target risk behaviors and other person-level characteristics to determine the project's feasibility and potential reach. In Phase 3, we will send proactive messages to patients identified as smokers or risky drinkers. Messages will encourage and provide access to behavior change mobile apps via an embedded link; the primary outcome will be the proportion of participants who click on the link to access information about the apps. RESULTS: At the time of initial protocol submission, data collection was complete, but analysis had not begun. This study was funded by Cancer Research UK from April 2019 to March 2020. Health Research Authority approval was granted in June 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the reach of digital behavior change interventions can improve population health by reducing the burden of preventable death and disease.

Study protocol for a systematic review of evidence for digital interventions for comorbid excessive drinking and depression in community-dwelling populations,"Schulte B, Kaner EFS, Beyer F, Schmidt CS, O'Donnell A.",BMJ Open. 2019 Oct 17;9(10):e031503. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031503.,Schulte B,BMJ Open,2019,2019/10/20,PMC6803077,,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031503,"INTRODUCTION: Excessive drinking and depression are frequently comorbid and make a substantial contribution to the global non-communicable disease burden. A range of effective interventions and treatments exist for either excessive drinking or depression alone, including a positive emerging evidence base for the use of digital interventions. Computerised and/or smartphone delivered advice could provide flexible, coordinated support for patients with comorbid excessive drinking and depression. However, to date, no systematic review of the evidence has been conducted focused on the effectiveness of digital interventions for this specific comorbid population. This systematic review will identify and evaluate the effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing comorbid excessive drinking and depression in community-dwelling populations. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC and SCI from inception to end of July 2019 for randomised controlled trials that evaluate any personalised digital intervention for comorbid excessive drinking and depression and published in any language. Primary outcomes will be changes in quantity of alcohol consumed and depressive symptoms. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be undertaken independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. Meta-analytic methods will be used to synthesise the data collected relating to the primary outcomes of interest. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As a systematic review, ethical approval is not needed. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019130134."
Passive Sensor Data for Characterizing States of Increased Risk for Eating Disorder Behaviors in the Digital Phenotyping Arm of the Binge Eating Genetics Initiative: Protocol for an Observational Study,"Kilshaw RE, Adamo C, Butner JE, Deboeck PR, Shi Q, Bulik CM, Flatt RE, Thornton LM, Argue S, Tregarthen J, Baucom BRW.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Jun 2;11(6):e38294. doi: 10.2196/38294.,Kilshaw RE,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/06/02,PMC9204566,,10.2196/38294,"BACKGROUND: Data that can be easily, efficiently, and safely collected via cell phones and other digital devices have great potential for clinical application. Here, we focus on how these data could be used to refine and augment intervention strategies for binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN), conditions that lack highly efficacious, enduring, and accessible treatments. These data are easy to collect digitally but are highly complex and present unique methodological challenges that invite innovative solutions. OBJECTIVE: We describe the digital phenotyping component of the Binge Eating Genetics Initiative, which uses personal digital device data to capture dynamic patterns of risk for binge and purge episodes. Characteristic data signatures will ultimately be used to develop personalized models of eating disorder pathologies and just-in-time interventions to reduce risk for related behaviors. Here, we focus on the methods used to prepare the data for analysis and discuss how these approaches can be generalized beyond the current application. METHODS: The University of North Carolina Biomedical Institutional Review Board approved all study procedures. Participants who met diagnostic criteria for BED or BN provided real time assessments of eating behaviors and feelings through the Recovery Record app delivered on iPhones and the Apple Watches. Continuous passive measures of physiological activation (heart rate) and physical activity (step count) were collected from Apple Watches over 30 days. Data were cleaned to account for user and device recording errors, including duplicate entries and unreliable heart rate and step values. Across participants, the proportion of data points removed during cleaning ranged from <0.1% to 2.4%, depending on the data source. To prepare the data for multivariate time series analysis, we used a novel data handling approach to address variable measurement frequency across data sources and devices. This involved mapping heart rate, step count, feeling ratings, and eating disorder behaviors onto simultaneous minute-level time series that will enable the characterization of individual- and group-level regulatory dynamics preceding and following binge and purge episodes. RESULTS: Data collection and cleaning are complete. Between August 2017 and May 2021, 1019 participants provided an average of 25 days of data yielding 3,419,937 heart rate values, 1,635,993 step counts, 8274 binge or purge events, and 85,200 feeling observations. Analysis will begin in spring 2022. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a detailed description of the methods used to collect, clean, and prepare personal digital device data from one component of a large, longitudinal eating disorder study. The results will identify digital signatures of increased risk for binge and purge events, which may ultimately be used to create digital interventions for BED and BN. Our goal is to contribute to increased transparency in the handling and analysis of personal digital device data.

Building on Lessons Learned in a Mobile Intervention to Reduce Pain and Improve Health (MORPH): Protocol for the MORPH-II Trial,"Fanning J, Brooks AK, Hsieh KL, Kershner K, Furlipa J, Nicklas BJ, Rejeski WJ.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2021 Jul 19;10(7):e29013. doi: 10.2196/29013.,Fanning J,JMIR Res Protoc,2021,2021/07/19,PMC8329761,,10.2196/29013,"BACKGROUND: Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity, guarding against sustained sitting, and maintaining a healthy body weight represent important lifestyle strategies for managing older adults' chronic pain. Our first Mobile Health Intervention to Reduce Pain and Improve Health (MORPH) randomized pilot study demonstrated that a partially remote group-mediated diet and daylong activity intervention (ie, a focus on moving often throughout the day) can lead to improved physical function, weight loss, less pain intensity, and fewer minutes of sedentary time. We also identified unique delivery challenges that limited the program's scalability and potential efficacy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the MORPH-II randomized pilot study is to refine the MORPH intervention package based on feedback from MORPH and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of this revised package prior to conducting a larger clinical trial. METHODS: The MORPH-II study is an iteration on MORPH designed to pilot a refined framework, enhance scalability through fully remote delivery, and increase uptake of the daylong movement protocol through revised education content and additional personalized remote coaching. Older, obese, and low-active adults with chronic multisite pain (n=30) will be randomly assigned to receive a 12-week remote group-mediated physical activity and dietary weight loss intervention followed by a 12-week maintenance period or a control condition. Those in the intervention condition will partake in weekly social cognitive theory-based group meetings via teleconference software plus one-on-one support calls on a tapered schedule. They will also engage with a tablet application paired with a wearable activity monitor and smart scale designed to provide ongoing social and behavioral support throughout the week. Those in the control group will receive only the self-monitoring tools. RESULTS: Recruitment is ongoing as of January 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from MORPH-II will help guide other researchers working to intervene on sedentary behavior through frequent movement in older adults with chronic pain.

Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have potential to overcome barriers and offer accessible, evidence-based care to college students. However, to evaluate the true public health impact of evidence-based DMHIs, it is important to assess the reach and uptake rates of DMHIs on college campuses. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review to examine the reach (i.e., % of invited students who express interest) and uptake (i.e., % of enrolled participants who initiate an intervention) of DMHIs based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for college students. METHODS: Eight databases were searched. Inclusion criteria included: (1) college population; (2) experimental design; (3) CBT-based intervention; (4) intervention targeting specific mental health conditions; and (5) digital intervention. Reach and uptake rates were calculated from data reported. A systematic narrative review framework was used to synthesize results. RESULTS: Of 10,315 articles screened, 90 were included. Seventeen studies (19%) reported sufficient data to calculate reach; 35 studies (39%) reported uptake rates. Of studies that reported reach or uptake, most evaluated unguided (n = 20) or guided (n = 16) self-help programs. Measurement methods varied widely. Overall reach was low, whereas uptake was high among enrolled participants. DISCUSSION: Despite evidence that improving reach and uptake can increase the public health impact of DMHIs, most studies did not report on either outcome. Suggested practices to improve these outcomes, and their reporting, are discussed."

Despite obesity being preventable, over a quarter of the UK adult population is currently considered clinically obese (typically body mass index >/=35 kg/m(2)). Access to treatment for people with severe obesity is limited by long wait times and local availability. Online and group-based interventions provide means of increasing the accessibility of obesity prevention and treatment services. However, there has been no prior review of the effectiveness of group-based interventions delivered online for people with severe obesity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review protocol is to provide an evaluation of the effectiveness and usability of different types of online, group-based interventions for people with severe obesity. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) and the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study (PICOS) frameworks were used to structure this review. The review will systematically search 7 databases: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, APA PsycNet, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases. Two authors (MM-I and LB) will independently screen the titles and abstracts of identified articles, select studies for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria, and extract data into a standardized form. Any disagreements will be discussed and resolved by a third reviewer (EM) if necessary. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias 2 tool and a descriptive analysis will be used to evaluate effectiveness and usability. RESULTS: The systematic review has not yet been started. It is expected to be completed and submitted for publication by December 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will summarize the effectiveness and usability of online, group-based interventions for people with obesity. It will identify the types of online delivery that have the strongest support to help inform the development of more useful and engaging interventions for people with severe obesity.

Digital interventions for promoting sun protection and skin self-examination behaviors: A systematic review,"Niu Z, Bhurosy T, Heckman CJ.",Prev Med Rep. 2022 Jan 29;26:101709. doi: 10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101709. eCollection 2022 Apr.,Niu Z,Prev Med Rep,2022,2022/05/09,PMC9073560,,10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101709,"The skin cancer incidence rate has been rising, and digital health interventions can promote skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the outcomes of digital interventions that promote sun protection and skin self-examination (SSE). This review examined studies that utilized randomized controlled designs or quasi-experiments, included outcomes related to sun safety or SSE, employed at least one digital platform, and were published in English from January 2000 to October 2020. A total of 62 studies were included in the review. Digital modalities included web-based (e.g., websites) alone (n = 29), mobile-based (e.g., mobile apps) alone (n = 12), game-based (n = 1), emails or text messages alone (n = 8), videos alone (n = 6), social media (n = 3), both text messages and mobile apps (n = 2), or both text messages and video (n = 1). Most studies (n = 44) only evaluated sun protection-related outcomes, seven studies assessed SSE outcomes only, nine studies examined both, and two assessed other related outcomes. Digital interventions are effective compared to non-intervention control conditions in promoting sun safety or SSE. Almost all studies found digital interventions to be equally or more effective compared to non-digital interventions. This review suggests that although the digital interventions varied, they showed promising effects on improving sun protection or SSE outcomes. Future research should include more sophisticated phase-based and rigorous longitudinal research designs, additional investigation of social media and other newer technologies, as well as more detailed reporting of methods and results."
Telemonitoring of Elderly with Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes at the Primary Care Level: Protocol for a Multicentric Randomized Controlled Pilot Study,"Mihevc M, Zavrnik Č, Mori Lukančič M, Virtič T, Prevolnik Rupel V, Petek Šter M, Klemenc Ketiš Z, Poplas Susič A.",Zdr Varst. 2022 Sep 28;61(4):216-223. doi: 10.2478/sjph-2022-0029. eCollection 2022 Dec.,Mihevc M,Zdr Varst,2022,2022/11/09,PMC9597900,,10.2478/sjph-2022-0029,"INTRODUCTION: Arterial hypertension (AH) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) represent a significant burden for the public health system, with an exceptionally high prevalence in patients aged >/=65 years. This study aims to test the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring in elderly patients with AH and T2D at the primary care level. METHODS: A m ulti-centre, prospective, randomized, controlled t rial w ill be conducted. Patients a ged >/= 65 y ears with AH and T2D will be randomized in a 1:1 proportion to a mHealth intervention or standard care group. Patients in the intervention group will measure their blood pressure (BP) twice weekly and blood glucose (BG) once monthly. The readings will be synchronously transmitted via a mobile application to the telemonitoring platform, where they will be reviewed by a general practitioner who will indicate changes in measurement regimen or carry out a teleconsultation. The primary endpoint will be a change in systolic BP (SBP) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) relative to standard care up to 12 months after inclusion. Secondary endpoints will be a change in other observed clinical variables, quality-of-life indexes, and costs. EXPECTED RESULTS: Telemonitoring will be an acceptable method of care associated with significant reductions in SBP and HbA1c levels and an increase in quality-of-life indexes in the intervention group. However, the cost-effectiveness threshold (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below euro25,000/quality-adjusted life year) might not be reached. CONCLUSION: This study will provide new evidence for scaling up telemonitoring network at the primary care level and modifying telemonitoring protocols to achieve the best clinical and cost-effective outcomes."
Chatbots for Smoking Cessation: Scoping Review,"Whittaker R, Dobson R, Garner K.",J Med Internet Res. 2022 Sep 26;24(9):e35556. doi: 10.2196/35556.,Whittaker R,J Med Internet Res,2022,2022/09/12,PMC9514452,,10.2196/35556,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant progress in reducing tobacco use over the past 2 decades, tobacco still kills over 8 million people every year. Digital interventions, such as text messaging, have been found to help people quit smoking. Chatbots, or conversational agents, are new digital tools that mimic instantaneous human conversation and therefore could extend the effectiveness of text messaging. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to assess the extent of research in the chatbot literature for smoking cessation and provide recommendations for future research in this area. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through searches conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Scopus, as well as additional searches on JMIR, Cochrane Library, Lancet Digital Health, and Digital Medicine. Studies were considered if they were conducted with tobacco smokers, were conducted between 2000 and 2021, were available in English, and included a chatbot intervention. RESULTS: Of 323 studies identified, 10 studies were included in the review (3 framework articles, 1 study protocol, 2 pilot studies, 2 trials, and 2 randomized controlled trials). Most studies noted some benefits related to smoking cessation and participant engagement; however, outcome measures varied considerably. The quality of the studies overall was low, with methodological issues and low follow-up rates. CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to make a firm conclusion about the efficacy of chatbots for smoking cessation. Researchers need to provide more in-depth descriptions of chatbot functionality, mode of delivery, and theoretical underpinnings. Consistency in language and terminology would also assist in reviews of what approaches work across the field."
Evaluation of Digital Interventions for Physical Activity Promotion: Protocol for a Scoping Review,"De Santis KK, Jahnel T, Mergenthal L, Zeeb H, Matthias K.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2022 Mar 3;11(3):e35332. doi: 10.2196/35332.,De Santis KK,JMIR Res Protoc,2022,2022/03/03,PMC8931641,,10.2196/35332,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions (DIs) could support physical activity (PA) promotion, according to recent reviews. However, it remains unclear if and how DIs for PA promotion are evaluated; thus, it is unclear if they support behavior change in real-world settings. A mapping of evidence from published reviews is required to focus on the evaluation of DIs for PA promotion. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to investigate evaluation strategies for any outcome in the context of DIs for PA promotion by conducting a scoping review of published reviews. METHODS: Our scoping review adheres to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. The information sources include bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) and the bibliographies of the selected studies. The electronic search strategy was developed and conducted in collaboration with an experienced database specialist. The electronic search was conducted in English with no limits up to March 19, 2021, for sources with the terms digital intervention AND evaluation AND physical activity in titles or abstracts. After deduplication, 300 reviews selected from 4912 search results were assessed for eligibility by 2 authors working independently. The inclusion criteria were (1) healthy or clinical samples (population), (2) DIs for PA promotion (intervention), (3) comparisons to any other intervention or no intervention (comparison), (4) evaluation strategies (methods, results, or frameworks) for any outcome in the context of DIs for PA promotion (outcome), and (5) any published review (study type). According to the consensus reached during a discussion, 40 reviews met the inclusion criteria-36 from the electronic search and 4 from the manual search of the bibliographies of the 36 reviews. All reviews reported the evaluation strategies for any outcomes in the context of DIs for PA promotion in healthy or clinical samples. Data coding and the quality appraisal of systematic reviews are currently being performed independently by 2 authors. RESULTS: Our scoping review includes data from 40 published reviews (1 rapid review, 9 scoping reviews, and 30 systematic reviews). The focus of data coding is on evaluation strategies in the context of DIs for PA promotion and on the critical appraisal of the included systematic reviews. The final consensus regarding all data is expected in early 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions for PA promotion that are supported by digital technologies require evaluation to ensure their efficacy in real-world settings. Our scoping review is needed because it addresses novel objectives that focus on such evaluations and are not answered in the published reviews identified in our search. The evaluation strategies addressing DIs for PA promotion will be mapped to synthesize the results that have been reported in published reviews so far.

The main objective of this pilot study is to explore the preliminary effectiveness of the SbS-F program to decrease participant-reported depressive symptoms compared to enhanced care as usual (ECAU); and the secondary objectives are to explore the preliminary effectiveness of the SbS-F to decrease participant-reported anxiety symptoms and improve wellbeing, and to evaluate the potential for SbS-F implementation in real-world settings. METHODS: This trial will follow an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 1 trial design and utilize the Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to accelerate the translation of clinical research into more effective implementation strategies and policies. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to control and treatment groups. Control group participants will receive ECAU that consists of brief depression psychoeducation and referral to local community partners. Treatment group participants will receive a 5-session of digital intervention through a mobile phone application. The primary outcome (depression) and psychological secondary outcomes (anxiety symptoms and wellbeing) will be measured using validated instruments. To evaluate study implementation, an embedded mixed-methods design will be used to collect data from various stakeholders. Data then will be analyzed using intention to treat principle and reported following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important new knowledge about the preliminary effectiveness of SbS-F, a mobile application, as a digital mental health intervention and its scalability. If SbS-F shows positive results among OFWs in Macao, it has strong potential to be used by OFWs in other countries that may also experience depression and difficulty accessing mental health services.

Study protocol for an individually randomized control trial for India's first roleplay-based mobile game for reproductive health for adolescent girls,"Saha A, Dixit A, Shankar L, Battala M, Khan N, Saggurti N, Ayyagari K, Raj A, Howard S.",Reprod Health. 2023 Sep 14;20(1):140. doi: 10.1186/s12978-023-01665-1.,Saha A,Reprod Health,2023,2023/09/14,PMC10503021,,10.1186/s12978-023-01665-1,"BACKGROUND: Go Nisha Go (GNG), is a mobile game combining behavioural science, human-centric design, game-based learning, and interactive storytelling. The model uses a direct-to-consumer (DTC) approach to deliver information, products, services, interactive learning, and agency-building experiences directly to girls. The game's five episodes focus on issues of menstrual health management, fertility awareness, consent, contraception, and negotiation for delay of marriage and career. The game's effectiveness on indicators linked to these issues will be measured using an encouragement design in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: A two-arm RCT will be conducted in three cities in India: Patna, Jaipur, and Delhi-NCR. The first arm is the treatment (encouragement) arm (n = 975) where the participants will be encouraged to download and play the game, and the second arm (n = 975) where the participants will not receive any nudges/encouragement to play the game. They may or may not have access to the game. After the baseline recruitment, participants will be randomly assigned to these two arms across the three locations. Participants of the treatment/encouragement arm will receive continuous support as part of the encouragement design to adopt, install the game from the Google Play Store at no cost, and play all levels on their Android devices. The encouragement activity will continue for ten weeks, during which participants will receive creative messages via weekly phone calls and WhatsApp messages. We will conduct the follow-up survey with all the participants (n = 1950) from the baseline survey after ten weeks of exposure. We will conduct 60 in-depth qualitative interviews (20 at each location) with a sub-sample of the participants from the encouragement arm to augment the quantitative surveys. DISCUSSION: Following pre-testing of survey tools for feasibility of methodologies, we will recruit participants, randomize, collect baseline data, execute the encouragement design, and conduct the follow-up survey with eligible adolescents as written in the study protocol. Our study will add insights for the implementation of an encouragement design in RCTs with adolescent girls in the spectrum of game-based learning on sexual and reproductive health in India. Our study will provide evidence to support the outcome evaluation of the digital mobile game app, GNG. To our knowledge this is the first ever outcome evaluation study for a game-based application, and this study is expected to facilitate scalability of a direct-to-consumer approach to improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcomes in India.

Improving Implementation of eMental Health for Mood Disorders in Routine Practice: Systematic Review of Barriers and Facilitating Factors,"Vis C, Mol M, Kleiboer A, Bührmann L, Finch T, Smit J, Riper H.",JMIR Ment Health. 2018 Mar 16;5(1):e20. doi: 10.2196/mental.9769.,Vis C,JMIR Ment Health,2018,2018/03/18,PMC5878369,,10.2196/mental.9769,"BACKGROUND: Electronic mental health interventions (eMental health or eMH) can be used to increase accessibility of mental health services for mood disorders, with indications of comparable clinical outcomes as face-to-face psychotherapy. However, the actual use of eMH in routine mental health care lags behind expectations. Identifying the factors that might promote or inhibit implementation of eMH in routine care may help to overcome this gap between effectiveness studies and routine care. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the results of a systematic review of the scientific literature identifying those determinants of practices relevant to implementing eMH for mood disorders in routine practice. METHODS: A broad search strategy was developed with high sensitivity to four key terms: implementation, mental health care practice, mood disorder, and eMH. The reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was applied to guide the review and structure the results. Thematic analysis was applied to identify the most important determinants that facilitate or hinder implementation of eMH in routine practice. RESULTS: A total of 13,147 articles were screened, of which 48 studies were included in the review. Most studies addressed aspects of the reach (n=33) of eMH, followed by intervention adoption (n=19), implementation of eMH (n=6), and maintenance (n=4) of eMH in routine care. More than half of the studies investigated the provision of mental health services through videoconferencing technologies (n=26), followed by Internet-based interventions (n=20). The majority (n=44) of the studies were of a descriptive nature. Across all RE-AIM domains, we identified 37 determinants clustered in six main themes: acceptance, appropriateness, engagement, resources, work processes, and leadership. The determinants of practices are expressed at different levels, including patients, mental health staff, organizations, and health care system level. Depending on the context, these determinants hinder or facilitate successful implementation of eMH. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 37 determinants, three were reported most frequently: (1) the acceptance of eMH concerning expectations and preferences of patients and professionals about receiving and providing eMH in routine care, (2) the appropriateness of eMH in addressing patients' mental health disorders, and (3) the availability, reliability, and interoperability with other existing technologies such as the electronic health records are important factors for mental health care professionals to remain engaged in providing eMH to their patients in routine care. On the basis of the taxonomy of determinants of practices developed in this review, implementation-enhancing interventions can be designed and applied to achieve better implementation outcomes. Suggestions for future research and implementation practice are provided."
The Use of Mobile Assessments for Monitoring Mental Health in Youth: Umbrella Review,"Marciano L, Vocaj E, Bekalu MA, La Tona A, Rocchi G, Viswanath K.",J Med Internet Res. 2023 Sep 19;25:e45540. doi: 10.2196/45540.,Marciano L,J Med Internet Res,2023,2023/09/19,PMC10548333,,10.2196/45540,"BACKGROUND: Improving mental health in youth is a major concern. Future approaches to monitor and intervene in youth mental health problems should rely on mobile tools that allow for the daily monitoring of mental health both actively (eg, using ecological momentary assessments [EMAs]) and passively (eg, digital phenotyping) by capturing individuals' data. OBJECTIVE: This umbrella review aims to (1) report the main characteristics of existing reviews on mental health and young people, including mobile approaches to mental health; (2) describe EMAs and trace data and the mental health conditions investigated; (3) report the main results; and (4) outline promises, limitations, and directions for future research. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in 9 scientific databases (Communication & Mass Media Complete, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, the ProQuest Sociology Database, Web of Science, and PubMed) on January 30, 2022, coupled with a hand search and updated in July 2022. We included (systematic) reviews of EMAs and trace data in the context of mental health, with a specific focus on young populations, including children, adolescents, and young adults. The quality of the included reviews was evaluated using the AMSTAR (Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews) checklist. RESULTS: After the screening process, 30 reviews (published between 2016 and 2022) were included in this umbrella review, of which 21 (70%) were systematic reviews and 9 (30%) were narrative reviews. The included systematic reviews focused on symptoms of depression (5/21, 24%); bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, or psychosis (6/21, 29%); general ill-being (5/21, 24%); cognitive abilities (2/21, 9.5%); well-being (1/21, 5%); personality (1/21, 5%); and suicidal thoughts (1/21, 5%). Of the 21 systematic reviews, 15 (71%) summarized studies that used mobile apps for tracing, 2 (10%) summarized studies that used them for intervention, and 4 (19%) summarized studies that used them for both intervention and tracing. Mobile tools used in the systematic reviews were smartphones only (8/21, 38%), smartphones and wearable devices (6/21, 29%), and smartphones with other tools (7/21, 33%). In total, 29% (6/21) of the systematic reviews focused on EMAs, including ecological momentary interventions; 33% (7/21) focused on trace data; and 38% (8/21) focused on both. Narrative reviews mainly focused on the discussion of issues related to digital phenotyping, existing theoretical frameworks used, new opportunities, and practical examples. CONCLUSIONS: EMAs and trace data in the context of mental health assessments and interventions are promising tools. Opportunities (eg, using mobile approaches in low- and middle-income countries, integration of multimodal data, and improving self-efficacy and self-awareness on mental health) and limitations (eg, absence of theoretical frameworks, difficulty in assessing the reliability and effectiveness of such approaches, and need to appropriately assess the quality of the studies) were further discussed.

Digital Technologies for Monitoring and Improving Treatment Adherence in Children and Adolescents With Asthma: Scoping Review of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Milne-Ives M, Lam C, Meinert E.",JMIR Pediatr Parent. 2021 Sep 17;4(3):e27999. doi: 10.2196/27999.,Milne-Ives M,JMIR Pediatr Parent,2021,2021/09/17,PMC8486994,,10.2196/27999,"BACKGROUND: Inadequate pediatric asthma care has resulted in potentially avoidable unplanned hospital admissions and morbidity. A wide variety of digital technologies have been developed to monitor and support treatment adherence in children and adolescents with asthma. However, existing reviews need to be updated and expanded to provide an overview of the current state of research on these technologies and how they are being integrated into existing health care services and care pathways. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of the current research landscape and knowledge gaps regarding the use of digital technologies to support the care of children and adolescents with asthma. METHODS: This study was structured according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) and Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study frameworks. Five databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO) were systematically searched for studies published in English from 2014 onward. Two reviewers independently screened the references and selected studies for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria. Data were systematically extracted per research question, which were synthesized in a descriptive analysis. RESULTS: A wide variety of study characteristics, including the number and age of participants, study duration, and type of digital intervention, were identified. There was mixed evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Of the 10 studies that evaluated treatment adherence, 7 (70%) found improvements, but the evidence was inconsistent for asthma control (6/9, 67% of studies reported improvement or maintenance, but only 1 was significantly different between groups) and health outcome variables (5/9, 56% of studies found no evidence of effectiveness). The 6 studies that examined patient perceptions and assessments of acceptability and usability generally had positive findings. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of digital interventions are being developed and evaluated to support the monitoring and treatment adherence of children and adolescents with asthma. Meta-analyses are inhibited by the use of samples with a variety of overlapping age ranges; a theoretical framework for evaluating specific age groups would aid comparison between studies. Most studies found significant evidence for improved adherence to treatment or medications, but there was mixed evidence of the impact of the digital interventions on asthma control and other health outcomes. There are gaps in the literature relating to cost-effectiveness and integration with existing clinical care pathways. This study will be necessary to determine which digital interventions for children and young people with asthma are worth supporting and adopting in the clinical care pathways."
Digital Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Older Adults: Protocol for a Systematic Review,"Riadi I, Kervin L, Teo K, Churchill R, Cosco TD.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2020 Dec 23;9(12):e22738. doi: 10.2196/22738.,Riadi I,JMIR Res Protoc,2020,2020/12/23,PMC7787887,,10.2196/22738,"BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of older adults experiencing depression and anxiety. In response to heightened demands for mental health interventions that are accessible and affordable, there has been a recent rise in the number of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) that have been developed and incorporated into mental health treatments. Digital interventions are promising in their ability to provide researchers, medical practitioners, and patients with personalized tools for assessing behavior, consultation, treatment, and care that can be used remotely. Reviews and meta-analyses have shown the benefits of DMHIs for the treatment and prevention of depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, but there is still a lack of studies that focus on the benefits and use of DMHIs in the older population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the current evidence for the effect of technology-delivered interventions, such as smartphone/tablet applications, remote monitoring and tracking devices, and wearable technology, for the treatment and prevention of depression and anxiety in adults older than 50 years. METHODS: The academic databases SCOPUS, PsycINFO, AgeLine (EBSCO), and Medline (PubMed) will be searched from January 1, 2010, to the date of search commencement to provide a review of existing randomized controlled trial studies. The search will include 3 key concepts: ""older adults,"" ""digital intervention,"" and ""depression/anxiety."" A set of inclusion criteria will be followed during screening by two reviewers. Data will be extracted to address aims and objectives of the review. The risk of bias for each study will be determined using appropriate tools. If possible, a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed, and the heterogeneity of effect sizes will be calculated. RESULTS: Preliminary searches were conducted in September 2020. The review is anticipated to be completed by April 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The data accumulated in this systematic review will demonstrate the potential benefits of technology-delivered interventions for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders in older adults. This review will also identify any gaps in current studies of aging and mental health interventions, thereby navigating a way to move forward and paving the path to more accessible and user-friendly digital health interventions for the diverse population of older adults.

Application of Behavior Change Techniques in a Personalized Nutrition Electronic Health Intervention Study: Protocol for the Web-Based Food4Me Randomized Controlled Trial,"Macready AL, Fallaize R, Butler LT, Ellis JA, Kuznesof S, Frewer LJ, Celis-Morales C, Livingstone KM, Araújo-Soares V, Fischer AR, Stewart-Knox BJ, Mathers JC, Lovegrove JA.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2018 Apr 9;7(4):e87. doi: 10.2196/resprot.8703.,Macready AL,JMIR Res Protoc,2018,2018/04/11,PMC5913568,,10.2196/resprot.8703,"BACKGROUND: To determine the efficacy of behavior change techniques applied in dietary and physical activity intervention studies, it is first necessary to record and describe techniques that have been used during such interventions. Published frameworks used in dietary and smoking cessation interventions undergo continuous development, and most are not adapted for Web-based delivery. The Food4Me study (N=1607) provided the opportunity to use existing frameworks to describe standardized Web-based techniques employed in a large-scale, internet-based intervention to change dietary behavior and physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to describe techniques embedded in the Food4Me study design and explain the selection rationale and (2) to demonstrate the use of behavior change technique taxonomies, develop standard operating procedures for training, and identify strengths and limitations of the Food4Me framework that will inform its use in future studies. METHODS: The 6-month randomized controlled trial took place simultaneously in seven European countries, with participants receiving one of four levels of personalized advice (generalized, intake-based, intake+phenotype-based, and intake+phenotype+gene-based). A three-phase approach was taken: (1) existing taxonomies were reviewed and techniques were identified a priori for possible inclusion in the Food4Me study, (2) a standard operating procedure was developed to maintain consistency in the use of methods and techniques across research centers, and (3) the Food4Me behavior change technique framework was reviewed and updated post intervention. An analysis of excluded techniques was also conducted. RESULTS: Of 46 techniques identified a priori as being applicable to Food4Me, 17 were embedded in the intervention design; 11 were from a dietary taxonomy, and 6 from a smoking cessation taxonomy. In addition, the four-category smoking cessation framework structure was adopted for clarity of communication. Smoking cessation texts were adapted for dietary use where necessary. A posteriori, a further 9 techniques were included. Examination of excluded items highlighted the distinction between techniques considered appropriate for face-to-face versus internet-based delivery. CONCLUSIONS: The use of existing taxonomies facilitated the description and standardization of techniques used in Food4Me. We recommend that for complex studies of this nature, technique analysis should be conducted a priori to develop standardized procedures and training and reviewed a posteriori to audit the techniques actually adopted. The present framework description makes a valuable contribution to future systematic reviews and meta-analyses that explore technique efficacy and underlying psychological constructs. This was a novel application of the behavior change taxonomies and was the first internet-based personalized nutrition intervention to use such a framework remotely.

Are digital interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy effective? A systematic review protocol,"Griffiths SE, Brown KE, Fulton EA, Tombor I, Naughton F.",Syst Rev. 2016 Dec 1;5(1):207. doi: 10.1186/s13643-016-0390-6.,Griffiths SE,Syst Rev,2016,2016/12/02,PMC5131429,,10.1186/s13643-016-0390-6,"BACKGROUND: Behavioural support for smoking cessation in pregnancy can be effective; however, many pregnant women face barriers to seeking support to stop smoking. Some digital interventions have been found to be effective for smoking cessation in the general population and may be effective for supporting cessation in pregnancy due to their flexibility and the potential for personalisation. To date, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of digital interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy. This review aims to assess the following: (1) whether digital interventions are effective at promoting smoking cessation among pregnant women; (2) which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) or combinations of BCTs are associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy; and (3) whether the number of BCTs used is associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy. METHODS: This review will include digital interventions delivered largely through computer (PC or laptop), video/DVD, mobile phone (including smartphones) or portable handheld device (e.g. tablet, iPad) and include websites, mobile or tablet applications and SMS text messages. Interventions must be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials aimed at women who smoke in pregnancy, with smoking cessation as a measured outcome (preferably the latest available point prevalence smoking status measure taken during pregnancy, biochemically verified if available). Electronic bibliographic databases will be searched to identify suitable studies indexed in the following: Academic Search Complete, ASSIA, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search strategy will include key words and database-specific subject headings relating to 'pregnancy' and 'smoking' and synonyms for the terms 'digital' and 'randomised controlled trial'. Where required and where possible, the first and second authors will independently code interventions and control groups for BCTs. If data allows, meta-analyses will be used to assess intervention effectiveness and the effectiveness of BCTs. DISCUSSION: This systematic review will provide a detailed synthesis of the effectiveness of current research using digital interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy, to build on the evidence base and guide the development of future research in this area.

Birth and death notification via mobile devices: a mixed methods systematic review,"Vasudevan L, Glenton C, Henschke N, Maayan N, Eyers J, Fønhus MS, Tamrat T, Mehl GL, Lewin S.",Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2021 Jul 16;7(7):CD012909. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD012909.pub2.,Vasudevan L,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,2021,2021/07/16,PMC8785898,,10.1002/14651858.CD012909.pub2,"BACKGROUND: Ministries of health, donors, and other decision-makers are exploring how they can use mobile technologies to acquire accurate and timely statistics on births and deaths. These stakeholders have called for evidence-based guidance on this topic. This review was carried out to support World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: To assess the effects of birth notification and death notification via a mobile device, compared to standard practice. Secondary objectives: To describe the range of strategies used to implement birth and death notification via mobile devices and identify factors influencing the implementation of birth and death notification via mobile devices. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Global Health Library, and POPLINE (August 2, 2019). We searched two trial registries (August 2, 2019). We also searched Epistemonikos for related systematic reviews and potentially eligible primary studies (August 27, 2019). We conducted a grey literature search using mHealthevidence.org (August 15, 2017) and issued a call for papers through popular digital health communities of practice. Finally, we conducted citation searches of included studies in Web of Science and Google Scholar (May 15, 2020). We searched for studies published after 2000 in any language.  SELECTION CRITERIA: For the primary objective, we included individual and cluster-randomised trials; cross-over and stepped-wedge study designs; controlled before-after studies, provided they have at least two intervention sites and two control sites; and interrupted time series studies. For the secondary objectives, we included any study design, either quantitative, qualitative, or descriptive, that aimed to describe current strategies for birth and death notification via mobile devices; or to explore factors that influence the implementation of these strategies, including studies of acceptability or feasibility. For the primary objective, we included studies that compared birth and death notification via mobile devices with standard practice. For the secondary objectives, we included studies of birth and death notification via mobile device as long as we could extract data relevant to our secondary objectives. We included studies of all cadres of healthcare providers, including lay health workers; administrative, managerial, and supervisory staff; focal individuals at the village or community level; children whose births were being notified and their parents/caregivers; and individuals whose deaths were being notified and their relatives/caregivers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: For the primary objective, two authors independently screened all records, extracted data from the included studies and assessed risk of bias. For the analyses of the primary objective, we reported means and proportions, where appropriate. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and we prepared a 'Summary of Findings' table. For the secondary objectives, two authors screened all records, one author extracted data from the included studies and assessed methodological limitations using the WEIRD tool and a second author checked the data and assessments. We carried out a framework analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework to identify themes in the data. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in the evidence and we prepared a 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' table. MAIN RESULTS: For the primary objective, we included one study, which used a controlled before-after study design. The study was conducted in Lao People's Democratic Republic and assessed the effect of using mobile devices for birth notification on outcomes related to coverage and timeliness of Hepatitis B vaccination. However, we are uncertain of the effect of this approach on these outcomes because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low. The included study did not assess resource use or unintended consequences. For the primary objective, we did not identify any studies using mobile devices for death notification. For the secondary objective, we included 21 studies. All studies were conducted in low- or middle-income settings. They focussed on identification of births and deaths in rural, remote, or marginalised populations who are typically under-represented in civil registration processes or traditionally seen as having poor access to health services. The review identified several factors that could influence the implementation of birth-death notification via mobile device. These factors were tied to the health system, the person responsible for notifying, the community and families; and include: - Geographic barriers that could prevent people's access to birth-death notification and post-notification services - Access to health workers and other notifiers with enough training, supervision, support, and incentives - Monitoring systems that ensure the quality and timeliness of the birth and death data - Legal frameworks that allow births and deaths to be notified by mobile device and by different types of notifiers - Community awareness of the need to register births and deaths - Socio-cultural norms around birth and death - Government commitment - Cost to the system, to health workers and to families - Access to electricity and network connectivity, and compatibility with existing systems - Systems that protect data confidentiality We have low to moderate confidence in these findings. This was mainly because of concerns about methodological limitations and data adequacy. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We need more, well-designed studies of the effect of birth and death notification via mobile devices and on factors that may influence its implementation."
The effectiveness of e-healthcare interventions for mental health of nurses: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"Park JH, Jung SE, Ha DJ, Lee B, Kim MS, Sim KL, Choi YH, Kwon CY.",Medicine (Baltimore). 2022 Jun 24;101(25):e29125. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000029125.,Park JH,Medicine (Baltimore),2022,2022/06/27,PMC9276241,,10.1097/MD.0000000000029125,"BACKGROUND: Mental health problems, including burnout among nurses, are common and important. With the rapid development of information and communication technologies and the rise in use of smartphones, the use of e-mental health strategies is increasing in public and clinical settings, and initial clinical trials using this intervention have been conducted. This systematic review evaluated whether e-healthcare interventions improve burnout and other mental health aspects in nurses. METHODS: Six electronic databases including MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE (via Elsevier), the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and PsycARTICLES were searched to collect relevant randomized controlled trials up to January 28, 2021, using e-healthcare interventions for mental health in nurses. The e-healthcare intervention was classified as web-based, smartphone-based, and real-time online interventions. The primary outcome was burnout in this population. Due to the heterogeneity of the interventions used in the included studies, quantitative synthesis was not performed, but included studies were analyzed qualitatively. Also, the details of e-healthcare for the mental health of nurses were analyzed. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The 20-minute session of an online form of the emotional freedom technique was reported to significantly improve burnout severity compared to no intervention (P < .001). Other outcomes, such as career identity, quality of work life, workplace bullying, job stress, turnover intention, distress, anxiety, and resilience in nurses, were also reported to be improved by e-healthcare interventions. The methodological quality of the included studies was generally poor. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, there was some evidence that e-healthcare interventions may improve mental health outcomes, including burnout in nurses, compared with no intervention. However, due to the poor methodological quality and wide heterogeneity of the interventions and outcomes in the included studies, we were not able to reach sufficiently reliable conclusions. E-healthcare intervention for nurses in the new coronavirus disease era was discussed. High-quality clinical trials in this area should be conducted in the future."
"The feasibility of a strategy for the remote recruitment, consenting and assessment of recent referrals: a protocol for phase 1 of the On-Line Parent Training for the Initial Management of ADHD referrals (OPTIMA)","Kostyrka-Allchorne K, Ballard C, Byford S, Cortese S, Daley D, Downs J, French B, Glazebrook C, Goldsmith K, Groom MJ, Hall CL, Hedstrom E, Ibrahim Z, Jarvis C, Kovshoff H, Kreppner J, Lean N, Morris A, Gutierrez WM, Sayal K, Shearer J, Simonoff E, Thompson M, Zalewski L, Sonuga-Barke EJS.",Pilot Feasibility Stud. 2022 Jan 3;8(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s40814-021-00959-0.,Kostyrka-Allchorne K,Pilot Feasibility Stud,2022,2022/01/04,PMC8720938,,10.1186/s40814-021-00959-0,"BACKGROUND: In the UK, children with high levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention referred to clinical services with possible attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often wait a long time for specialist diagnostic assessment. Parent training (PT) has the potential to support parents during this difficult period, especially regarding the management of challenging and disruptive behaviours that often accompany ADHD. However, traditional face-to-face PT is costly and difficult to organise in a timely way. We have created a low-cost, easily accessible PT programme delivered via a phone app, Structured E-Parenting Support (STEPS), to address this problem. The overall OPTIMA programme will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of STEPS as a way of helping parents manage their children behaviour while on the waitlist. To ensure the timely and efficient evaluation of STEPS in OPTIMA, we have worked with children's health services to implement a remote strategy for recruitment, screening and assessment of recently referred families. Part of this strategy is incorporated into routine clinical practice and part is OPTIMA specific. Here, we present the protocol for Phase 1 of OPTIMA-a study of the feasibility of this remote strategy, as a basis for a large-scale STEPS randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: This is a single arm observational feasibility study. Participants will be parents of up to 100 children aged 5-11 years with high levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention and challenging behaviour who are waiting for assessment in one of five UK child and adolescent mental health or behavioural services. Recruitment, consenting and data collection will occur remotely. The primary outcome will be the rate at which the families, who meet inclusion criteria, agree in principle to take part in a full STEPS RCT. Secondary outcomes include acceptability of remote consenting and online data collection procedures; the feasibility of collecting teacher data remotely within the required timeframe, and technical difficulties with completing online questionnaires. All parents in the study will receive access to STEPS. DISCUSSION: Establishing the feasibility of our remote recruitment, consenting and assessment strategy is a pre-requisite for the full trial of OPTIMA. It can also provide a model for future trials conducted remotely."
Unveiling mechanisms of change in digital interventions for depression: Study protocol for a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis,"Domhardt M, Grund S, Mayer A, Büscher R, Ebert DD, Sander LB, Karyotaki E, Cuijpers P, Baumeister H.",Front Psychiatry. 2022 Oct 3;13:899115. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.899115. eCollection 2022.,Domhardt M,Front Psychiatry,2022,2022/10/20,PMC9574035,,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.899115,"INTRODUCTION: The efficacy and effectiveness of digital interventions for depression are both well-established. However, precise effect size estimates for mediators transmitting the effects of digital interventions are not available; and integrative insights on the specific mechanisms of change in internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs)-as related to key features like delivery type, accompanying support and theoretical foundation-are largely pending. OBJECTIVE: We will conduct a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) evaluating the mediators associated with therapeutic change in various IMIs for depression in adults. METHODS: We will use three electronic databases (i.e., Embase, Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO) as well as an already established database of IPD to identify relevant published and unpublished studies. We will include (1) randomized controlled trials that examine (2) mediators of (3) guided and unguided (4) IMIs with (5) various theoretical orientations for (6) adults with (7) clinically relevant symptoms of depression (8) compared to an active or passive control condition (9) with depression symptom severity as primary outcome. Study selection, data extraction, as well as quality and risk of bias (RoB) assessment will be done independently by two reviewers. Corresponding authors of eligible primary studies will be invited to share their IPD for this meta-analytic study. In a 1-stage IPD-MA, mediation analyses (e.g., on potential mediators like self-efficacy, emotion regulation or problem solving) will be performed using a multilevel structural equation modeling approach within a random-effects framework. Indirect effects will be estimated, with multiple imputation for missing data; the overall model fit will be evaluated and statistical heterogeneity will be assessed. Furthermore, we will investigate if indirect effects are moderated by different variables on participant- (e.g., age, sex/gender, symptom severity), study- (e.g., quality, studies evaluating the temporal ordering of changes in mediators and outcomes), and intervention-level (e.g., theoretical foundation, delivery type, guidance). DISCUSSION: This systematic review and IPD-MA will generate comprehensive information on the differential strength of mediators and associated therapeutic processes in digital interventions for depression. The findings might contribute to the empirically-informed advancement of psychotherapeutic interventions, leading to more effective interventions and improved treatment outcomes in digital mental health. Besides, with our novel approach to mediation analyses with IPD-MA, we might also add to a methodological progression of evidence-synthesis in psychotherapy process research.

Use of Mobile Devices to Help Cancer Patients Meet Their Information Needs in Non-Inpatient Settings: Systematic Review,"Richards R, Kinnersley P, Brain K, McCutchan G, Staffurth J, Wood F.",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2018 Dec 14;6(12):e10026. doi: 10.2196/10026.,Richards R,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,2018,2018/12/16,PMC6315262,,10.2196/10026,"BACKGROUND: The shift from inpatient to outpatient cancer care means that patients are now required to manage their condition at home, away from regular supervision by clinicians. Subsequently, research has consistently reported that many patients with cancer have unmet information needs during their illness. Mobile devices, such as mobile phones and tablet computers, provide an opportunity to deliver information to patients remotely. To date, no systematic reviews have evaluated how mobile devices have been used specifically to help patients meet to their information needs. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that describe the use of mobile interventions to enable patients with cancer meet their cancer-related information needs in non-inpatient settings, and to describe the effects and feasibility of these interventions. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched up until January 2017. Search terms related to ""mobile devices,"" ""information needs,"" and ""cancer"" were used. There were no restrictions on study type in order to be as inclusive as possible. Study participants were patients with cancer undergoing treatment. Interventions had to be delivered by a mobile or handheld device, attempt to meet patients' cancer-related information needs, and be for use in non-inpatient settings. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists were used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. A narrative synthesis was performed and findings were organized by common themes found across studies. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 1020 results. We included 23 articles describing 20 studies. Interventions aimed to improve the monitoring and management of treatment-related symptoms (17/20, 85%), directly increase patients' knowledge related to their condition (2/20, 10%), and improve communication of symptoms to clinicians in consultations (1/20, 5%). Studies focused on adult (17/20; age range 24-87 years) and adolescent (3/20; age range 8-18 years) patients. Sample sizes ranged from 4-125, with 13 studies having 25 participants or fewer. Most studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (12/20, 52%) or United States (7/20, 30%). Of the 23 articles included, 12 were of medium quality, 9 of poor quality, and 2 of good quality. Overall, interventions were reported to be acceptable and perceived as useful and easy to use. Few technical problems were encountered. Adherence was generally consistent and high (periods ranged from 5 days to 6 months). However, there was considerable variation in use of intervention components within and between studies. Reported benefits of the interventions included improved symptom management, patient empowerment, and improved clinician-patient communication, although mixed findings were reported for patients' health-related quality of life and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The current review highlighted that mobile interventions for patients with cancer are only meeting treatment or symptom-related information needs. There were no interventions designed to meet patients' full range of cancer-related information needs, from information on psychological support to how to manage finances during cancer, and the long-term effects of treatment. More comprehensive interventions are required for patients to meet their information needs when managing their condition in non-inpatient settings. Controlled evaluations are needed to further determine the effectiveness of these types of intervention."

Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) can help fill this healthcare gap, but such programmes have not yet been sufficiently evaluated in youth with PTSD. Aim: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of an IMI for youth with PTSD in a one-arm, non-randomised, prospective proof-of-concept feasibility study. Methods: We aim to recruit 32 youth between 15 and 21 years old with clinically relevant posttraumatic stress symptoms (CATS >/= 21), who will receive access to the IMI. The IMI consists of nine sessions involving psychoeducation, emotion regulation and coping skills, written-based imaginal exposure, cognitive restructuring and relapse prevention. Participants will be guided by an eCoach, who provides weekly semi-standardised written feedback on completed sessions and adherence reminders. We will use a formal feasibility framework to assess different dimensions of feasibility: (1) recruitment capability and resulting sample characteristics, (2) data collection procedures and outcome measures, (3) acceptability of the IMI and study procedures, (4) resources and ability to manage and implement the study and IMI and (5) participants' responses to the IMI in terms of symptom severity and satisfaction. Additionally, potential negative effects related to the intervention will be assessed. Assessments take place pre-, mid- and post-intervention and at follow-up, including semi-structured clinical telephone interviews for PTSD diagnostics at pre- and post-intervention assessment. Qualitative interviews will be conducted to investigate the youth perspectives on the IMI. Discussion: This study aims to determine the feasibility of a guided IMI for youth with PTSD to adapt the IMI as closely as possible to youth needs and to inform the design, procedure and safety management of a large-scale efficacy RCT. Trial registration: German Clinical Trials Register identifier: DRKS00023341. HIGHLIGHTS: Evidence-based care for adolescents after trauma is not widely available.* This study evaluates the feasibility of a guided trauma-focused Internet intervention as a time- and location-independent low-threshold treatment option for adolescents and young adults with posttraumatic stress disorder."

In Indonesia, treatment rates are low among university students because of the high cost of treatment, stigma and the limited availability of mental care services. Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in treating anxiety and depression in Western countries. However, little is known about the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Indonesia. In this paper, we describe how we culturally adapted an Internet-based intervention to meet the needs of Indonesian students with depression and anxiety based on the theoretical framework of Barrera et al. (2013). METHOD: We culturally adapted a Western Internet-based student intervention for depression and anxiety. This intervention consists of 8 guided online sessions. 50 students from Universitas Gadjah Mada Yogyakarta who have mild to moderate depression or anxiety as assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), will participate in a feasibility study in which we will test participants' satisfaction, system usability and uptake. Secondary outcomes include assessment of participants' depression, anxiety and quality of life. Outcomes will be measured pre and post intervention. DISCUSSION: The present paper presents the protocol of a pilot study aimed at assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally adapted intervention for Indonesian university students with depression and anxiety. The results from the feasibility study will further guide the development of the intervention and may inform the protocol of a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effectiveness of the Internet-based intervention."
Cultural accommodation of internet-based interventions for substance use and related disorders: a proposed comprehensive framework based on a pilot study and a literature review,"Gueta K, Harel-Fisch Y, Walsh SD.",Front Psychol. 2023 Jun 21;14:1063200. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1063200. eCollection 2023.,Gueta K,Front Psychol,2023,2023/07/07,PMC10321598,,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1063200,"Despite the low utilization rates of substance use and related disorders services, and the ability of internet-based interventions for substance use and related disorders (IBIS) to address challenges related to service engagement, limited attention has been placed on the processes for the accommodation of these interventions to diverse cultural settings. This study aimed to develop a framework for the cultural accommodation of IBIS across populations based on a pilot study and a literature review. A pilot study of cultural accommodation of an existing internet intervention for alcohol use was carried out in Israel, which involved focus groups and daily online surveys of prospective consumers (N = 24) as well as interviews with experts (N = 7) in the substance abuse treatment field. Thematic analysis revealed a range of themes that relate to the general Israeli culture and the specific Israeli drinking subculture, identified as needing to be addressed in the process of intervention accommodation. A comprehensive framework for cultural accommodation of IBIS is suggested, consisting of five stages: Technical and cultural feasibility; Engagement of target group; Identification of accommodation variables, Accommodation, and evaluation of the accommodated intervention. In addition, the framework consists of four dimensions of accommodation: Barriers and facilitators; Audio-visual materials and language; Mechanisms of change; Intersectional factors. We suggest that the proposed framework may serve as a guide for the cultural accommodation of existing internet-based interventions for substance use and related disorders across a range of cultural and geographical settings, thus augmenting the ecological validity of internet-based interventions for substance use and related disorders, expanding cross-cultural intervention research, and reducing health disparities worldwide."
Dissemination and Effectiveness of the Peer Marketing and Messaging of a Web-Assisted Tobacco Intervention: Protocol for a Hybrid Effectiveness Trial,"Faro JM, Orvek EA, Blok AC, Nagawa CS, McDonald AJ, Seward G, Houston TK, Kamberi A, Allison JJ, Person SD, Smith BM, Brady K, Grosowsky T, Jacobsen LL, Paine J, Welch JM Jr, Sadasivam RS.",JMIR Res Protoc. 2019 Jul 23;8(7):e14814. doi: 10.2196/14814.,Faro JM,JMIR Res Protoc,2019,2019/07/25,PMC6683651,,10.2196/14814,"BACKGROUND: Smoking continues to be the leading preventable cause of death. Digital Interventions for Smoking Cessation (DISCs) are health communication programs accessible via the internet and smartphones and allow for greater reach and effectiveness of tobacco cessation programs. DISCs have led to increased 6-month cessation rates while also reaching vulnerable populations. Despite this, the impact of DISCs has been limited and new ways to increase access and effectiveness are needed. OBJECTIVE: We are conducting a hybrid effectiveness-dissemination study. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning-based approach (recommender system) for computer-tailored health communication (CTHC) over a standard CTHC system based on quit rates and risk reduction. In addition, this study will assess the dissemination of providing access to a peer recruitment toolset on recruitment rate and variability of the sample. METHODS: The Smoker-to-Smoker (S2S) study is a 6-month hybrid effectiveness dissemination trial conducted nationally among English-speaking, current smokers aged >/=18 years. All eligible participants will register for the DISC (Decide2quit) and be randomized to the recommender system CTHC or the standard CTHC, followed by allocation to a peer recruitment toolset group or control group. Primary outcomes will be 7-day point prevalence and risk reduction at the 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include recruitment rate, website engagement, and patient-reported outcomes collected via the 6-month follow-up questionnaire. All primary analyses will be conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: The project is funded from 2017 to 2020 by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Enrollment was completed in early 2019, and 6-month follow-ups will be completed by late 2019. Preliminary data analysis is currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: Conducting a hybrid study with both effectiveness and dissemination hypotheses raises some unique challenges in the study design and analysis. Our study addresses these challenges to test new innovations and increase the effectiveness and reach of DISCs. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/14814."
Effectiveness of a gamified digital intervention based on lifestyle modification (iGAME) in secondary prevention: a protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Cuesta-Vargas AI, Biró A, Escriche-Escuder A, Trinidad-Fernández M, García-Conejo C, Roldan-Jimenez C, Tang W, Salvatore A, Nikolova B, Muro-Culebras A, Martín-Martín J, González-Sánchez M, Ruiz-Muñoz M, Mayoral F.",BMJ Open. 2023 Jun 14;13(6):e066669. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066669.,Cuesta-Vargas AI,BMJ Open,2023,2023/06/14,PMC10277100,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066669,"INTRODUCTION: Combating physical inactivity and reducing sitting time are one of the principal challenges proposed by public health systems. Gamification has been seen as an innovative, functional and motivating strategy to encourage patients to increase their physical activity (PA) and reduce sedentary lifestyles through behaviour change techniques (BCT). However, the effectiveness of these interventions is not usually studied before their use. The main objective of this study will be to analyse the effectiveness of a gamified mobile application (iGAME) developed in the context of promoting PA and reducing sitting time with the BCT approach, as an intervention of secondary prevention in sedentary patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised clinical trial will be conducted among sedentary patients with one of these conditions: non-specific low back pain, cancer survivors and mild depression. The experimental group will receive a 12-week intervention based on a gamified mobile health application using BCT to promote PA and reduce sedentarism. Participants in the control group will be educated about the benefits of PA. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire will be considered the primary outcome. International Sedentary Assessment Tool, EuroQoL-5D, MEDRISK Instruments and consumption of Health System resources will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. Specific questionnaires will be administered depending on the clinical population. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at 6 weeks, at the end of the intervention (12 weeks), at 26 weeks and at 52 weeks. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Portal de Etica de la Investigacion Biomedica de Andalucia Ethics Committee (RCT-iGAME 24092020). All participants will be informed about the purpose and content of the study and written informed consent will be completed. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and disseminated electronically and in print. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04019119."
Lifestyle interventions after colorectal cancer surgery using a mobile digital device: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Kim YI, Park IJ, Kim CW, Yoon YS, Lim SB, Yu CS, Kim JC, Lee Y, Kim H, Chung S, Choi CM, Lee HJ, Kim KW, Ko Y, Yun SC, Jo MW, Lee JW.",Medicine (Baltimore). 2022 Oct 14;101(41):e31264. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000031264.,Kim YI,Medicine (Baltimore),2022,2022/10/18,PMC9575786,,10.1097/MD.0000000000031264,"BACKGROUND: In treating colorectal cancer, surgical techniques and adjuvant treatments have advanced over the past century, but relatively less attention has been given to improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Recent studies report a significant association between cancer recurrence and patient lifestyle after surgery, hence emphasizing the need to assist patients to reduce this risk through appropriate lifestyle choices. The proposed study will evaluate the effects of digital interventions on lifestyle after surgery for colorectal cancer using mobile applications. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial design was proposed. A total of 320 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer aged between 20 and 70 years were to be enrolled and randomized in equal numbers into 4 groups (3 groups assigned to different mobile applications and a control group). Surveys that evaluate HRQOL, physical measurements, and metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and fat/muscle mass measurements by abdominal computed tomography (CT), will be conducted prior to surgery and every 6 months post-surgery for 18 months. Statistical analysis will be used to compare the outcomes between groups. DISCUSSION: Results from this study could provide evidence that easily accessible mobile applications can influence patient lifestyles. Results showing minimal effects of such applications could also be constructive for improving healthcare-related applications."
