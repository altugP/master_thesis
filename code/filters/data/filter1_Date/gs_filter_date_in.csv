Purpose

Psychosocial and health behaviour treatments and therapies can be extended beyond traditional research or clinical settings by using mobile technology to deliver interventions to individuals as they go about their daily lives. These ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are treatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) and in natural settings (i.e. real world). The goal of the present review is to synthesize and critique mobile technology-based EMI aimed at improving health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms.

Methods

Twenty-seven interventions using palmtop computers or mobile phones to deliver ambulatory treatment for smoking cessation, weight loss, anxiety, diabetes management, eating disorders, alcohol use, and healthy eating and physical activity were identified.

Results

There is evidence that EMI can be successfully delivered, are accepted by patients, and are efficacious for treating a variety of health behaviours and physical and psychological symptoms. Limitations of the existing literature were identified and recommendations and considerations for research design, sample characteristics, measurement, statistical analyses, and clinical implementation are discussed.

Conclusions

Mobile technology-based EMI can be effectively implemented as interventions for a variety of health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms. Future research should integrate the assessment and intervention capabilities of mobile technology to create dynamically and individually tailored EMI that are ecologically sensitive.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2800172/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:fVV-oKj_Si8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com

Background:
Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat major depressive disorder.


Objective:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary intervention and context sensing.


Methods:
We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients’ mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between patients’ self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks.


Results:
Promising accuracy rates (60% to 91%) were achieved by learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.82, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview measures of depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.81, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (bweek = –.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (betaweek = –.71, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58).


Conclusions:
Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development process are discussed.

Experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment offers unique insights into how people think, feel, and behave in their natural environments. Because the method is able to capture situational variation as it happens in “real time,” experience sampling has become an increasingly popular method in social and personality, psychology, and beyond. With the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the recent technical advances, conducting experience sampling studies on participants’ own devices has become increasingly easy to do. Here, we present one reliable, user-friendly, highly customizable, and cost-effective solution. The web-based application, SurveySignal, integrates the idea of using short message service (SMS) messages as signals and reminders, according to fixed or random schedules and of linking these signals to mobile surveys designed with common online survey software. We describe the method and customizable parameters and then present evaluation results from nine social–psychological studies conducted with SurveySignal (overall N = 1,852). Mean response rates averaged 77% and the median response delay to signals was 8 min. An experimental manipulation of the reminder signal in one study showed that installing a reminder SMS led to a 10% increase in response rates. Next to advantages and limitations of the SMS approach, we discuss how ecologically valid research methods such as smartphone experience sampling can enrich psychological research.",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilhelm-Hofmann/publication/274713688_SurveySignal/links/599deb7745851574f4b359e6/SurveySignal.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:baHIVzmhh98J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",journals.sagepub.com

Background:
Mobile device-based ecological momentary assessment (mobile-EMA) is increasingly used to collect participants' data in real-time and in context. Although EMA offers methodological advantages, these advantages can be diminished by participant noncompliance. However, evidence on how well participants comply with mobile-EMA protocols and how study design factors associated with participant compliance is limited, especially in the youth literature.


Objective:
To systematically and meta-analytically examine youth’s compliance to mobile-EMA protocols and moderators of participant compliance in clinical and nonclinical settings.


Methods:
Studies using mobile devices to collect EMA data among youth (age ≤18 years old) were identified. A systematic review was conducted to describe the characteristics of mobile-EMA protocols and author-reported factors associated with compliance. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the overall compliance across studies and to explore factors associated with differences in youths’ compliance.


Results:
This review included 42 unique studies that assessed behaviors, subjective experiences, and contextual information. Mobile phones were used as the primary mode of EMA data collection in 48% (20/42) of the reviewed studies. In total, 12% (5/42) of the studies used wearable devices in addition to the EMA data collection platforms. About half of the studies (62%, 24/42) recruited youth from nonclinical settings. Most (98%, 41/42) studies used a time-based sampling protocol. Among these studies, most (95%, 39/41) prompted youth 2-9 times daily, for a study length ranging from 2-42 days. Sampling frequency and study length did not differ between studies with participants from clinical versus nonclinical settings. Most (88%, 36/41) studies with a time-based sampling protocol defined compliance as the proportion of prompts to which participants responded. In these studies, the weighted average compliance rate was 78.3%. The average compliance rates were not different between studies with clinical (76.9%) and nonclinical (79.2%; P=.29) and studies that used only a mobile-EMA platform (77.4%) and mobile platform plus additional wearable devices (73.0%, P=.36). Among clinical studies, the mean compliance rate was significantly lower in studies that prompted participants 2-3 times (73.5%) or 4-5 times (66.9%) compared with studies with a higher sampling frequency (6+ times: 89.3%). Among nonclinical studies, a higher average compliance rate was observed in studies that prompted participants 2-3 times daily (91.7%) compared with those that prompted participants more frequently (4-5 times: 77.4%; 6+ times: 75.0%). The reported compliance rates did not differ by duration of EMA period among studies from either clinical or nonclinical settings.


Conclusions:
The compliance rate among mobile-EMA studies in youth is moderate but suboptimal. Study design may affect protocol compliance differently between clinical and nonclinical participants; including additional wearable devices did not affect participant compliance. A more consistent compliance-related result reporting practices can facilitate understanding and improvement of participant compliance with EMA data collection among youth.

Objective The experience sampling method (ESM) is a structured diary technique to appraise subjective experiences in daily life. It is applied in psychiatric patients, as well as in patients with somatic illness. Despite the potential of ESM assessment, the improved logistics and its increased administration in research, its use in clinical trials remains limited. This paper introduces ESM for clinical trials in psychiatry and beyond.

Methods ESM is an ecologically valid method that yields a comprehensive view of an individual's daily life. It allows the assessment of various constructs (eg, quality of life, psychopathology) and psychological mechanisms (eg, stress-sensitivity, coping). These constructs are difficult to assess using cross-sectional questionnaires. ESM can be applied in treatment monitoring, as an ecological momentary intervention, in clinical trials, or in single case clinical trials. Technological advances (eg, smartphone applications) make its implementation easier.

Results Advantages of ESM are highlighted and disadvantages are discussed. Furthermore, the ecological nature of ESM data and its consequences are explored, including the potential pitfalls of ambiguously formulated research questions and the specificities of ESM in statistical analyses. The last section focuses on ESM in relation to clinical trials and discusses its future use in optimising clinical decision-making.

Conclusions ESM can be a valuable asset in clinical trial research and should be used more often to study the benefits of treatment in psychiatry and somatic health.",https://mentalhealth.bmj.com/content/ebmental/19/3/86.full.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:yTXNpC6KpssJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",mentalhealth.bmj.com

Background:  Interactive and mobile technologies (i.e., smartphones such as Blackberries, iPhones, and palm-top computers) show promise as an efficacious and cost-effective means of communicating health-behavior risks, improving public health outcomes, and accelerating behavior change. The present study was conducted as a “needs assessment” to examine the current available mobile smartphone applications (e.g., apps) that utilize principles of ecological momentary assessment (EMA)—daily self-monitoring or near real-time self-assessment of alcohol-use behavior—to promote positive behavior change, alcohol harm reduction, psycho-education about alcohol use, or abstinence from alcohol.

Methods:  Data were collected and analyzed from iTunes for Apple iPhone©. An inventory assessed the number of available apps that directly addressed alcohol use and consumption, alcohol treatment, or recovery, and whether these apps incorporated empirically based components of alcohol treatment.

Results:  Findings showed that few apps addressed alcohol-use behavior change or recovery. Aside from tracking drinking consumption, a minority utilized empirically based components of alcohol treatment. Some apps claimed they could serve as an intervention; however, no empirical evidence was provided.

Conclusions:  More studies are needed to examine the efficacy of mobile technology in alcohol intervention studies.

Background

The experience sampling method (ESM) builds an intensive time series of experiences and contexts in the flow of daily life, typically consisting of around 70 reports, collected at 8–10 random time points per day over a period of up to 10 days.
Methods

With the advent of widespread smartphone use, ESM can be used in routine clinical practice. Multiple examples of ESM data collections across different patient groups and settings are shown and discussed, varying from an ESM evaluation of a 6-week randomized trial of mindfulness, to a twin study on emotion dynamics in daily life.
Results

Research shows that ESM-based self-monitoring and feedback can enhance resilience by strengthening the capacity to use natural rewards. Personalized trajectories of starting or stopping medication can be more easily initiated and predicted if sensitive feedback data are available in real time. In addition, personalized trajectories of symptoms, cognitive abilities, symptoms impacting on other symptoms, the capacity of the dynamic system of mental health to “bounce back” from disturbance, and patterns of environmental reactivity yield uniquely personal data to support shared decision making and prediction in clinical practice. Finally, ESM makes it possible to develop insight into previous implicit patterns of thought, experience, and behavior, particularly if rapid personalized feedback is available.
Conclusions

ESM enhances clinical practice and research. It is empowering, providing co-ownership of the process of diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and routine outcome measurement. Blended care, based on a mix of face-to-face and ESM-based outside-the-office treatment, may reduce costs and improve outcomes.

Background

Psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder are frequently unavailable and resource intensive. Mobile technology may improve access to evidence-based interventions and may increase their efficacy. We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of an augmentative mobile ecological momentary intervention targeting self-management of mood symptoms.

Methods

This was a randomized single-blind controlled trial with 82 consumers diagnosed with bipolar disorder who completed a four-session psychoeducational intervention and were assigned to 10 weeks of either: 1) mobile device delivered interactive intervention linking patient-reported mood states with personalized self-management strategies, or 2) paper-and-pencil mood monitoring. Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-point), 12 weeks (post-treatment), and 24 weeks (follow up) with clinician-rated depression and mania scales and self-reported functioning.

Results

Retention at 12 weeks was 93% and both conditions were associated with high satisfaction. Compared to the paper-and-pencil condition, participants in the augmented mobile intervention condition showed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms at 6 and 12 weeks (Cohen׳s d for both were d=0.48). However, these effects were not maintained at 24-weeks follow up. Conditions did not differ significantly in the impact on manic symptoms or functional impairment.

Limitations

This was not a definitive trial and was not powered to detect moderators and mediators.

Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety, although efficacious, typically requires 16–20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage youth in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo). Materials and Methods: We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues youth to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot study with nine youth (9–14 years old) examined the platform's feasibility as an adjunct to BCBT. Results: SmartCAT was found to be capable of supporting BCBT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both therapists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1–7 scale, with 1=“easy”). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14 min (standard deviation=0.98 min) to complete the entries. Conclusions: A smartphone app is feasible within CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integrating an m-health platform within BCBT for anxious children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011472/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:0Cxu68lIZgQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.liebertpub.com

Abstract

Self-reported pain intensity assessments are central to chronic pain research. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodologies are uniquely positioned to collect these data, and are indeed being used in the field. However, EMA protocols are complex, and many decisions are necessary in the design of EMA research studies. A systematic literature review identified 105 articles drawing from 62 quantitative EMA research projects examining pain intensity in adult chronic pain patients. Study characteristics were tabulated to summarize and describe the use of EMA, with an emphasis placed on various dimensions of decision-making involved in executing EMA methodologies. Most identified studies considered within-person relationships between pain and other variables, and a few examined interventions on chronic pain. There was a trend toward the use of smartphones as EMA data collection devices more recently, and completion rates were not reported in nearly one third of studies. Pain intensity items varied widely with respect to number of scale points, anchor labels, and length of reporting period; most used numeric rating scales. Recommendations are provided for reporting to improve reproducibility, comparability, and interpretation of results, and for opportunities to clarify the importance of design decisions.

Perspective

Studies that use EMA methodologies to assess pain intensity are heterogeneous. Aspects of protocol design, including data input modality and pain item construction, have the potential to influence the data collected. Thorough reporting on design features and completion rates therefore facilitates reproducibility, comparability, and interpretation of study results.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590018300300,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:oCCnDckaY3kJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract

mHealth tools may be a feasible modality for delivering evidence-based treatments and principles (EBPs), and may enhance treatment for eating disorders (EDs). However, research on the efficacy of mHealth tools for EDs and the extent to which they include EBPs is lacking. The current study sought to (i) review existing apps for EDs, (ii) determine the extent to which available treatment apps utilize EBPs, and (iii) assess the degree to which existing smartphone apps utilize recent advances in smartphone technology. Overall, existing ED intervention apps contained minimal EBPs and failed to incorporate smartphone capabilities. For smartphone apps to be a feasible and effective ED treatment modality, it may be useful for creators to begin taking utilizing the abilities that set smartphones apart from in-person treatment while incorporating EBPs. Before mHealth tools are incorporated into treatments for EDs, it is necessary that the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy be evaluated.

Objective:

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) are technologies used to track fluctuations in experiences and prompt behavioral responses within the context of a person’s daily life. Most commonly delivered via smartphone, EMA and EMI have potential to provide simple, cost-effective, and user-led treatment for psychotic disorders. This systematic review aimed to synthesize current research exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic disorders.

Methods:

A systematic search was conducted identifying studies published between 1980 and July 7, 2016, by searching PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with combinations of search terms related to mobile devices, EMA and EMI, and psychotic disorders.

Results:

Of 1,623 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for the review. These studies found satisfactory feasibility and acceptability and preliminary evidence of improved clinical outcomes. The interventions, which had a broad array of features, targeted remote monitoring of illness and symptoms, and they also targeted illness self-management by using momentary reminders or instructions for behaviors, including medication adherence, management of symptoms and psychosocial impairments, daily living skills, and goal achievement.

Conclusions:

The findings of this review provide preliminary support for the clinical utility of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Future research should explore further applications of these technologies with larger sample sizes and controlled designs.",https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201600523,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:84WShdv2CwUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",ps.psychiatryonline.org

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) are alternative approaches to retrospective self-reports and face-to-face treatments, and they make it possible to repeatedly assess patients in naturalistic settings and extend psychological support into real life. The increase in smartphone applications and the availability of low-cost wearable biosensors have further improved the potential of EMA and EMI, which, however, have not yet been applied in clinical practice. Here, we conducted a systematic review, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to explore the state of the art of technology-based EMA and EMI for major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 33 articles were included (EMA = 26; EMI = 7). First, we provide a detailed analysis of the included studies from technical (sampling methods, duration, prompts), clinical (fields of application, adherence rates, dropouts, intervention effectiveness), and technological (adopted devices) perspectives. Then, we identify the advantages of using information and communications technologies (ICTs) to extend the potential of these approaches to the understanding, assessment, and intervention in depression. Furthermore, we point out the relevant issues that still need to be addressed within this field, and we discuss how EMA and EMI could benefit from the use of sensors and biosensors, along with recent advances in machine learning for affective modelling.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/8/4/465,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:dp20udrtscQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.mdpi.com

Background:
Mental health problems are highly prevalent, and there is need for the self-management of (mental) health. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) can be used to deliver interventions in the daily life of individuals using mobile devices.


Objectives:
The aim of this study was to systematically assess and meta-analyze the effect of EMI on 3 highly prevalent mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, and perceived stress) and positive psychological outcomes (eg, acceptance).


Methods:
PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched for relevant publications, and the last search was done in September 2015. Three concepts were used to find publications: (1) mental health, (2) mobile phones, and (3) interventions. A total of 33 studies (using either a within- or between-subject design) including 43 samples that received an EMI were identified (n=1301), and relevant study characteristics were coded using a standardized form. Quality assessment was done with the Cochrane Collaboration tool.


Results:
Most of the EMIs focused on a clinical sample, used an active intervention (that offered exercises), and in over half of the studies, additional support by a mental health professional (MHP) was given. The EMI lasted on average 7.48 weeks (SD=6.46), with 2.80 training episodes per day (SD=2.12) and 108.25 total training episodes (SD=123.00). Overall, 27 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and after removing 6 outliers, a medium effect was found on mental health in the within-subject analyses (n=1008), with g=0.57 and 95% CI (0.45-0.70). This effect did not differ as function of outcome type (ie, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, acceptance, relaxation, and quality of life). The only moderator for which the effect varied significantly was additional support by an MHP (MHP-supported EMI, g=0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.88; stand-alone EMI, g=0.45, 95% CI: 0.22-0.69; stand-alone EMI with access to care as usual, g=0.38, 95% CI: 0.11-0.64). In the between-subject studies, 13 studies were included, and a small to medium effect was found (g=0.40, 95% CI: 0.22-0.57). Yet, these between-subject analyses were at risk for publication bias and were not suited for moderator analyses. Furthermore, the overall quality of the studies was relatively low.


Conclusions:
Results showed that there was a small to medium effect of EMIs on mental health and positive psychological well-being and that the effect was not different between outcome types. Moreover, the effect was larger with additional support by an MHP. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to further strengthen the results and to determine potential moderator variables. Overall, EMIs offer great potential for providing easy and cost-effective interventions to improve mental health and increase positive psychological well-being.

A just-in-time, adaptive intervention (JITAI) is an emerging type of intervention that provides tailored support at the exact time of need. It does so using enabling new technologies (e.g., mobile phones, sensors) that capture the changing states of individuals. Extracting effect sizes of primary outcomes produced by 33 empirical studies that used JITAIs, we found moderate to large effect sizes of JITAI treatments compared to (1) waitlist-control conditions (k = 9), Hedges’s g = 1.65 and (2) non-JITAI treatments (k = 21), g = 0.89. Also, participants of JITAI interventions showed significant changes (k = 13) in the positive direction (g = 0.79). A series of sensitivity tests suggested that those effects persist. Those effects also persist despite differences in the behaviors of interests (e.g., blood glucose control, recovering alcoholics), duration of the treatments, and participants’ age. Two aspects of tailoring, namely: (1) tailoring to what (i.e., both people’s previous behavioral patterns and their current need states; with these effects additive) and (2) approach to tailoring (i.e., both using a human agent and an algorithm to decide tailored feedback; with these effects additive), are significantly associated with greater JITAI efficacy.",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liyuan-Wang-8/publication/335656965_Just-in-the-Moment_Adaptive_Interventions_JITAI_A_Meta-Analytical_Review/links/5d7aa96592851c87c37b0fd4/Just-in-the-Moment-Adaptive-Interventions-JITAI-A-Meta-Analytical-Review.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:L72Mif80FvIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.tandfonline.com

Background

Enhancements in mobile phone technology allow the study of children and adolescents' everyday lives like never before. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) uses these advancements to allow in-depth measurements of links between context, behavior, and physiology in youths' everyday lives.

Findings

A large and diverse literature now exists on using EMA to study mental and behavioral health among youth. Modern EMA methods are built on a rich tradition of idiographic inquiry focused on the intensive study of individuals. Studies of child and adolescent mental and behavioral health have used EMA to characterize lived experience, document naturalistic within-person processes and individual differences in these processes, measure familiar constructs in novel ways, and examine temporal order and dynamics in youths' everyday lives.

Conclusions

Ecological momentary assessment is feasible and reliable for studying the daily lives of youth. EMA can inform the development and augmentation of traditional and momentary intervention. Continued research and technological development in mobile intervention design and implementation, EMA-sensor integration, and complex real-time data analysis are needed to realize the potential of just-in-time adaptive intervention, which may allow researchers to reach high-risk youth with intervention content when and where it is needed most.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8428969/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:5arqSAoiVSMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies can capture fluctuations in momentary behavior, and experiences by assessing these multiple times per day. Traditionally, EMA was performed using pen and paper. Recently, due to technological advances EMA studies can be conducted more easily with smartphones, a device ubiquitous in our society. The goal of this review was to evaluate the literature on smartphone-based EMA in well-being research in healthy subjects. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searching PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 53 studies using smartphone-based EMA of well-being. Studies were heterogeneous in designs, context, and measures. The average study duration was 12.8 days, with well-being assessed 2–12 times per day. Half of the studies included objective data (e.g. location). Only 47.2% reported compliance, indicating a mean of 71.6%. Well-being fluctuated daily and weekly, with higher well-being in evenings and weekends. These fluctuations disappeared when location and activity were accounted for. On average, being in nature and physical activity relates to higher well-being. Working relates to lower well-being, but workplace and company do influence well-being. The important advantages of using smartphones instead of other devices to collect EMAs are the easier data collection and flexible designs. Smartphone-based EMA reach far larger maximum sample sizes and more easily add objective data to their designs than palm-top/PDA studies. Smartphone-based EMA research is feasible to gain insight in well-being fluctuations and its determinants and offers the opportunity for parallel objective data collection. Most studies currently focus on group comparisons, while studies on individual differences in well-being patterns and fluctuations are lacking. We provide recommendations for future smartphone-based EMA research regarding measures, objective data and analyses.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-020-00324-7,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:G-Ti0VMyY1cJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Online social media is now omnipresent in many people's daily lives. Much research has been conducted on how and why we use social media, but little is known about the impact of social media abstinence. Therefore, we designed an ecological momentary intervention study using smartphones. Participants were instructed not to use social media for 7 days (4 days baseline, 7 days intervention, and 4 days postintervention; N = 152). We assessed affect (positive and negative), boredom, and craving thrice a day (time-contingent sampling), as well as social media usage frequency, usage duration, and social pressure to be on social media at the end of each day (7,000+ single assessments). We found withdrawal symptoms, such as significantly heightened craving (β = 0.10) and boredom (β = 0.12), as well as reduced positive and negative affect (only descriptively). Social pressure to be on social media was significantly heightened during social media abstinence (β = 0.19) and a substantial number of participants (59 percent) relapsed at least once during the intervention phase. We could not find any substantial rebound effect after the end of the intervention. Taken together, communicating through online social media is evidently such an integral part of everyday life that being without it leads to withdrawal symptoms (craving, boredom), relapses, and social pressure to get back on social media.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:BoJva4IH1e8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.liebertpub.com

In this study, we administered a 28-day self-paced smartphone-delivered intervention rooted in an operant conditioning theoretical framework that targets craving-related eating using mindful eating practices. At pre-intervention and 1-month post-intervention, we assessed food cravings among adult overweight or obese women (N = 104; M age = 46.2 ± 14.1 years; M BMI = 31.5 ± 4.5) using ecological momentary assessment via text message (SMS), self-reported eating behavior (e.g., trait food craving), and in-person weight. Seventy-eight participants (75.0%) completed the intervention within 7 months (‘all completers’), and of these, 64 completed the intervention within 3 months (‘timely completers’). Participants experienced significant reductions in craving-related eating (40.21% reduction; p < .001) and self-reported overeating behavior (trait food craving, p < .001; other measures ps < .01).

Taken together, results suggest that smartphone-delivered mindful eating training targeting craving-related eating may (1) target behavior that impacts a relative metabolic pathway, and (2) represent a low-burden and highly disseminable method to reduce problematic overeating among overweight individuals.

Background:
Despite substantial public health progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the United States overall, smoking among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults remains high.


Objective:
To determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a novel smartphone-based smoking cessation app designed for socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.


Methods:
Participants were recruited from a safety-net hospital smoking cessation clinic in Dallas, Texas, and were followed for 13 weeks. All participants received standard smoking cessation clinic care (ie, group counseling and cessation pharmacotherapy) and a smartphone with a novel smoking cessation app (ie, Smart-T). The Smart-T app prompted 5 daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for 3 weeks (ie, 1 week before cessation and 2 weeks after cessation). During the precessation period, EMAs were followed by messages that focused on planning and preparing for the quit attempt. During the postcessation period, participant responses to EMAs drove an algorithm that tailored messages to the current level of smoking lapse risk and currently present lapse triggers (eg, urge to smoke, stress). Smart-T offered additional intervention features on demand (eg, one-click access to the tobacco cessation quitline; “Quit Tips” on coping with urges to smoke, mood, and stress).


Results:
Participants (N=59) were 52.0 (SD 7.0) years old, 54% (32/59) female, and 53% (31/59) African American, and 70% (40/57) had annual household income less than US $16,000. Participants smoked 20.3 (SD 11.6) cigarettes per day and had been smoking for 31.6 (SD 10.9) years. Twelve weeks after the scheduled quit date, 20% (12/59) of all participants were biochemically confirmed abstinent. Participants responded to 87% of all prompted EMAs and received approximately 102 treatment messages over the 3-week EMA period. Most participants (83%, 49/59) used the on-demand app features. Individuals with greater nicotine dependence and minority race used the Quit Tips feature more than their counterparts. Greater use of the Quit Tips feature was linked to nonabstinence at the 2 (P=.02), 4 (P<.01), and 12 (P=.03) week follow-up visits. Most participants reported that they actually used or implemented the tailored app-generated messages and suggestions (83%, 49/59); the app-generated messages were helpful (97%, 57/59); they would like to use the app in the future if they were to lapse (97%, 57/59); and they would like to refer friends who smoke to use the Smart-T app (85%, 50/59). A minority of participants (15%, 9/59) reported that the number of daily assessments (ie, 5) was “too high.”


Conclusions:
This novel just-in-time adaptive intervention delivered an intensive intervention (ie, 102 messages over a 3-week period), was well-liked, and was perceived as helpful and useful by socioeconomically disadvantaged adults who were seeking smoking cessation treatment. Smartphone apps may be used to increase treatment exposure and may ultimately reduce tobacco-related health disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults.

The development of mobile computing technology has enabled the delivery of psychological interventions while people go about their everyday lives. The original visions of the potential of these “ecological momentary interventions” were presented over a decade ago, and the widespread adoption of smartphones in the intervening years has led to a variety of research studies exploring the feasibility of these aspirations. However, there is a dearth of research describing the different dimensions, characteristics, and features of these interventions, as constructed.

Objective

To provide an overview of the definitions given for “ecological momentary interventions” in the treatment of common mental health disorders, and describe the set of technological and interaction possibilities which have been used in the design of these interventions.

Methods

A systematic search identified relevant literature published between 2009 and 2020 in the PubMed, PsycInfo, and ACM Guide to the Computing Literature databases. Following screening, data were extracted from eligible articles using a standardized extraction worksheet. Selected articles were then thematically categorized.

Results

The search identified 583 articles of which 64 met the inclusion criteria. The interventions target a range of mental health problems, with diverse aims, intervention designs and evaluation approaches. The studies employed a variety of features for intervention delivery, but recent research is overwhelmingly comprised of studies based on smartphone apps (30 of 42 papers that described an intervention). Twenty two studies employed sensors for the collection of data in order to provide just-in-time support or predict psychological states.

Conclusions

With the shift towards smartphone apps, the vision for EMIs has begun to be realised. Recent years have seen increased exploration of the use of sensors and machine learning, but the role of humans in the delivery of EMI is also varied. The variety of capabilities exhibited by EMIs motivates development of a more precise vocabulary for capturing both automatic and human tailoring of these interventions.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248152,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:AA-KEV03KKQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",journals.plos.org

Most striking, it was shown that individual findings are different from what is found on overall group levels. Some people stay anxious after a paranoid thought came to mind.

This review aims to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of EMI for treating anxiety conditions.

Materials and Methods Four databases and the reference lists of previous studies were searched. A total of 1949 abstracts were double screened for inclusion. Sufficient studies were available to undertake a quantitative meta-analysis on EMIs on generalized anxiety symptoms.

Results The 15 randomized trials and randomized controlled trials examined anxiety ( n = 7), stress ( n = 3), anxiety and stress ( n = 2), panic disorder ( n = 2), and social phobia ( n = 1). Eight EMIs comprised self-monitoring integrated with therapy modules, seven comprised multimedia content, and three comprised self-monitoring only. The quality of studies presented high risk of biases. Meta-analysis ( n = 7) demonstrated that EMIs reduced generalized anxiety compared to control and/or comparison groups (Effect Size (ES) = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.12-0.53). Most EMIs targeting stress were reported effective relative to control as were the two EMIs targeting panic disorders. The EMI targeting social phobia was not effective.

Discussion EMIs have potential in treating both anxiety and stress. However, few high-quality trials have been conducted for specific anxiety disorders. Further trials are needed to assess the value of EMI technologies for anxiety in enhancing existing treatments.

Conclusion This study found a small significant effect of EMI studies on reducing generalized anxiety.

Virtues, broadly understood as stable and robust dispositions for certain responses across morally relevant situations, have been a growing topic of interest in psychology. A central topic of discussion has been whether studies showing that situations can strongly influence our responses provide evidence against the existence of virtues (as a kind of stable and robust disposition). In this review, we examine reasons for thinking that the prevailing methods for examining situational influences are limited in their ability to test dispositional stability and robustness; or, then, whether virtues exist. We make the case that these limitations can be addressed by aggregating repeated, cross-situational assessments of environmental, psychological and physiological variables within everyday life—a form of assessment often called ecological momentary assessment (EMA, or experience sampling). We, then, examine how advances in smartphone application (app) technology, and their mass adoption, make these mobile devices an unprecedented vehicle for EMA and, thus, the psychological study of virtue. We, additionally, examine how smartphones might be used for virtue development by promoting changes in thought and behavior within daily life; a technique often called ecological momentary intervention (EMI). While EMA/I have become widely employed since the 1980s for the purposes of understanding and promoting change amongst clinical populations, few EMA/I studies have been devoted to understanding or promoting virtues within non-clinical populations. Further, most EMA/I studies have relied on journaling, PDAs, phone calls and/or text messaging systems. We explore how smartphone app technology provides a means of making EMA a more robust psychological method, EMI a more robust way of promoting positive change, and, as a result, opens up new possibilities for studying and promoting virtues.

A number of methodological challenges remain in evaluating specificity of potential causal links between a given psychological mechanism and psychosis outcomes in a systematic fashion, capitalizing on longitudinal data to investigate temporal ordering. In this article, we argue for testing ecological interventionist causal models that draw on real world and real-time delivered, ecological momentary interventions for generating evidence on several causal criteria (association, time order, and direction/sole plausibility) under real-world conditions, while maximizing generalizability to social contexts and experiences in heterogeneous populations. Specifically, this approach tests whether ecological momentary interventions can (1) modify a putative mechanism and (2) produce changes in the mechanism that lead to sustainable changes in intended psychosis outcomes in individuals’ daily lives. Future research using this approach will provide translational evidence on the active ingredients of mobile health and in-person interventions that promote sustained effectiveness of ecological momentary interventions and, thereby, contribute to ongoing efforts that seek to enhance effectiveness of psychological interventions under real-world conditions.",https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/42/2/264/2518965,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:JABTDLc4UU0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",academic.oup.com

Orientation Week is a series of events at the beginning of the university year that introduces incoming students to university life. It is also the period of the academic year when students consume more alcohol than at any other time. Recently, we demonstrated that alcohol consumption during Orientation Week was related to alcohol consumption during the academic year. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a brief Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) implemented during Orientation Week could reduce alcohol consumption during Orientation Week and throughout the academic year.

Method:

Participants were 130 freshman-year university students (72 women, 58 men) randomly assigned to either an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) condition or an EMA-EMI condition. In both conditions, participants reported pre-university, Orientation Week, and academic year weekend alcohol consumption. Those in the EMA-EMI condition also received EMI text messages promoting moderation every night during Orientation Week.

Results:

Although the EMI did not reduce men’s drinking, women in the EMA-EMI condition, compared with women in the EMA condition, consumed significantly fewer drinks during Orientation Week, M = 17.1, SD = 13.3, vs. M = 26.4, SD = 22.5, respectively, t(70) = -1.927, p < .05, Cohen’s d = 0.473, and reported consuming fewer weekend drinks during the academic semester, M = 5.0, SD = 3.3, vs. M = 7.5, SD = 6.3, respectively, t(70) = -2.263, p < .05, d = 0.451.

Despite efficacious pharmacological and behavioral treatments, most smokers attempt to quit without assistance and fail to quit. Mindfulness practice may be useful in smoking cessation.

Methods:

This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study was a pilot parallel group randomized controlled trial of a brief mindfulness practice (Brief-MP) intervention on self-reported smoking behavior delivered to smokers on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) in the field. Adult community smokers ( N = 44) were randomly assigned to a Brief-MP ( n = 24) or Control (sham meditation; n = 20) group. Participants were instructed to smoke as much or as little as they liked. Participants carried a PDA for 2 weeks and were instructed to initiate 20 minutes of meditation (or control) training on the PDA daily, completing an assessment of cognitive and affective processes immediately afterwards. Additionally, they completed assessments at random times up to four times per day. Primary outcome variables were negative affect, craving, and cigarettes smoked per day, all self-reported.

Results:

Thirty-seven participants provided EMA data totaling 1874 assessments. Linear Mixed Model analyses on EMA data revealed that Brief-MP (vs. Control) reduced overall negative affect, F (1, 1798) = 13.8, P = .0002; reduced craving immediately post-meditation, (Group × Assessment Type interaction, F (2, 1796) = 12.3, P = .0001); and reduced cigarettes smoked per day over time (Group × Day interaction, F (1, 436) = 5.50, P = .01).

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a recently introduced approach to patient evaluation that consists of asking patients questions in real time and in their usual habitat. This method seeks to contribute to suicide prevention by providing psychiatrists with detailed information about suicidal thoughts and behavior, how these fluctuate over short periods of time, and the short-term risk factors presented by patients. We conducted a systematic review of published research using EMA to study suicidal thoughts and behavior.

Recent Findings

Several systematic reviews of EMA in mental health have been conducted to date, and the literature contains numerous theoretical papers and compilations on EMA and suicide phenomena. To date, however, no systematic reviews have explored the use of this tool to study suicidal thoughts and behavior.

Summary

We performed a systematic review of five databases (i.e., PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) to identify studies on EMA and suicidal thoughts and behavior. An initial search revealed 544 articles. Following the study selection process, 35 studies were included in the review. Almost three-quarters of the studies were published in the last 4 years. The studies reviewed concluded that EMA was generally feasible and well accepted. EMA findings correlated well with the results of a retrospective assessment, though tended to over-represent symptom severity. Our review points to important aspects of suicidal thoughts and behavior, such as its wide fluctuation over short periods of time. Negative affect and disturbed sleep, among others, emerged as short-term predictors of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Therefore, EMA is a potentially useful tool in clinical practice, although not without drawbacks, such as participant fatigue with questionnaires and ethical concerns.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:oIj29a5t9aQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a way of collecting data in people’s natural environments in real time and has become very popular in social and health sciences. The emergence of personal digital assistants has led to more complex and sophisticated EMA protocols but has also highlighted some important drawbacks. Modern cell phones combine the functionalities of advanced communication systems with those of a handheld computer and offer various additional features to capture and record sound, pictures, locations, and movements. Moreover, most people own a cell phone, are familiar with the different functions, and always carry it with them. This paper describes ways in which cell phones have been used for data collection purposes in the field of social sciences. This includes automated data capture techniques, for example, geolocation for the study of mobility patterns and the use of external sensors for remote health-monitoring research.

Abstract

Abstract. Rapid advances in mobile data-transfer technologies offer new possibilities in the use of cell phones to conduct assessments of a person’s natural environment in real time. This paper describes features of a new Internet-based, cell phone-optimized assessment technique (ICAT), which consists of a retrospective baseline assessment combined with text messages sent to the participants’ personal cell phones providing a hyperlink to an Internet-stored cell phone-optimized questionnaire. Two participation conditions were used to test variations in response burden. Retention rates, completion rates, and response times in different subgroups were tested by means of χ² tests, Cox regression, and logistic regression. Among the 237 initial participants, we observed a retention rate of 90.3% from the baseline assessment to the cell-phone part, and 80.4% repeated participation in the 30 daily assessments. Each day, 40–70% of the questionnaires were returned, a fourth in less than 3 minutes. Qualitative interviews underscored the ease of use of ICAT. This technique appears to be an innovative, convenient, and cost-effective way of collecting data on situational characteristics while minimizing recall bias. Because of its flexibility, ICAT can be applied in various disciplines, whether as part of small pilot studies or large-scale, crosscultural, and multisite research projects.

Abstract
Introduction

Daily assessment studies have examined how day specific factors, such as affect, social context, and drinking motives, alongside dispositional drinking motives, predict young adults' drinking. However, these studies did not examine how the interplay between drinking motives (dispositional and day specific) and multiple features of the drinking situation predict drinking with respect to either the initial decision to drink or the quantity of alcohol consumed. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) via smartphone technology, enables us to address this gap by evaluating to what extent dispositional drinking motives and day specific factors are associated with: a) the initiation of drinking episodes and; b) the quantity of alcohol consumed.

Methods

Participants were 83 young adults (63 female) aged 18 to 30 (M = 21.42, SD = 3.09) who resided in Australia and participated in an EMA study for 21 days via their smartphone. On a daily basis, participants received three random-interval prompts that measured momentary affect, drinking motives, social context (e.g., people present in the social context and if these individuals are drinking), and alcohol use.

Results

A multilevel hurdle analysis found that young adults were more likely to both initiate a drinking episode and consume a higher quantity of alcohol if they were surrounded by other people who were drinking and were motivated to drink to conform to the reference group.

Conclusions

This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that different drinking behaviors (i.e., initiation and quantity of alcohol consumed) are associated with a similar set of predictors. Drinking-based interventions that address these risk factors could effectively reduce risky drinking as it would intervene on both the decision to initiate alcohol use, and the decision to continue drinking.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:6KB5TixQJaAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract
We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a 2-week-long ecological momentary intervention (EMI), delivered via personal digital assistants (PDAs), to improve treatment adherence in bipolar disorder. EMIs use mobile technology to deliver treatment as clients engage in their typical daily routines, in their usual settings. Overall, participants (N = 14) stated that EMI sessions were helpful, user-friendly, and engaging, and reported satisfaction with the timing and burden of sessions, as well as the method of delivery. All participants completed the study, and all PDAs were returned undamaged. On average, participants completed 92% of EMI sessions. Although this study was not designed to assess efficacy, depression scores decreased significantly over the study period and data suggest relatively high rates of treatment adherence; missed medication was reported 3% of the time and three participants reported missing a total of six mental health appointments. Negative feedback largely involved technical and logistical issues, many of which are easily addressable. These preliminary findings add to the growing body of literature indicating that mobile-technology-assisted interventions are feasible to implement and acceptable to patients with serious mental illnesses.

Background: Awake bruxism (AB) is an oral condition that has some uncertainties concerning the epidemiology, also due to the different diagnostic strategies that have been adopted to address it in the research setting. The recent new definition of AB suggests that an ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which enables real-time reporting of the condition under study, can implement knowledge on the topic.

Objectives: This article will discuss the general principles of EMA and EMI (Ecological Momentary Intervention) and comment on a preliminary dataset gathered with a smartphone application in a population of Italian young adults.

Materials and Methods: A dedicated smartphone application has been used (BruxApp®) on a sample of 30 University students (mean age 24 ± 3.5 years) to record real time report on five specific oral conditions (relaxed jaw muscles, tooth contact, teeth clenching, teeth grinding, mandible bracing) that are related with the spectrum of AB activities. Data were recorded over a 7-day period for two times, with a 1-month interval between the two observation periods. The purpose of collecting data over a second week, 1-month later, was to monitor AB behaviors over time, and test for potential “EMI” effects.

Results: Over the first 7 days (T1), the average frequency of relaxed jaw muscles reports at the population level was 62%. Teeth contact (20%) and mandible bracing (14%) were the most frequent AB behaviors. No significant gender differences were detected. One month later, during the second week of data collection (T2), the frequency of the conditions was as follows: relaxed jaw muscles 74%, teeth contact 11% and mandible bracing 13%.

Conclusions: These data recorded do not allow any generalization due the unrepresentativeness of the study population. On the other hand, they can be used as templates for future comparisons to get deeper into the study of natural fluctuations of AB behaviors as well as into the potential biofeedback effect of an ecological momentary assessment/intervention. It is important to recognize that the use of smartphone technology may help to set range of values for AB frequency in otherwise healthy individuals, in order to stand as comparisons for selected populations with risk or associated factors.

Background:
Smartphone apps for smoking cessation could offer easily accessible, highly tailored, intensive interventions at a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling. Although there are hundreds of publicly available smoking cessation apps, few have been empirically evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The Smart-Treatment (Smart-T2) app is a just-in-time adaptive intervention that uses ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to assess the risk for imminent smoking lapse and tailors treatment messages based on the risk of lapse and reported symptoms.


Objective:
This 3-armed pilot RCT aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an automated smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention (Smart-T2) relative to standard in-person smoking cessation clinic care and the National Cancer Institute’s free smoking cessation app, QuitGuide.


Methods:
Adult smokers who attended a clinic-based tobacco cessation program were randomized into groups and followed for 13 weeks (1 week prequitting through 12 weeks postquitting). All study participants received nicotine patches and gum and were asked to complete EMAs five times a day on study-provided smartphones for 5 weeks. Participants in the Smart-T2 group received tailored treatment messages after the completion of each EMA. Both Smart-T2 and QuitGuide apps offer on-demand smoking cessation treatment.


Results:
Of 81 participants, 41 (50%) were women and 55 (68%) were white. On average, participants were aged 49.6 years and smoked 22.4 cigarettes per day at baseline. A total of 17% (14/81) of participants were biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinent at 12 weeks postquitting (Smart-T2: 6/27, 22%, QuitGuide: 4/27, 15%, and usual care: 4/27, 15%), with no significant differences across groups (P>.05). Participants in the Smart-T2 group rated the app positively, with most participants agreeing that they can rely on the app to help them quit smoking, and endorsed the belief that the app would help them stay quit, and these responses were not significantly different from the ratings given by participants in the usual care group.


Conclusions:
Dynamic smartphone apps that tailor intervention content in real time may increase user engagement and exposure to treatment-related materials. The results of this pilot RCT suggest that smartphone-based smoking cessation treatments may be capable of providing similar outcomes to traditional, in-person counseling.

Bariatric surgery is the most effective means of long-term weight loss. Knowledge gaps and lack of engagement in pre-operative patients can result in suboptimal outcome after surgery. Mobile technology, utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA)/intervention (EMI), has shown tremendous promise in changing behaviors. The primary objective of the study is to assess feasibility of using smartphone app with EMA/EMI functionality to prepare patients for bariatric surgery.

Methods

Subjects seeking primary bariatric surgery were provided a smartphone app containing video-based education modules with linked assessments to evaluate mastery of topic. Subjects received algorithmic EMA text messages soliciting a response regarding lifestyle behavior. Upon answering, subjects received tailored EMI text messaging supporting healthy lifestyle.

Results

Thirty subjects (27 female and 3 male), with age of 41.3 ± 11.4 years and BMI of 46.3 ± 7.4 kg/m2 were enrolled. Twenty subjects completed the study. Ten subjects withdrew. On average, seven out of nine education modules were completed (70.9 ± 27.3 %), and 37.8/123 EMA were answered (30.7 ± 21.7 %), with response time of 17.4 ± 4.4 min. Subjects reported high satisfaction with the app. Many felt that the app fit into their routine “somewhat easily” or “very easily” (n = 12), had “perfect” amount of EMA messages (n = 8), and was very helpful in preparing for surgery (n = 7).

Conclusions

This study is the first to reveal the feasibility of using a smartphone app in the education and engagement of patients prior to bariatric surgery. The app was well-received based on subject satisfaction scores and revealed trends toward positive behavior change and increased weight loss.

Abstract

The ability to capture real-time data on human behavior inexpensively, efficiently, and accurately holds promise to transform and broaden our understanding of many areas of health science. One approach to acquiring this type of real-time data is ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This method has been used to collect data in many domains of addiction research, including research on the treatment of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that use of EMA can improve the quality of AUD treatment research when compared with standard assessment methods because it provides more accurate reporting, allows investigators to examine the dynamic unfolding of the behavior change process at an individual level, and can be used to augment and improve clinical assessment and treatment. Overall, the existing literature provides strong support for the advantages of EMA when combined with standard assessment of addictive behaviors in general. Nevertheless, use of EMA in AUD treatment research thus far has been limited, especially in the area of research on mechanisms of behavior change. Existing research indicates, however, that EMA can be used to deliver tailored feedback as a novel and potentially transformative approach to improving AUD treatment. This research area clearly warrants additional future efforts.

Background:
Alcohol use is a risk factor for the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among African American men who have sex with men (MSM). Mobile phone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA) could minimize bias due to retrospective recall and thus provide a better understanding of the social and structural context of alcohol use and its relationship with HIV-related risk behaviors in this population as well as other highly stigmatized populations.


Objective:
We describe the study design and the implementation, feasibility, reactivity, and acceptability of an EMA study of alcohol use and HIV-related behaviors among African American MSM in Baltimore.


Methods:
Participants were recruited through flyers and word-of-mouth in Baltimore from September 2013 to November 2014. Each participant was loaned an Android smartphone and instructed to respond to multiple prompts from the mobile app for 4 weeks. Data were collected through (1) random prompts delivered three times daily assessing participants’ location, activity, mood, and social context, (2) daily prompts capturing drinking and sex events occurring in the past 24 hours, and (3) event-contingent responses collecting participants’ self-reported episodes of drinking.


Results:
A total of 16 participants enrolled in the study. The current analyses focused on 15 participants who completed at least 24 days of follow-up (mean follow-up time 29 days; range 24-35 days). Study participants (N=15) were a median 38 years of age (range 27-62 years) with low levels of income and educational attainment. Ten individuals self-reported living with HIV/AIDS, over half reported drinking alcohol at least 2-3 times a week, and a third reported binge drinking (ie, 6 or more drinks on one occasion) on a weekly basis. Based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score, nearly half were classified as hazardous drinkers (score 8-15) and a fifth were likely dependent (score ≥16). A total of 140 participant-initiated events were reported, and 75% of 1308 random prompts and 81% of 436 daily prompts delivered were answered. Of seven devices used during the study, five were reported lost by participants. We did not observe strong reactivity effects, and self-reported acceptability to study procedures was uniformly favorable.


Conclusions:
This study provides evidence to support the feasibility and acceptability of using EMA methods for collecting data on alcohol use among African American men who have sex with men living in urban settings. These data provide the basis for future studies of EMA-informed mHealth interventions to promote the reduction of substance use and HIV risk-taking behaviors among African American MSM living in urban settings.

Background:
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has utility for measuring psychological properties in daily life. EMA has also allowed researchers to collect data on diverse experiences and symptoms from various subjects.


Objective:
The aim of this study was to review methodological strategies and useful related information for EMA using mobile phones to capture changes of mood and stress in adult patients seeking health care.


Methods:
We searched PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. This review included studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English between January 2008 and November 2017 that used basic- or advanced-feature mobile phones to measure momentary mood or stress in adult patients seeking health care in outpatient departments. We excluded studies of smoking and substance addictions and studies of mental disorder patients who had been diagnosed by physicians.

We reviewed 12 selected articles that used EMA via mobile phones to measure momentary mood and stress and other related variables from various patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, breast cancer, migraine, HIV, tinnitus, temporomandibular disorder, end-stage kidney disease, and traumatic brain injury. Most of the selected studies (11/12, 92%) used signal contingency and in 8 of the 12 studies (67%) alarms were sent at random or semirandom intervals to prompt the momentary measurement. Out of 12 studies, 7 (58%) used specific apps directly installed on mobile phones, 3 (25%) used mobile phones to link to Web-based survey programs, and 2 (17%) used an interactive voice-response system.


Conclusions:
This study provides researchers with useful information regarding methodological details for utilizing EMA to measure mood and stress in adult patients. This review shows that EMA methods could be effective and reasonable for measuring momentary mood and stress, given that basic- and advanced-feature mobile phones are ubiquitous, familiar, and easy to approach. Therefore, researchers could adopt and utilize EMA methods using mobile phones to measure psychological health outcomes, such as mood and stress, in adult patients.

Abstract
Background

Smartphone apps can provide real-time, tailored interventions for smoking cessation. The current study examines the effectiveness of a smartphone-based smoking cessation application that assessed risk for imminent smoking lapse multiple times per day and provided messages tailored to current smoking lapse risk and specific lapse triggers.

Methods

Participants (N = 59) recruited from a safety-net hospital smoking cessation clinic completed phone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) 5 times/day for 3 consecutive weeks (1 week pre-quit, 2 weeks post-quit). Risk for smoking lapse was estimated in real-time using a novel weighted lapse risk estimator. With each EMA, participants received messages tailored to current level of risk for imminent smoking lapse and self-reported presence of smoking urge, stress, cigarette availability, and motivation to quit. Generalized linear mixed model analyses determined whether messages tailored to specific lapse risk factors were associated with greater reductions in these triggers than messages not tailored to specific triggers.

Results

Overall, messages tailored to smoking urge, cigarette availability, or stress corresponded with greater reductions in those triggers than messages that were not tailored to specific triggers (p's = 0.02 to < 0.001). Although messages tailored to stress were associated with greater reductions in stress than messages not tailored to stress, the association was non-significant (p = 0.892) when only moments of high stress were included in the analysis.

Conclusions

Mobile technology can be used to conduct real-time smoking lapse risk assessment and provide tailored treatment content.

Abstract

Real-time assessment, known as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and real-time intervention (ecological momentary intervention [EMI]) can significantly extend the reach and impact of interventions to help individuals reduce their drinking behavior. For EMA, the user provides information on the variable of interest (e.g., drinking or craving) via a mobile device. This data reporting can occur either at pre-specified times or in certain high-risk situations. The primary benefits of EMA include external validity, minimized recall bias, and the ability to capture dynamic patterns in human behavior. EMI refers to interventions that are delivered via mobile devices at the time when the user needs it (i.e., in a high-risk situation). Key constructs of EMI are what interventions are delivered and when they are delivered. The timing of the EMI often is determined by the user’s EMA reports. Both EMA and EMI have been studied in people with alcohol use disorders. EMA and EMI often are used in conjunction with each other because EMA can help inform the optimal timing of EMI and help tailor its content. Further development of high-impact, algorithm-driven, technology-mediated real-time intervention may help reduce drinking and promote positive health behavior change.

Background:
Mobile ecological momentary assessment (mEMA) permits real-time capture of self-reported participant behaviors and perceptual experiences. Reporting of mEMA protocols and compliance has been identified as problematic within systematic reviews of children, youth, and specific clinical populations of adults.


Objective:
This study aimed to describe the use of mEMA for self-reported behaviors and psychological constructs, mEMA protocol and compliance reporting, and associations between key components of mEMA protocols and compliance in studies of nonclinical and clinical samples of adults.


Methods:
In total, 9 electronic databases were searched (2006-2016) for observational studies reporting compliance to mEMA for health-related data from adults (>18 years) in nonclinical and clinical settings. Screening and data extraction were undertaken by independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Narrative synthesis described participants, mEMA target, protocol, and compliance. Random effects meta-analysis explored factors associated with cohort compliance (monitoring duration, daily prompt frequency or schedule, device type, training, incentives, and burden score). Random effects analysis of variance (P≤.05) assessed differences between nonclinical and clinical data sets.


Results:
Of the 168 eligible studies, 97/105 (57.7%) reported compliance in unique data sets (nonclinical=64/105 [61%], clinical=41/105 [39%]). The most common self-reported mEMA target was affect (primary target: 31/105, 29.5% data sets; secondary target: 50/105, 47.6% data sets). The median duration of the mEMA protocol was 7 days (nonclinical=7, clinical=12). Most protocols used a single time-based (random or interval) prompt type (69/105, 65.7%); median prompt frequency was 5 per day. The median number of items per prompt was similar for nonclinical (8) and clinical data sets (10). More than half of the data sets reported mEMA training (84/105, 80%) and provision of participant incentives (66/105, 62.9%). Less than half of the data sets reported number of prompts delivered (22/105, 21%), answered (43/105, 41%), criterion for valid mEMA data (37/105, 35.2%), or response latency (38/105, 36.2%). Meta-analysis (nonclinical=41, clinical=27) estimated an overall compliance of 81.9% (95% CI 79.1-84.4), with no significant difference between nonclinical and clinical data sets or estimates before or after data exclusions. Compliance was associated with prompts per day and items per prompt for nonclinical data sets. Although widespread heterogeneity existed across analysis (I2>90%), no compelling relationship was identified between key features of mEMA protocols representing burden and mEMA compliance.


Conclusions:
In this 10-year sample of studies using the mEMA of self-reported health-related behaviors and psychological constructs in adult nonclinical and clinical populations, mEMA was applied across contexts and health conditions and to collect a range of health-related data. There was inconsistent reporting of compliance and key features within protocols, which limited the ability to confidently identify components of mEMA schedules likely to have a specific impact on compliance.

Abstract
Background

Connected interventions use data collected through mobile/wearable devices to trigger real-time interventions and have great potential to improve treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). This review aims to describe the current landscape, effectiveness and usability of connected interventions for SUD.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to identify articles evaluating connected health interventions for SUD in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Three databases (PubMed, IEEE, and Scopus) were searched over a five-year period. Included articles described a connected health intervention targeting SUD and provided outcomes data. Data were extracted using a standardized reporting tool.

Results

A total of 1676 unique articles were identified during the initial search, with 32 articles included in the final analysis. Seven articles of the 32 were derived from two large studies. The most commonly studied SUD was alcohol use disorder. Sixteen articles reported at least one statistically significant result with respect to reduced craving and/or substance use. The majority of articles used ecological momentary assessment to trigger interventions, while four used biologic/physiologic data. Two articles used a wearable device. Common intervention types included craving management, coping assistance, and tailored feedback. Twenty-three articles measured usability factors, and acceptability was generally reported as high.

This article reviews the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) in clinical research applications. EMA refers to a method of data collection that attempts to capture respondents’ activities, emotions, and thoughts in the moment, in their natural environment. It typically uses prompts administered through a personal electronic device, such as a smartphone or tablet. EMI extends this technique and includes the use of microlevel interventions administered through personal electronic devices. These technological developments hold promise for enhancing psychological treatments by prompting the patient outside of therapy sessions in his or her day-to-day environment. Research suggests that EMI may be beneficial to participants and that this effect is amplified when EMI is delivered in the context of ongoing psychotherapy. EMI may reflect a cost-effective mechanism to enhance therapeutic outcomes.",https://focus.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.focus.20180017,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Cc4M0DxecDMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",focus.psychiatryonline.org

In the last decades, emotion regulation (ER) received increasing attention and became one of the most studied topics within the psychological field. Nevertheless, this construct has not been fully updated with the latest technological advancements. In this perspective, we will show how diverse technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), wearable biosensors, smartphones, or biofeedback techniques, can be applied to the understanding, assessment, and intervention of ER.

Abstract
The ability to regulate emotions in response to stress is central to healthy development. Whereas early research in emotion regulation predominantly employed static, self-report measurement, the past decade has seen a shift in focus toward understanding the dynamic nature of regulation processes. This is reflected in recent refinements in the definition of emotion regulation that emphasize the importance of the ability to flexibly adapt regulation efforts across contexts. The latest proliferation of digital technologies employed in mental health research offers the opportunity to capture the state- and context-sensitive nature of emotion regulation. In this conceptual review, we examine the use of digital technologies (ecological momentary assessment; wearable and smartphone technology, physical activity, acoustic data, visual data, and geo-location; smart-home technology; virtual reality; social media) in the assessment of emotion regulation and describe their application to interventions. We also discuss challenges and ethical considerations and outline areas for future research.

ABSTRACT

The current article describes the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Daily Life (ACT-DL) training, a new mobile health treatment protocol for ACT applied in a randomized controlled trial in early psychosis individuals. Between weekly ACT therapy sessions, patients fill out brief questionnaires on an app about their mood, symptoms, activity, and current context, thus promoting awareness - a crucial component of ACT. The app also provides them with visual cues and exercises specifically related to the ACT sessions, to help them implement the techniques previously learned in therapy into their daily lives. Here we assess the feasibility of this protocol in 16 early psychosis individuals, as part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Specifically, we investigate the experienced usefulness of the ACT therapy and app, and burden of the protocol. Results indicate that participants find both the therapy sessions and the app useful, and that ACT-DL guides them in putting ACT into everyday practice, although the protocol may be moderately burdensome. These findings indicate that ACT-DL may help early psychosis patients applying ACT skills to diverse contexts of everyday life. Since ACT is not symptom-specific, ACT-DL may also be suited for different target populations. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

Ambulatory assessment methods, including ecological momentary assessment (EMA), have often been used in eating disorders (EDs) to assess the type, frequency, and temporal sequencing of ED symptoms occurring in naturalistic environments. Relatedly, growing research in EDs has explored the utility of ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) to target ED symptoms. The aims of the present review were to (1) synthesize recent literature pertaining to ambulatory assessment/EMA and EMI in EDs, and (2) identify relevant limitations and future directions in these domains.

Recent Findings

With respect to ambulatory assessment and EMA, there has been substantial growth in the expansion of constructs assessed with EMA, the exploration of state- vs. trait-level processes, integration of objective and passive assessment approaches, and consideration of methodological issues. The EMI literature in EDs also continues to grow, though most of the recent research focuses on mobile health (mHealth) technologies with relatively minimal EMI components that adapt to momentary contextual information.

Summary

Despite these encouraging advances, there remain several promising areas of ambulatory assessment research and clinical applications in EDs going forward. These include integration of passive data collection, use of EMA in treatment evaluation and design, evaluation of dynamic system processes, inclusion of diverse samples, and development and evaluation of adaptive, tailored EMIs such as just-in-time adaptive interventions. While much remains to be learned in each of these domains, the continual growth in mobile technology has potential to facilitate and refine our understanding of the nature of ED psychopathology and ultimately improve intervention approaches.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:gQueLj1Hp0QJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Addiction is a serious and prevalent problem across the globe. An important challenge facing intervention science is how to support addiction treatment and recovery while mitigating the associated cost and stigma. A promising solution is the use of mobile health (mHealth) just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in which intervention options are delivered in situ via a mobile device when individuals are most in need.

Recent Findings

The present review describes the use of mHealth JITAIs to support addiction treatment and recovery, and provides guidance on when and how the micro-randomized trial (MRT) can be used to optimize a JITAI. We describe the design of five mHealth JITAIs in addiction and three MRT studies, and discuss challenges and future directions.

•

Professor Cash encouraged greater scholarship into the context-dependence of body image.

•

Literature has since explored the frequency and correlates of both positive and negative body image.

•

The moderating influence of trait body image on state-based relationships remain unclear.

•

State body image of males, clinical populations, and those with disability remain under-explored.

•

Methodological and empirical bases for building on Cash’s foundational work in this field are provided.

Abstract

This review highlights the contributions of Professor Thomas Cash to the scholarship of body image experiences in daily life, including his influence on subsequent research in this field. Cash’s arguments for capturing a broad range of state-based body image experiences have been heeded, with recent studies exploring positive body image constructs as well as the more studied negative body image experiences. Appearance comparisons are the most commonly studied contextual influence on body image, and they seem to have a consistent effect. However, the experiences of body image in sexual contexts, and among adolescents, those who are pregnant, or have other physical characteristics that may increase the salience of appearance warrant further attention. Findings generally support Cash’s contention that trait body image relates to likelihood and level of experience of body image in daily life, though the moderating effects of trait aspects on state-based relationships remains unclear.

Background:
Real-time ecological momentary interventions have shown promising effects in domains other than alcohol use; however, only few studies regarding ecological momentary interventions for alcohol use have been conducted thus far. The increasing popularity of smartphones offers new avenues for intervention and innovation in data collection.


Objective:
We aimed to test the efficacy of an ecological momentary intervention, comprising mobile Web-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and text messaging (short message service, SMS) brief interventions, delivered during drinking events using participants’ mobile phones.


Methods:
We conducted a three-armed randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of a mobile Web-based ecological momentary assessment with texting feedback on self-reported alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms in young adults. Participants were enrolled from an existing observational cohort study of young adults screened for risky drinking behavior. The intervention group (ecological momentary intervention group) completed repeated ecological momentary assessments during 6 drinking events and received immediate texting-based feedback in response to each ecological momentary assessment. The second group (ecological momentary assessment group) completed ecological momentary assessments without the brief intervention, and the third did not receive any contact during the trial period. Recent peak risky single-occasion drinking was assessed at the baseline and follow-up using telephone interviews. We used a random effects mixed modeling approach using maximum likelihood estimation to provide estimates of differences in mean drinking levels between groups between baseline and 12-week follow-up.


Results:
A total of 269 participants were randomized into the 3 groups. The ecological momentary intervention group exhibited a small and nonsignificant increase between baseline and follow-up in (geometric) the mean number of standard drinks consumed at the most recent heavy drinking occasion (mean 12.5 vs 12.7). Both ecological momentary assessment and control groups exhibited a nonsignificant decrease (ecological momentary assessment: mean 13.8 vs 11.8; control: mean 12.3 vs 11.6); these changes did not differ significantly between groups (Wald χ22 1.6; P=.437) and the magnitude of the effects of the intervention were markedly small. No other significant differences between groups on measures of alcohol consumption or related harms were observed. The intervention acceptability was high despite the technical problems in delivery.


Conclusions:
With a small number of participants, this study showed few effects of an SMS-based brief intervention on peak risky single-occasion drinking. Nevertheless, the study highlights areas for further investigation into the effects of EMI on young adults with heavy alcohol consumption.

Background:
Individuals in stressful work environments often experience mental health issues, such as depression. Reducing depression rates is difficult because of persistently stressful work environments and inadequate time or resources to access traditional mental health care services. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an opportunity to deliver real-time interventions in the real world. In addition, the delivery times of interventions can be based on real-time data collected with a mobile device. To date, data and analyses informing the timing of delivery of mHealth interventions are generally lacking.


Objective:
This study aimed to investigate when to provide mHealth interventions to individuals in stressful work environments to improve their behavior and mental health. The mHealth interventions targeted 3 categories of behavior: mood, activity, and sleep. The interventions aimed to improve 3 different outcomes: weekly mood (assessed through a daily survey), weekly step count, and weekly sleep time. We explored when these interventions were most effective, based on previous mood, step, and sleep scores.


Methods:
We conducted a 6-month micro-randomized trial on 1565 medical interns. Medical internship, during the first year of physician residency training, is highly stressful, resulting in depression rates several folds higher than those of the general population. Every week, interns were randomly assigned to receive push notifications related to a particular category (mood, activity, sleep, or no notifications). Every day, we collected interns’ daily mood valence, sleep, and step data. We assessed the causal effect moderation by the previous week’s mood, steps, and sleep. Specifically, we examined changes in the effect of notifications containing mood, activity, and sleep messages based on the previous week’s mood, step, and sleep scores. Moderation was assessed with a weighted and centered least-squares estimator.


Results:
We found that the previous week’s mood negatively moderated the effect of notifications on the current week’s mood with an estimated moderation of −0.052 (P=.001). That is, notifications had a better impact on mood when the studied interns had a low mood in the previous week. Similarly, we found that the previous week’s step count negatively moderated the effect of activity notifications on the current week’s step count, with an estimated moderation of −0.039 (P=.01) and that the previous week’s sleep negatively moderated the effect of sleep notifications on the current week’s sleep with an estimated moderation of −0.075 (P<.001). For all three of these moderators, we estimated that the treatment effect was positive (beneficial) when the moderator was low, and negative (harmful) when the moderator was high.


Conclusions:
These findings suggest that an individual’s current state meaningfully influences their receptivity to mHealth interventions for mental health. Timing interventions to match an individual’s state may be critical to maximizing the efficacy of interventions.

Dietary guidelines typically specify rather complex goals and indicators for healthy food choices, such as nutrient and energy content patterns. However, translating these complex goals into practice in real life is often a major obstacle for many people. The present studies propose an intervention strategy for boosting healthy food choices by prompting consumers at a meaningful moment with a simple behavioural trigger, that is to eat a colourful lunch. Effectivity and feasibility of this intervention strategy were tested in two laboratory experiments and one real-life, smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Intervention.

Methods

In Studies 1 and 2, 83 / 42 participants self-served four meals (colourful, typical, healthy, and low-calorie) / three meals (colourful, typical, and varied) from a Fake Food Buffet. In Study 3, 80 participants recorded images of 1,210 lunch meals over a period of 3 weeks using mobile visual food recording. In the second week, participants additionally received a daily smartphone prompt to eat a colourful lunch. In all studies, participants were asked to rate the prompts’ feasibility.

Results

Prompting participants to eat a colourful meal increased the proportion of healthy foods consumed compared to typical meals in all three studies. In Studies 1 and 2, colourful meals contained more fruit and vegetables, while in Study 3 the prompt increased vegetable consumption. Furthermore, participants evaluated colourful meals to be the tastiest (Study 1) and most pleasant, and reported that the prompt was easy to follow and act upon.

Conclusions

Results suggest that prompting individuals to eat colourful meals is a promising strategy to facilitate healthy food choices in daily life.

Long-term weight loss maintenance is difficult to achieve. Effectiveness of obesity interventions could be increased by providing extended treatment, and by focusing on person-environment interactions. Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) can account for these two factors by allowing an indefinite extension of a treatment protocol in everyday life. EMI relies on observations in daily life to intervene by providing appropriate in-the-moment treatment. The Think Slim intervention is an EMI based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and its effectiveness will be investigated in the current study.

Methods

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. At least 134 overweight adults (body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg/m2) will be randomly assigned to an 8-week immediate intervention group (Diet + Think Slim intervention, n = 67) or to an 8-week diet-only control group (followed by the Think Slim intervention, n = 67). The Think Slim intervention consists of (1) an app-based EMI that estimates and intervenes when people are likely to overeat, based on Ecological Momentary Assessment data, and (2) ten online computerised CBT sessions which work in conjunction with an EMI module in the app. The primary outcome is BMI. Secondary outcomes include (1) scores on self-report questionnaires for dysfunctional thinking, eating styles, eating disorder pathology, general psychological symptomatology, and self-esteem, and (2) eating patterns, investigated via network analysis. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at 3- and 12-month follow-up measurements.

Discussion

This is the first EMI aimed at treating obesity via a cognitive approach, provided via a smartphone app and the Internet, in the context of an RCT.

Abstract
Background

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) influence behavior in real time, in real life. We evaluated trial feasibility and preliminary efficacy of MOMENT, a counseling-plus-EMI to reduce frequent marijuana use in youth in primary care.

Methods

Primary care patients age 15–24 years using marijuana at least 3 times/week were randomized to MOMENT [motivational enhancement therapy (MET)/smartphone-based momentary assessment/responsive motivational messaging] vs. No-messages (MET/momentary assessment) vs. MET-only. In MOMENT, two MET sessions were followed by 2 weeks of momentary assessment of marijuana use and factors related to use, with motivational messaging displayed after report of marijuana triggers, desire, use, and effort to avoid use. We evaluated study feasibility (recruitment, retention, and response rates; feedback survey responses) and explored intervention effects on marijuana desire and use at three months with linear mixed effects modeling.

Results

Seventy youth [mean (M) =20.7 years, 60% female] were assigned to MOMENT (n=27), No-messages (n=15; assignment suspended to enrich other arms), or MET-only (n=28). Most attrition occurred during baseline, before MET. Of those completing MET session 1, 82% completed their assigned treatment and 79% provided 3-month data. Participants highly rated acceptability; comments reflected changing motivation and behavior. Across arms, participants reported significantly lower marijuana use, desire, and problems at follow-up vs. baseline. Momentary marijuana desire declined more in MOMENT vs. MET-only. Marijuana use following a targeted context or behavior was less likely in MOMENT and No-messages, vs. MET-only.

Conclusions

The MOMENT intervention is feasible to deliver, acceptable, and potentially efficacious in reducing marijuana desire and use among adolescent and young adults in primary care. A larger randomized trial to evaluate efficacy is warranted.

Abstract

Tobacco use is increasingly concentrated within marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ young adults. Developing tailored interventions to reduce tobacco-related health disparities requires understanding the mechanisms linking individual and contextual factors associated with tobacco use to behavior. This paper presents an in-depth exploration of three cases from a novel mixed method study designed to identify the situational factors and place-based practices of substance use among high-risk individuals. We combined geographically explicit ecological momentary assessment (GEMA) with an adapted travel diary-interview method. Participants (young adult bisexual smokers, ages 18–26) reported on non-smoking and smoking situations for 30 days with a smartphone app. GEMA surveys captured internal and external situational factors (e.g., craving intensity, location type, seeing others smoking). Continuous locational data was collected via smartphone GPS. Subsequently, participants completed in-depth interviews reviewing maps of their own GEMA data. GEMA data and transcripts were analyzed separately and integrated at the case level in a matrix. Using GEMA maps to guide the interview grounded discussion in participants' everyday smoking situations and routines. Interviews clarified participant interpretation of GEMA measures and revealed experiences and meanings of smoking locations and practices. The GEMA method identified the most frequent smoking locations/times for each participant (e.g., afternoons at university). Interviews provided description of associated situational factors and perceptions of smoking contexts (e.g., peer rejection of bisexual identity) and the roles of smoking therein (e.g., physically escape uncomfortable environments). In conclusion, this mixed method contributes to advancing qualitative GIS and other hypothesis-generating approaches working to reveal the richness of individuals’ experiences of the everyday contexts of health behavior, while also providing reliable measures of situational predictors of behaviors of interest, such as substance use. Limitations of and future directions for the method are discussed.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0277953618300704,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:iXzOJH4KylEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract
In this paper, we present m-Path (www.m-Path.io), an online platform that provides a user-friendly and flexible framework for implementing smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and intervention (EMI) in both research and clinical practice in the context of blended care. Because real-time monitoring and intervention in people’s everyday lives have unparalleled benefits compared to traditional data collection techniques (e.g., experiments or retrospective surveys), EMA and EMI have become popular in recent years. On the one hand, the surge in use of these methods requires software that allows for increasingly complex designs and functionalities. On the other hand, EMA and EMI platforms should remain easy to use and accessible for researchers and clinicians with limited programming skills. m-Path accommodates to both of these needs, offering an intuitive web interface to set up highly tailorable smartphone-based EMA and EMI protocols. In this article, we review the strengths of daily life data collection and intervention in general and m-Path in particular. We discuss the regular workflow to design an EMA or EMI protocol within the m-Path framework, and summarize both the basic functionalities and more advanced features of our software.

Suicide and suicide-related behaviors are prevalent yet notoriously difficult to predict. Specifically, short-term predictors and correlates of suicide risk remain largely unknown. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) may be used to assess how suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) unfold in real-world contexts. We conducted a systematic literature review of EMA studies in suicide research to assess (1) how EMA has been utilized in the study of STBs (i.e., methodology, findings), and (2) the feasibility, validity and safety of EMA in the study of STBs. We identified 45 articles, detailing 23 studies. Studies mainly focused on examining how known longitudinal predictors of suicidal ideation perform within shorter (hourly, daily) time frames. Recent studies have explored the prospects of digital phenotyping of individuals with suicidal ideation. The results indicate that suicidal ideation fluctuates substantially over time (hours, days), and that individuals with higher mean ideation also have more fluctuations. Higher suicidal ideation instability may represent a phenotypic indicator for increased suicide risk. Few studies succeeded in establishing prospective predictors of suicidal ideation beyond prior ideation itself. Some studies show negative affect, hopelessness and burdensomeness to predict increased ideation within-day, and sleep characteristics to impact next-day ideation. The feasibility of EMA is encouraging: agreement to participate in EMA research was moderate to high (median = 77%), and compliance rates similar to those in other clinical samples (median response rate = 70%). More individuals reported suicidal ideation through EMA than traditional (retrospective) self-report measures. Regarding safety, no evidence was found of systematic reactivity of mood or suicidal ideation to repeated assessments of STBs. In conclusion, suicidal ideation can fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, and EMA is a suitable method for capturing these fluctuations. Some specific predictors of subsequent ideation have been identified, but these findings warrant further replication. While repeated EMA assessments do not appear to result in systematic reactivity in STBs, participant burden and safety remains a consideration when studying high-risk populations. Considerations for designing and reporting on EMA studies in suicide research are discussed.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.876595/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:VHHv0LDDNe0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

Background:
An increasing number of mobile app interventions have been developed for problem drinking among college students; however, few studies have examined the integration of a mobile app with continuous physiological monitoring and alerting of affective states related to drinking behaviors.


Objective:
The aim of this paper was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of Mind the Moment (MtM), a theoretically based intervention for female college students with problem drinking that combines brief, in-person counseling with ecological momentary intervention (EMI) on a mobile app integrated with a wearable sensorband.


Methods:
We recruited 10 non-treatment seeking, female undergraduates from a university health clinic who scored a 3 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption (AUDIT-C) to participate in this pilot study. Study activities involved an in-person baseline intake and 1 follow-up assessment, 2 in-person alcohol brief intervention counseling sessions, and use of MtM technology components (sensorband and EMI on a mobile app) for approximately 3-4 weeks. The intervention used motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies for reducing risks associated with drinking. We used both qualitative and quantitative assessments to measure acceptability of the intervention and feasibility of delivery. Use patterns of the sensorband and mobile app were also collected.


Results:
Quantitative and qualitative data indicated high levels of acceptability for the MtM intervention. Altogether, participants made reports on the app on 26.7% (78/292) the days the technology was available to them and completed a total of 325 reports with wide variation between participants. Qualitative findings indicated that sensorband-elicited alerts promoted an increase in awareness of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to current environmental stressors and drinking behaviors in theoretically meaningful ways. Specific challenges related to functionality and form of the sensorband were identified.


Conclusions:
Delivering intervention material “just-in-time,” at the moment participants need to use behavioral strategies has great potential to individualize behavioral interventions for reducing problem drinking and other health behaviors. These findings provide initial evidence for the promise of wearable sensors for increasing potency of theoretically grounded mobile health interventions and point to directions for future research and uptake of these technologies.

Background

Up to 50% of patients with psychotic-spectrum disorders are medication nonadherent. The use of real-time assessment via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) on mobile devices might offer important insights into adherence behaviors that cannot be measured in the clinic. However, existing EMA studies have only studied acutely ill patients during hospitalization or more stable patients in the community.

Methods

Feasibility and acceptability of EMA in 65 patients with psychotic-spectrum disorders who were recently discharged from the hospital were assessed. EMA was administered for four weeks via study-provided mobile devices. Feasibility was measured by study recruitment/retention rates, patients' connectivity, and completion rates. Quantitative and qualitative acceptability data were collected.

Results

Participants completed 28–31% of offered EMA assessments. The only significant predictor of reduced EMA completion was recent cannabis use. EMA completion was maintained from weeks 1 to 3 but significantly dropped at the fourth week. Patient acceptability feedback was generally positive; negative comments related primarily to technological problems.

Conclusions

This was the first study to use EMA in recently discharged patients with psychotic-spectrum disorders. EMA is feasible and acceptable in this population, but completion rates were lower than in more stable samples. Future research should consider limiting the assessment period, screening for substance use, and integrating assessment with intervention elements to increase EMA engagement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5369417/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:xtS1k1LNCWEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
Healthy behaviors are crucial for maintaining a person’s health and well-being. The effects of health behavior interventions are mediated by individual and contextual factors that vary over time. Recently emerging smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) can use real-time user reports (ecological momentary assessments [EMAs]) to trigger appropriate support when needed in daily life.


Objective:
This systematic review aims to assess the characteristics of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs in relation to their effects on health behaviors, user engagement, and user perspectives.


Methods:
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL in June 2019 and updated the search in March 2020. We included experimental studies that incorporated EMIs based on EMAs delivered through smartphone apps to promote health behaviors in any health domain. Studies were independently screened. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. We performed a narrative synthesis of intervention effects, user perspectives and engagement, and intervention design and characteristics. Quality appraisal was conducted for all included studies.


Results:
We included 19 papers describing 17 unique studies and comprising 652 participants. Most studies were quasi-experimental (13/17, 76%), had small sample sizes, and great heterogeneity in intervention designs and measurements. EMIs were most popular in the mental health domain (8/17, 47%), followed by substance abuse (3/17, 18%), diet, weight loss, physical activity (4/17, 24%), and smoking (2/17, 12%). Of the 17 studies, the 4 (24%) included randomized controlled trials reported nonstatistically significant effects on health behaviors, and 4 (24%) quasi-experimental studies reported statistically significant pre-post improvements in self-reported primary outcomes, namely depressive (P<.001) and psychotic symptoms (P=.03), drinking frequency (P<.001), and eating patterns (P=.01). EMA was commonly used to capture subjective experiences as well as behaviors, whereas sensors were rarely used. Generally, users perceived EMIs to be helpful. Common suggestions for improvement included enhancing personalization, multimedia and interactive capabilities (eg, voice recording), and lowering the EMA reporting burden. EMI and EMA components were rarely reported and were not described in a standardized manner across studies, hampering progress in this field. A reporting checklist was developed to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of findings and enhance the transparency and replicability of future studies using EMAs and EMIs.


Conclusions:
The use of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs to promote behavior change is an emerging area of research, with few studies evaluating efficacy. Such interventions could present an opportunity to enhance health but need further assessment in larger participant cohorts and well-designed evaluations following reporting checklists. Future research should explore combining self-reported EMAs of subjective experiences with objective data passively collected via sensors to promote personalization while minimizing user burden, as well as explore different EMA data collection methods (eg, chatbots).

Context: Substance use disorders (SUDs) are highly prevalent among inpatient adolescents with psychiatric disorders. In this population, substance use and other psychiatric outcomes can reinforce one another. Despite the need for integrated interventions in youths with dual diagnoses, few specific instruments are available. App-based technologies have shown promising results to help reduce substance use in adolescents, but their applicability in youths with associated severe psychiatric disorders is poorly documented. We aim to evaluate the feasibility of an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) intervention for all substance users, and of a smartphone application for cannabis users (Stop-Cannabis), for outpatient treatment after hospital discharge.

Methods and analysis: All inpatient adolescents with psychiatric disorders hospitalized between 2016 and 2018 in a university hospital will be systematically screened for SUD and, if positive, will be assessed by an independent specialist addiction team. Participants with confirmed SUDs will be invited and helped to download an EMA app and, if required, the Stop-Cannabis app, the week preceding hospital discharge. Information about the acceptability and use of both apps and the validity of EMA data in comparison to clinical assessments will be assessed after 6 months and 1 year.

Discussion: This research has been designed to raise specific issues for consideration regarding the sequence between substance use, contextual factors, and other psychiatric symptoms among adolescents with comorbid severe psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved will inform the development of integrated treatment for dual disorders at that age.

Ethics and dissemination: The study has already been approved and granted. Dissemination will include presentations at international congresses as well as publications in peer-reviewed journals.

Abstract

This study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of an interactive smartphone application that aimed to improve daily-life social functioning and symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) with Experience Sampling Method (ESM) derived personalised feedback.Two groups of outpatients with a diagnosis of SZ were included (one receiving ESM-derived personalised feedback (n = 27) and one without feedback (n = 23)) and used the interactive smartphone application for three weeks. Main outcomes were momentary symptoms and social functioning, as assessed by ESM questionnaires. Additionally, feasibility and user-friendliness of the application were assessed. The response rate was 64% for the ESM questionnaires. In the feedback group, participants indicated that on 49% of the ESM days they acted on at least one personalised feedback prompt per day. Momentary psychotic symptoms significantly decreased over time only in the feedback group. Momentary loneliness and questionnaire-assessed psychotic symptoms decreased over time, irrespective of feedback. Participants evaluated the app as user-friendly and understandable. Momentary personalised feedback may impact momentary psychosis in daily life. Feelings of loneliness and questionnaire-based measured psychotic symptoms may be more responsive to non-specific effects of daily-life self-monitoring, not requiring specific feedback. Ecological momentary interventions offer opportunities for accessible and effective interventions in SZ.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178119316233,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:U0L-frZHLC4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphones with the aim of increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and providing scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, which are considered the gold standard for the treatment of most mental health problems.


Objective:
This review investigates standalone smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) built on principles derived from CBT that aim to improve mental health.


Methods:
We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2020. We included studies focusing on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, for example, app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, that is, choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in the primary outcomes used in the studies.


Results:
A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (mean 70.8%, SD 15.3; n=4 studies) and satisfying for users (mean 72.6%, SD 17.2; n=7 studies).


Conclusions:
Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily lives. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable, and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.

A major problem in mental health clinical trials, such as depression, is low assay sensitivity in primary outcome measures. This has contributed to clinical trial failures, resulting in the exodus of the pharmaceutical industry from the Central Nervous System space. This reduced assay sensitivity in psychiatry outcome measures stems from inappropriately broad measures, recall bias, and poor interrater reliability. Limitations in the ability of traditional measures to differentiate between the trait versus state-like nature of individual depressive symptoms also contributes to measurement error in clinical trials. In this viewpoint, we argue that ecological momentary assessment (EMA)—frequent, real time, in-the-moment assessments of outcomes, delivered via smartphone—can both overcome these psychometric challenges and reduce clinical trial failures by increasing assay sensitivity and minimizing recall and rater bias. Used in this manner, EMA has the potential to further our understanding of treatment response by allowing for the assessment of dynamic interactions between treatment and distinct symptom response.

Abstract

Common approaches to the psychological treatment of distressing voice hearing experiences, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, aim to promote more adaptive cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses to these experiences. Digital technologies such as smartphones show promise for supporting and enhancing these treatments by linking immediate therapeutic settings to the context of daily life. Two promising technologies include ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I), which may offer a means of advanced assessment and support in daily life, and inform the tailoring of interventions to suit individual needs. In this study, a highly novel intervention approach was developed involving four face-to-face sessions with a psychologist blended with EMA/I between sessions in order to improve coping with distressing voice hearing experiences. The authors describe the background and development of this approach along-side a single case illustration, which supported feasibility and acceptability. This study details how digital technologies such as EMA/I may be used in future as clinical tools to enhance standard psychological treatments and clinical care of people with persisting and distressing experiences.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782918300630,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:h2Mdxci8QiMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Summary

This chapter addresses application of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to substance use research, outlining principles of EMA design and analysis, and illustrates them with examples. It considers the way technological innovations are facilitating the rapid evolution of EMA systems, and provides recommendations on current best practices. The chapter reviews data on methodological issues such as compliance and reactivity. EMA sampling design focuses on the way assessments of individual- and systems-level processes are distributed over time and space. EMA methods reveal substance use patterns not captured by questionnaires or retrospective data, and hold great promise for substance use research and treatment. As EMA methods are further developed and broadly applied, they offer even more detailed insight into substance use and abuse. Further, application of EMA approaches to on-the-spot intervention with substance users holds potential to revolutionize treatment delivery.

Abstract
Background

Depressive disorders are a major public health problem, and many people face barriers to accessing evidence-based mental health treatment. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may circumvent logistical barriers to in-person care (e.g., cost, transportation), however the symptoms of depression (low motivation, concentration difficulties) may make it difficult for people with the disorder to engage with mHealth.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review is to examine assessment and reporting of engagement in clinical trials of mHealth interventions for depression, including objective engagement (e.g., number of times program is used), subjective engagement (e.g., qualitative data on users' experiences), and associations between engagement and other clinically important variables (e.g., symptom improvement, participant characteristics).

Methods

Three electronic databases (PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed) were searched in February 2020 using search terms for mHealth and depression. Studies were included in the review if they tested a mHealth intervention designed for people with depressive disorders or elevated depression symptoms.

Results

Thirty studies met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Most studies reported objective engagement (N = 23, 76.7%), approximately half reported subjective engagement (N = 16, 53.3%), and relatively few examined associations between engagement and clinical improvement, participant characteristics, or other clinically relevant variables (N = 13, 43.3%).

Conclusions

Although most studies in this small but rapidly growing literature report at least one measure of engagement, there is substantial heterogeneity. Intentional, theory-driven, and consistent measurement of engagement with mHealth interventions for depression may advance the field's understanding of effective engagement to facilitate clinical improvement, identify dose-response relationships, and maximize generalizability for underserved populations.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782921000944,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1M7DVbd67FkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Depression treatment might be enhanced by ecological momentary interventions (EMI) based on self-monitoring and person-specific feedback. This study is the first to examine the efficacy of two different EMI modules for depression in routine clinical practice.

Methods

Outpatients starting depression treatment at secondary mental health services (N = 161; MIDS−DEPRESSION = 35.9, S.D. = 10.7; MAGE = 32.8, S.D. = 12.1; 46% male) participated in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with three arms. Two experimental groups engaged in 28 days of systematic self-monitoring (5 times per day), and received weekly feedback on either positive affect and activities (Do-module) or negative affect and thinking patterns (Think-module). The control group received no additional intervention. Participants completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms (primary outcome), social functioning, and empowerment before and after the intervention period, and at four measurements during a 6-month follow-up period.

Results

Of the 90 (out of 110) participants who completed the intervention, 86% would recommend it. However, the experimental groups did not show significantly more or faster changes over time than the control group in terms of depressive symptoms, social functioning, and empowerment. Furthermore, the trajectories of the two EMI modules were very similar.

Conclusions

We did not find statistical evidence that this type of EMI augments the efficacy of regular depression treatment, regardless of module content. We cannot rule out that EMIs have a positive impact on other domains or provide a more efficient way of delivering care. Nonetheless, EMI's promise of effectiveness has not materialized yet.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/01D099D952F5BA8B3364F9A96E5D23E5/S0033291720004845a.pdf/an_evaluation_of_the_efficacy_of_two_addon_ecological_momentary_intervention_modules_for_depression_in_a_pragmatic_randomized_controlled_trial_zelfi.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1UwLdYC1GsgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.cambridge.org

Background

Previous research employing global positioning satellite (GPS) data and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has shown a smaller life-space (distance traveled from home) was associated with poorer community functioning and more severe negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia. Momentary emotional experiences may influence how much time is spent outside of the home. We evaluated the associations between emotional experiences in relation to life-space among people with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (HCs).

Methods

105 participants with schizophrenia and 76 HCs completed in-lab assessments of symptoms, cognition, and functioning. Participants completed EMA assessments of location and emotions seven times daily for seven days at stratified random intervals. GPS coordinates were collected 24 h a day over the 7-day study period. Analyses were performed at the momentary, day, and full week level using mixed effects models and Spearman correlations.

Results

For HCs, greater happiness was associated with greater concurrent distance traveled away from home as measured by GPS. For participants with schizophrenia, greater anxiety was associated with greater distance traveled away from home and being outside of the home. Less happiness, but not anxiety, was also associated with greater negative symptoms, especially outside the home.

Discussion

These findings suggest diminished positive emotion is associated with the experience of leaving the home in schizophrenia, but also suggest that anxiety may contribute to avoidance of out of home mobility. Interventions targeting both positive emotions and social anxiety may improve social functioning, and life-space may provide a useful outcome for functional rehabilitation interventions in schizophrenia.",https://hal.science/hal-03090925/document,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:DFm1reJMmsQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Affect regulation models state that affect both motivates and reinforces alcohol use. We aimed to examine whether affect levels and rates of change differed across drinking versus nondrinking days in a manner consistent with affect regulation models. Four hundred four regularly drinking adults, aged 18–70 years, completed ecological momentary assessments over 3 weeks. Participants provided positive affect (PA; enthusiastic, excited, happy) and negative affect (NA; distressed, sad) reports during all prompts; alcohol consumption reports were also provided. Multilevel spline models revealed that on drinking days, PA was higher and NA was lower both before and after drinking compared to matched times on nondrinking days. PA and NA were also higher and lower, respectively, both before and after drinking, when heavy drinking days were compared to moderate drinking days. Examination of affect rates of change revealed that (a) accelerating increases in PA and accelerating decreases in NA preceded drinking initiation, (b) PA increases and NA decreases were seen up to 2 hr after drinking initiation, and (c) pre- and postdrinking PA increases were larger on heavy versus moderate drinking days, whereas only postdrinking NA decreases were larger on heavy drinking days. Results supported affect regulation models while adding nuance, showing accelerating changes in predrinking affect on drinking days and pre- and postdrinking differences in affect levels and rates of change across days of varying drinking intensity. Beyond theory, our results suggest that accelerating changes in affect may provide a clue to future commencement of heavy drinking, which may aid momentary intervention development.

Alcohol abuse, other substance use disorders, and risk behaviors associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) represent three of the top 10 modifiable causes of mortality in the US. Despite evidence that continuing care is effective in sustaining recovery from substance use disorders and associated behaviors, patients rarely receive it. Smartphone applications (apps) have been effective in delivering continuing care to patients almost anywhere and anytime. This study tests the effectiveness of two components of such apps: ongoing self-monitoring through Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and immediate recovery support through Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs).

Methods/design

The target population, adults enrolled in substance use disorder treatment (n = 400), are being recruited from treatment centers in Chicago and randomly assigned to one of four conditions upon discharge in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Participants receive (1) EMAs only, (2) EMIs only, (3) combined EMAs + EMIs, or (4) a control condition without EMA or EMI for 6 months. People in the experimental conditions receive smartphones with the apps (EMA and/or EMI) specific to their condition. Phones alert participants in the EMA and EMA + EMI conditions at five random times per day and present participants with questions about people, places, activities, and feelings that they experienced in the past 30 min and whether these factors make them want to use substances, support their recovery, or have no impact. Those in the EMI and EMA + EMI conditions have continual access to a suite of support services. In the EMA + EMI condition, participants are prompted to use the EMI(s) when responses to the EMA(s) indicate risk. All groups have access to recovery support as usual. The primary outcome is days of abstinence from alcohol and other drugs. Secondary outcomes are number of HIV risk behaviors and whether abstinence mediates the effects of EMA, EMI, or EMA + EMI on HIV risk behaviors.

Discussion

This project will enable the field to learn more about the effects of EMAs and EMIs on substance use disorders and HIV risk behaviors, an understanding that could potentially make treatment and recovery more effective and more widely accessible.

The aim of the present review is to systematically examine published data regarding ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in children and adolescents with mood disorders.

Recent Findings

EMA is increasingly used to collect participant’s information in their real environment and in real time. There are multiple studies focused on the evaluation of mood disorders in children and adolescents, but only a few of them used EMA protocols.

Summary

Results found in this review showed a wide variability of works with different fields of study, methodological approaches, and EMA protocols. More than 60% of EMA studies in children and adolescents with mood disorders were conducted via phone call, showing high completion rates with data missing in 5 to 11.5% of the calls. Length of studies varied from a 4-day EMA protocol to a maximum of 8 weeks. Positive and negative affect, daily activities, and social context were the main EMA measures. Despite the limited number of studies using EMA in children and adolescents with mood disorders, EMA was useful in assessing mood symptoms in the moment and in patients’ real-life environment. Studies also showed high completion and satisfaction rates. Although web pages and apps use have been increasing over the past years, the evidence base is still scarce. Future studies can facilitate understanding of EMA methodology among youth with mood disorders.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:gafW3NlxGsQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Background:
Many suicide risk factors have been identified, but traditional clinical methods do not allow for the accurate prediction of suicide behaviors. To face this challenge, emma, an app for ecological momentary assessment (EMA), ecological momentary intervention (EMI), and prediction of suicide risk in high-risk patients, was developed.


Objective:
The aim of this case report study was to describe how subjects at high risk of suicide use the emma app in real-world conditions.


Methods:
The Ecological Mental Momentary Assessment (EMMA) study is an ongoing, longitudinal, interventional, multicenter trial in which patients at high risk for suicide are recruited to test emma, an app designed to be used as a self-help tool for suicidal crisis management. Participants undergo clinical assessment at months 0, 1, 3, and 6 after inclusion, mainly to assess and characterize the presence of mental disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Patient recruitment is still ongoing. Some data from the first 14 participants who already completed the 6-month follow-up were selected for this case report study, which evaluated the following: (1) data collected by emma (ie, responses to EMAs), (2) metadata on emma use, (3) clinical data, and (4) qualitative assessment of the participants' experiences.


Results:
EMA completion rates were extremely heterogeneous with a sharp decrease over time. The completion rates of the weekly EMAs (25%-87%) were higher than those of the daily EMAs (0%-53%). Most patients (10/14, 71%) answered the EMA questionnaires spontaneously. Similarly, the use of the Safety Plan Modules was very heterogeneous (2-75 times). Specifically, 11 patients out of 14 (79%) used the Call Module (1-29 times), which was designed by our team to help them get in touch with health care professionals and/or relatives during a crisis. The diversity of patient profiles and use of the EMA and EMI modules proposed by emma were highlighted by three case reports.


Conclusions:
These preliminary results indicate that patients have different clinical and digital profiles and needs that require a highly scalable, interactive, and customizable app. They also suggest that it is possible and acceptable to collect longitudinal, fine-grained, contextualized data (ie, EMA) and to offer personalized intervention (ie, EMI) in real time to people at high risk of suicide. To become a complementary tool for suicide prevention, emma should be integrated into existing emergency procedures.

More and more people use self-tracking technologies to track their psychological states, physiology, and behaviors to gain a better understanding of themselves or to achieve a certain goal. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) also offers an excellent opportunity for restorative environments research, which examines how our physical environment (especially nature) can positively influence health and wellbeing. It enables investigating restorative health effects in everyday life, providing not only high ecological validity but also opportunities to study in more detail the dynamic processes playing out over time on recovery, thereby bridging the gap between laboratory (i.e., short-term effects) and epidemiological (long-term effects) research. We have identified four main areas in which self-tracking could help advance restoration research: (1) capturing a rich set of environment types and restorative characteristics; (2) distinguishing intra-individual from inter-individual effects; (3) bridging the gap between laboratory and epidemiological research; and (4) advancing theoretical insights by measuring a more broad range of effects in everyday life.

Introduction As smartphones are widely distributed nowadays, mental health apps seem to be a promising treatment tool. First self-help apps for eating disorders have been developed recently. However, studies assessing the efficacy of such apps are scarce. A smartphone app could prevent further weight reduction and increase commitment during waiting time for outpatient treatment, especially for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study protocol, a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a smartphone-enhanced low-threshold intervention for AN during waiting time is described.

Methods and analysis 30 adolescents with AN aged 12–19 years will be recruited at three child and adolescent psychiatry centres in Germany. All participants will be randomised to consultations only or consultations and the use of the Jourvie Research app. The app will be installed either on their own smartphone or on a research device. The participants will receive biweekly to monthly consultations for 3 months to review meal plans and weight management with a clinician. In addition, the Jourvie Research app for meal, behaviour and emotion protocolling will be provided to the intervention group. The protocols will be discussed with a clinician during the consultations. Dialectical behaviour therapy-informed skills for tension regulation to increase compliance with the meal plan will be taught in the intervention group and the app will remind the participant of a skill in a moment of need. The primary outcome is the age-adjusted and height-adjusted weight gain in standard deviation score after 3 months.

Ethics and dissemination Results will be disseminated at conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. The trial was approved by the ethics review board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference number 837.338.15.

Smartphone-based interventions are a potentially effective way to minimize alcohol-related harm in young adult, non-dependent drinkers. This pilot study is the first to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of a personalized alcohol harm-minimization intervention delivered via smartphones.

Methods

Within a single-blind, randomized controlled design, 45 young adults were randomly assigned to either the intervention app (n = 25; 18 females; Mage = 21.36 years, SDage = 4.15 years) or the control app (n = 20; 18 females; Mage = 22.75; SDage = 4.41). The two primary outcomes were frequency of risky drinking and drinking-related harms, and the secondary outcome was frequency of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) use. All outcomes were measured at baseline and immediately post-intervention. Using the Enlight framework [1], usability was evaluated via structured one-on-one phone interviews with a subgroup of six participants from the intervention group (3 females; Mage = 19.5 years, SDage = 1.64).

Results

There was no significant reduction in the primary outcomes from baseline to post-intervention across the groups. For the secondary outcome, the application of PBS within drinking contexts increased at follow-up for those in the intervention group but not for control participants. End-users rated the app as highly usable but had some concerns with repetition of the app-recommended strategies.

Conclusions

This intervention, designed to reduce risky drinking behaviors among young adults, was rated as highly usable and was shown to increase the application of harm minimization strategies within drinking contexts. While the intervention and its delivery show promise, it did not appear to mitigate risky drinking behaviors. Implications of this research and future directions are discussed.

Abstract

Purpose: The main objectives of this manuscript were to provide a theoretical perspective on naturalistic delivery in rehabilitation based upon a literature review and establish a rationale for using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for naturalistic assessment for chronic illness and disability (CID) in rehabilitation.

Method: Existing literature on EMA use across CID cohorts was gathered and analyzed to form a theoretical overview of implementation of this method in research. This review summarizes study results and provides a comprehensive literature table for greater analysis.

Results: EMA has been shown to optimize clinician time and reduce costs, reach greater numbers of people with disability-related needs, and reduce the need for retrospective recall through the collection of more objective data. Mixed method approaches were most commonly seen in the literature, and sampling schedules and the outcomes assessed varied widely.

Conclusions: EMA is emerging as a novel modality of assessment in rehabilitation. Scientists and clinicians should consider incorporating this assessment approach as a rehabilitation tool that may more accurately assess the complex and dynamic nature of disability over the long-term through an objective and ecologically-valid data source.

Background:
Numerous smartphone apps are targeting physical activity and healthy eating, but empirical evidence on their effectiveness for initialization and maintenance of behavior change, especially in children and adolescents, is still limited.


Objective:
The aim of this study was to conceptualize a theory-based and evidence-based mHealth intervention called SMARTFAMILY (SF) that targets physical activity and healthy eating in a collective family-based setting. Subsequently, the app will be refined and re-evaluated to analyze additional effects of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and gamification features.


Methods:
A smartphone app based on behavior change theories and behavior change techniques was developed and implemented and will be evaluated with family members individually and cooperatively (SF trial). Existing evidence and gained results were used to refine and will be used to re-evaluate the app (SF2.0 trial). Both trials are cluster randomized controlled trials with 3 measurement occasions. The intervention group uses the app for 3 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group receives no treatment. Baseline measurements (T0) and postintervention measurements (T1) include physical activity (ie, self-reported and accelerometry) and healthy eating measurements (ie, self-reported fruit and vegetable intake) as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes (ie, self-reported) are intrinsic motivation, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and the family health climate, complemented by an intentional measure in SF2.0. Four weeks following T1, a follow-up assessment (T2) is completed by the participants, consisting of all questionnaire items to assess the stability of the intervention effects. Mixed-method analysis of covariance will be used to calculate the primary intervention effects (ie, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) while controlling for covariates, including family health climate, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation.


Results:
This study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and ethically approved by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For both trials, it is hypothesized that the apps will positively influence physical activity and healthy eating in the whole family. Furthermore, SF2.0 is expected to produce stronger effects (ie, higher effect sizes) compared to SF. SF app development and piloting are completed. Data acquisition for the SF trial is terminated and discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF2.0 app development and piloting are completed, while data acquisition is ongoing. Participant recruitment for the SF 2.0 trial started in February 2020. The results for SF are expected to be published in mid-2021, and the results of SF2.0 are expected to be published in mid-2022.


Conclusions:
In this study, it is hypothesized that targeting the whole family will facilitate behavior change at the individual level and the family level, as the implemented strategies address changes in daily family life. Furthermore, subsequent app development (SF2.0) with supplementary addition of motivation-enhancing features and a JITAI approach is expected to enhance positive intervention effects.

Abstract

Heavy alcohol use is a serious health issue in the United States with consequences such as illness, injury, and death. College students are among the most vulnerable to problems associated with risky drinking. This demographic is known as the Net Generation because members have grown up with digital technologies such as smartphones and apps. Thus, mobile health (mHealth) applications, successful in the delivery of health information and interventions to tech-savvy individuals, are a promising means of reaching them. To that end, we developed a smartphone application (SmarTrek) that targets college students and aims to reduce risky alcohol use. SmarTrek features are easy to use and have interactive components including text messages that incorporate motivational interviewing and ecological momentary interventions. We conducted iterative theater testing, field testing, and focus groups to evaluate the acceptability of SmarTrek with college students. We identified salient issues that might arise from SmarTrek use and modified the app based on feedback from participants. Participants were assigned to 2 groups (Group 1 [n = 4] and Group 2 [n = 6]). At baseline, participants completed 2 standardized surveys. Following their field testing, each group of participants was then invited to a focus group session of the app in which they provided feedback. The majority of participants (90%) agreed that SmarTrek was easy to use and that the information provided was useful and had a positive effect on decreasing their drinking.

Abstract
Background

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a scientific self-monitoring method to capture individuals' daily life experiences. Early on, EMA has been suggested to have the potential to improve mental health care. However, it remains unclear if and how EMA should be implemented. This requires an in-depth investigation of how practitioners and researchers view the implementation of EMA.

Objective

Explore the perspectives of mental health practitioners and EMA researchers on the utility of EMA for mental health care.

Methods

Practitioners (n = 89; psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses) and EMA researchers (n = 62) completed a survey about EMA in clinical practice. This survey addressed EMA goals for practitioner and patient, requirements regarding clinical use of EMA, and (dis)advantages of EMA compared to treatment-as-usual. t-Tests were used to determine agreement with each statement and whether practitioners' and researchers' views differed significantly. Linear regression was used to explore predictors of goals and preferences (e.g., EMA experience).

Results

Practitioners and researchers considered EMA to be a useful clinical tool for diverse stages of care. They indicated EMA to be most useful for gaining insight into the context specificity of symptoms (55.0 %), whereas receiving alerts when symptoms increase was rated the least useful (11.3 %, alerts is in 95 % of bootstrap iterations between rank 8 and 10). Compared to treatment-as-usual, EMA was considered easier to use (M = 4.87, t = 5.30, p < .001) and interpret (M = 4.52, t = 3.61, p < .001), but also more burdensome for the patient (M = 4.48, t = 3.17, p < .001). Although participants preferred personalization of the EMA diary, they also suggested that EMA should cost practitioners and patients limited time. The preference for creating personalized EMA was related to the level of experience with EMA. Finally, they highlighted the need for practitioner training and patient full-time access to the EMA feedback.

Conclusions

This survey study demonstrated that practitioners and researchers expect EMA to have added value for mental health care. Concrete recommendations for implementation of EMA are formulated. This may inform the development of specific clinical applications and user-friendly EMA software.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782922000823,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:y_vqsi-Ufx0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Over 50% of people diagnosed with a severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, will meet criteria for a substance use disorder in their lifetime. This dual disorder often starts during youth and leads to significant societal costs, including lower employability rates, more hospitalizations, and higher risk of homelessness and of suicide attempts when compared to those with a serious mental illness without substance misuse. Moreover, many individuals presenting with comorbid disorders also present with other psychological difficulties as well, such as personality disorders or anxiety and depression, also known as complex comorbid disorders. Transdiagnostic treatments that focus on core difficulties found in people with complex dual disorders, such as emotional regulation, are direly needed. Emotional regulation skills can help reduce distress related to psychotic symptoms and maintain abstinence in substance use disorders. New technologies in the field of communications have developed considerably over the past decade and have the potential to improve access to such treatments, a major problem in many health care settings. As such, this paper aims at: presenting core difficulties present in many individuals with dual disorders, reviewing the scientific literature pertaining to the use of mobile applications in mental health and addictions, and presenting the development and potential of a new application for emotional regulation for people with dual disorders.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00302,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:FA3ZP3mOumcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

Assessment of awake bruxism (AB) is problematic due to the inability to use continuous recordings during daytime activities. Recently, a new semi-instrumental approach was suggested, namely, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), via the use of a smartphone application. With the application, subjects are requested to report, at least 12 times per day, the status of their masticatory muscle activity (relaxed muscles, muscle bracing without tooth contact, teeth contact, teeth clenching, or teeth grinding). The aim of the present study was to test the association between a single observation point self-report and EMA assessment of AB. The most frequent condition recorded by the EMA was relaxed muscles (ca. 60%) and the least frequent was teeth grinding (less than 1%). The relaxed muscle condition also showed the lowest coefficient of variance over a seven-day period of report. Additionally, only the relaxed muscles and the muscle bracing conditions presented an acceptable ability to assess AB-positive and AB-negative subjects, as defined by single-point self-report questions. The combination between self-report and EMA may have the potential to promote our ability to assess AB. We suggest to re-consider the conditions of teeth contact and teeth grinding while using EMA to evaluate AB.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/8/1699,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:lry1xQC-dCEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.mdpi.com

Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I) show promise for enhancing psychological treatments for psychosis. EMA has the potential to improve assessment and formulation of experiences which fluctuate day-to-day, and EMI may be used to prompt use of therapeutic strategies in daily life. The current study is an examination of these capabilities in the context of a brief, coping-focused intervention for distressing voice hearing experiences.

Methods/design

This is a rater-blinded, pilot randomised controlled trial comparing a four-session intervention in conjunction with use of smartphone EMA/I between sessions, versus treatment-as-usual. The recruitment target is 34 participants with persisting and distressing voice hearing experiences, recruited through a Voices Clinic based in Melbourne, Australia, and via wider advertising. Allocation will be made using minimisation procedure, balancing of the frequency of voices between groups. Assessments are completed at baseline and 8 weeks post-baseline. The primary outcomes of this trial will focus on feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methodology, with secondary outcomes examining preliminary clinical effects related to overall voice severity, the emotional and functional impact of the voices, and emotional distress.

Discussion

This study offers a highly novel examination of specific smartphone capabilities and their integration with traditional psychological treatment for distressing voices. Such technology has potential to enhance psychological interventions and promote adaptation to distressing experiences.

Abstract

Web-based stress management interventions are effective for college students, particularly those with interpersonal trauma histories. However, these interventions have not been assessed among those reporting childhood emotional abuse, a group with the most distress. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile phones to deliver near-real-time psychosocial interventions in daily life, offer the possibility of increasing intervention efficacy. This randomized controlled trial examined the feasibility and efficacy of an EMI for reducing psychological distress among students with and without an emotional abuse history. Undergraduate students (N = 382) were randomly assigned to receive (a) an EMI that taught stress management skills, or (b) an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with self-monitoring of stressors and mood. Both the EMI and EMA lasted for 14 days. Participants completed outcome measures (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress symptoms) at pretest, posttest, and 3-week follow-up. Overall, the EMI appeared feasible, acceptable, and usable, with 80% to 91% completion rates. Linear mixed models indicated that there were no significant Condition × Time interaction effects in the total sample, with decreases in perceived stress and increases in positive affect over time regardless of condition (EMI vs. EMA). Moderation analyses indicated that the EMI was generally more effective for those with a history of emotional abuse and that the EMA was more effective for those without such a history. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that participants wrote less in the EMI than in a web-based version of the intervention. Future interventions could target at-risk groups based on trauma history or baseline distress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract
Objective
The aim of Orientation Week is to help new students acclimatize to university life. However, Orientation Week is characterized by heavy alcohol use and during this time students may develop drinking patterns that persist into the academic year. The aim of the current study was to refine a brief Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) and test its effectiveness in reducing students’ alcohol use during both Orientation Week and throughout the academic year.
Method
We conducted two focus groups with students who had received a pilot intervention. We then updated and trialled the intervention with students from two residential colleges (College 1 n = 117 and College 2 n = 269) who were assigned to either an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) condition or an EMA-EMI condition. Students in both conditions reported their pre-university drinking and their drinking during Orientation Week and the academic year via text message. In addition to the EMA messages, during Orientation Week, participants in the EMA-EMI condition received messages highlighting the potential social consequences of heavy alcohol use.
Results
In College 1 those in the EMA-EMI condition consumed fewer drinks, relative to those in the EMA condition, across both Orientation Week (9.7 vs. 15.5; t(98) = 2.138, p = .018) and the academic year. (4.3 vs. 6.8; t(98) = 1.788, p = .039). There were, however, no significant differences between conditions in College 2.
Conclusion
The current findings suggest that EMIs may be successful under certain circumstances and may provide a simple, cost-effective means of intervening.

Background:
Repeatedly pushing high-calorie food stimuli away based on joystick movements has been found to reduce approach biases toward these stimuli. Some studies also found that such avoidance training reduced consumption of high-calorie foods.


Objective:
This study aimed to test effects of a smartphone-based approach-avoidance intervention on chocolate craving and consumption, to make such interventions suitable for daily use.


Methods:
Within a 10-day period, regular chocolate eaters (n=105, 86% female) performed five sessions during which they continuously avoided (ie, swiped upward) chocolate stimuli (experimental group, n=35), performed five sessions during which they approached and avoided chocolate stimuli equally often (placebo control group, n=35), or did not perform any training sessions (inactive control group, n=35). Training effects were measured during laboratory sessions before and after the intervention period and further continuously through daily ecological momentary assessment.


Results:
Self-reported chocolate craving and consumption as well as body fat mass significantly decreased from pre- to postmeasurement across all groups. Ecological momentary assessment reports evidenced no differences in chocolate craving and consumption between intervention days and rest days as a function of the group.


Conclusions:
A smartphone-based approach-avoidance training did not affect eating-related and anthropometric measures over and above measurement-based changes in this study. Future controlled studies need to examine whether other techniques of modifying food approach tendencies show an add-on benefit over conventional, monitoring-based intervention effects.

Background:
Low uptake rates of traditional gambling treatments highlight the need for innovative treatment modalities. Smartphone apps can provide unprecedented access to real-time ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) delivered in people’s everyday lives.


Objective:
This study aims to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of GamblingLess: Curb Your Urge, the first smartphone app–delivered EMI that aims to prevent gambling episodes by reducing craving intensity in people seeking help for gambling problems.


Methods:
This study was a single-arm, 5-week acceptability and feasibility trial (1-week baseline and 4-week intervention periods) involving ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) delivered 3 times daily. The EMAs measured gambling episodes, cravings, and self-efficacy. Web-based evaluations at baseline, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up measured gambling outcomes (severity, cravings, frequency, expenditure, and self-efficacy) and the intervention’s perceived helpfulness, relevance, burden, satisfaction, and impact in relation to gambling cravings.


Results:
A total of 36 participants, of whom 22/36 (61%) were male and 34/36 (94%) were problem gamblers, completed the baseline measures, with 61% (22/36) completing the postintervention evaluation and 58% (21/36) completing the follow-up evaluation. The intervention was considered acceptable, as participants perceived all intervention content to be above average in helpfulness and the EMA to be highly relevant but somewhat burdensome. Participants reported that they were satisfied with the intervention and that the intervention improved their knowledge, attitudes, awareness, behavior change, intention to change, and help-seeking behavior for gambling cravings. Regarding the intervention’s feasibility, compliance rates for the EMA (51%) and EMI (15%) were low; however, the intervention was used 166 times, including 59 uses within 60 minutes of EMA completion and 107 on-demand uses. Regarding the intervention’s preliminary effectiveness, descriptive EMA data showed that, compared with the baseline period, 71% and 72% reductions in the average number of gambling episodes and craving occurrences were reported in the intervention period, respectively. In addition, clustered paired-sample two-tailed t tests revealed a significant 5.4% reduction in real-time craving intensity (P=.01) immediately after intervention use, which increased to 10.5% (P=.01), where use was recommended based on craving occurrence. At the group level, significant medium-to-large reductions were observed in mean gambling symptom severity (P=.01 and .003), cravings (P=.03 and .02), frequency (P=.01 and .004), and expenditure (P=.04 and .003) at postintervention and follow-up; moreover, increased mean gambling self-efficacy and craving self-efficacy (P=.01 and .01) were observed at postintervention and increased gambling self-efficacy (P=.04) was observed at follow-up. At the individual level, over a quarter of participants (6/22, 27% to 10/21, 48%) could be categorized as recovered or improved regarding their gambling symptom severity and cravings.


Conclusions:
The results support the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of this app-delivered EMI for preventing gambling episodes through craving management in people with gambling problems, which has implications for extending the reach of evidence-based treatment to moments of vulnerability in people’s everyday lives.

Tobacco smoking remains one of the biggest public health threats. Smartphone apps offer new promising opportunities for supporting smoking cessation in real-time. The social context of smokers has, however, been neglected in smartphone apps promoting smoking cessation. This randomized controlled trial investigates the effectiveness of a smartphone app in which smokers quit smoking with the help of a social network member.

Methods

This protocol describes the design of a single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, intensive longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Participants of this study are adult smokers who smoke at least one cigarette per day and intend to quit smoking at a self-set quit date. Blocking as means of group-balanced randomization is used to allocate participants to intervention or control conditions. Both intervention and control group use a smartphone-compatible device for measuring their daily smoking behavior objectively via exhaled carbon monoxide. In addition, the intervention group is instructed to use the SmokeFree Buddy app, a multicomponent app that also facilitates smoking-cessation specific social support from a buddy over a smartphone application. All participants fill out a baseline diary for three consecutive days and are invited to the lab for a background assessment. They subsequently participate in an end-of-day diary phase from 7 days before and until 20 days after a self-set quit date. Six months after the self-set quit date a follow-up diary for three consecutive days takes place. The primary outcome measures are daily self-reported and objectively-assessed smoking abstinence and secondary outcome measures are daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked.

Discussion

This is the first study examining the effectiveness of a smoking cessation mobile intervention using the SmokeFree Buddy app compared to a control group in a real-life setting around a self-set quit date using a portable objective measure to assess smoking abstinence. Opportunities and challenges with running studies with smoking participants and certain design-related decisions are discussed.

Abstract
Background

Tailoring healthcare to patients’ individual needs is a central goal of precision medicine. Combining smartphone-based interventions with machine learning approaches may help attaining this goal. The aim of our study was to explore the predictability of the success of smartphone-based psychotherapeutic micro-interventions in eliciting mood changes using machine learning.

Methods

Participants conducted daily smartphone-based psychotherapeutic micro-interventions, guided by short video clips, for 13 consecutive days. Participants chose one of four intervention techniques used in psychotherapeutic approaches. Mood changes were assessed using the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire. Micro-intervention success was predicted using random forest (RF) tree-based mixed-effects logistic regression models. Data from 27 participants were used, totaling 324 micro-interventions, randomly split 100 times into training and test samples, using within-subject and between-subject sampling.

Results

Mood improved from pre- to post-intervention in 137 sessions (initial success-rate: 42.3%). The RF approach resulted in predictions of micro-intervention success significantly better than the initial success-rate within and between subjects (positive predictive value: 0.732 (95%-CI: 0.607; 0.820) and 0.698 (95%-CI: 0.564; 0.805), respectively). Prediction quality was highest using the RF approach within subjects (rand accuracy: 0.75 (95%-CI: 0.641; 0.840), Matthew's correlation coefficient: 0.483 (95%-CI: 0.323; 0.723)).

Limitations

The RF approach does not allow firm conclusions about the exact contribution of each factor to the algorithm's predictions. We included a limited number of predictors and did not compare whether predictability differed between psychotherapeutic techniques.

Conclusions

Our findings may pave the way for translation and encourage scrutinizing personalized prediction in the psychotherapeutic context to improve treatment efficacy.",https://edoc.unibas.ch/82331/1/Dissertation_Esther_Stalujanis.pdf#page=58,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:xJYe7wJI7jkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
Digital interventions offer new avenues for low-threshold prevention and treatment in young people. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) represent a powerful approach that allows for adaptive, real-time, and real-world delivery of intervention components in daily life by real-time processing of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. Compassion-focused interventions (CFIs) may be particularly amenable to translation into an EMI to strengthen emotional resilience and modify putative risk mechanisms, such as stress sensitivity, in the daily lives of young help-seeking individuals.


Objective:
This study aims to investigate the feasibility, safety, and initial therapeutic effects of a novel, accessible, transdiagnostic, ecological momentary CFI for improving emotional resilience to stress (EMIcompass).


Methods:
In this uncontrolled pilot study, help-seeking youth with psychotic, depressive, or anxiety symptoms were offered the EMIcompass intervention in addition to treatment as usual. The EMIcompass intervention consisted of a 3-week EMI (including enhancing, consolidating, and EMA-informed interactive tasks) administered through a mobile health app and three face-to-face sessions with a trained psychologist intended to provide guidance and training on the CFI exercises presented in the app (ie, training session, follow-up booster session, and review session).


Results:
In total, 10 individuals (mean age 20.3 years, SD 3.8; range 14-25) were included in the study. Most (8/10, 80%) participants were satisfied and reported a low burden of app usage. No adverse events were observed. In approximately one-third of all EMAs, individuals scored high on stress, negative affect, or threat anticipation during the intervention period, resulting in real-time, interactive delivery of the CFI intervention components in addition to weekly enhancing and daily consolidating tasks. Although the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size, reduced stress sensitivity, momentary negative affect, and psychotic experiences, along with increased positive affect, were found at postintervention and the 4-week follow-up. Furthermore, reductions in psychotic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were found (r=0.30-0.65).


Conclusions:
Our findings provide evidence on the feasibility and safety of the EMIcompass intervention for help-seeking youth and lend initial support to beneficial effects on stress sensitivity and mental health outcomes. An exploratory randomized controlled trial is warranted to establish the feasibility and preliminary evidence of its efficacy.

Abstract

Purpose

The Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) concept was the basis for developing a smartphone application for the on-time report of awake bruxism (AB) activities. This study aims to monitor AB report over time in a population of healthy young adults.

Methods

A population of young adults recruited among dental students in good general health was recruited. All answered to a questionnaire, including the Oral Behavior Checklist (OBC-1). They were then monitored with a smartphone application for AB report during seven consecutive days and completed three further observation periods (EMA-1, 2 and 3) at one-month intervals. After the third period (EMA-3), participants answered again the OBC questionnaire (OBC-2). Changes over time were described, and Pearson Correlation test was performed to assess the correlation between EMA and OBC items reports. A significance level of p = .01 was set.

Results

Thirty-one University students completed the study protocol. Answers to the OBC showed an increase in the prevalence of self-reported bracing and teeth clenching from the first to second report (38.7%–54.8% and 77.4%–90.3%, respectively). A slight increase in the ‘relaxed’ condition (62.5%–69.0%) was observed with EMA-based smartphone application over time. No correlation between OBC items and EMA was detected between OBC-1 and EMA-1. A moderate positive correlation in bracing report (+0.509, p = .01) and weak positive correlation in teeth contact report (+0.380, p = .05) were found between OBC-2 and EMA-3.

Conclusion

Using a smartphone-based approach to AB report may be helpful to monitor AB over time and increase an individual's awareness to recognise actions such as bracing and teeth contact concerning the single-time report.

Background:
Risky drinking is a significant public health issue in young Australian adults. Brief interventions are one of few effective methods of reducing risky drinking but are time and cost intensive; innovative methods of delivery are therefore of interest. Mobile phones offer new opportunities to collect data and intervene during risky drinking events. Mobile phones have successfully been used for delivery of alcohol-related brief interventions and data collection but not in combination with or during drinking events.


Objective:
This pilot study will investigate the efficacy of an ecological momentary intervention (EMI), with combined ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and brief intervention delivered by mobile phones to young adults during risky drinking events.


Methods:
We will use a 3-armed randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of the intervention for reducing peak single occasion drinking. Our sample is recruited from an observational cohort study of young, risky drinkers. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 3 intervention arms. On 6 nights across a 12-week study period, EMI and EMA groups will complete hourly EMA surveys on their mobile phone. EMI participants will receive tailored feedback short message service (SMS) texts corresponding to their EMA survey responses. The EMI participants will not receive feedback SMS. A third group will have no contact (no-contact control). All groups will then be contacted for a follow-up interview within 4 weeks of the 12-week study period ending.


Results:
The primary outcome is mean reduction in standard drinks consumed during their most recent heavy drinking occasion as measured at follow-up. Secondary outcomes include alcohol consumption over the previous 6 months, experiences of alcohol-related harms, attitudes toward drinking and drunkenness, hazardous drinking and use of tobacco and illicit drugs. A random effects mixed modelling approach using maximum likelihood estimation will be used to provide estimates of differences in mean drinking levels between those receiving the intervention and control participants.


Conclusions:
This study is novel in that, unlike previous work, it will intervene repeatedly during single occasion drinking events. Further, it extends previous research in this area, which has applied limited tailoring of message content for SMS-based brief interventions. The findings of this study will contribute to the growing body of evidence to inform the use of mobile health interventions for reducing alcohol consumption and harms.

Background:
The mobile phone app, TrackYourStress (TYS), is a new crowdsensing mobile health platform for ecological momentary assessments of perceived stress levels.


Objective:
In this pilot study, we aimed to investigate the time trend of stress levels while using TYS for the entire population being studied and whether the individuals’ perceived stress reactivity moderates stress level changes while using TYS.


Methods:
Using TYS, stress levels were measured repeatedly with the 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and perceived stress reactivity was measured once with the Perceived Stress Reactivity Scale (PSRS). A total of 78 nonclinical participants, who provided 1 PSRS assessment and at least 4 repeated PSS-4 measurements, were included in this pilot study. Linear multilevel models were used to analyze the time trend of stress levels and interactions with perceived stress reactivity.


Results:
Across the whole sample, stress levels did not change while using TYS (P=.83). Except for one subscale of the PSRS, interindividual differences in perceived stress reactivity did not influence the trajectories of stress levels. However, participants with higher scores on the PSRS subscale reactivity to failure showed a stronger increase of stress levels while using TYS than participants with lower scores (P=.04).


Conclusions:
TYS tracks the stress levels in daily life, and most of the results showed that stress levels do not change while using TYS. Controlled trials are necessary to evaluate whether it is specifically TYS or any other influence that worsens the stress levels of participants with higher reactivity to failure.

Adults who are homeless are more likely to have alcohol use disorders (AUDs) compared with domiciled adults. Although AUD treatments are commonly available, many factors (eg, transportation limitations and inability to schedule appointments) contribute to low treatment completion rates and low success rates of these interventions among adults experiencing homelessness. Most adults who are homeless own mobile phones; however, no interventions have been developed that use mobile devices to deliver and support AUD interventions for this population. Mobile phone–based AUD interventions may reduce barriers that have limited the use and utility of traditional interventions.


Objective:
The aim of this study is to (1) identify variables (eg, affect, stress, geolocation, and cravings) that predict drinking among homeless adults (phase I), (2) develop a mobile intervention that utilizes an algorithm to identify moments of risk for drinking and deliver treatment messages that are tailored to the individual’s current needs in real time (phase II), and (3) pilot test the intervention app (phase III).


Methods:
In phase I, adults experiencing homelessness with an AUD (N=80) will complete baseline, equipment, 2-week, and 4-week follow-up visits in person. Participants will be prompted to complete five daily ecological momentary assessments on a study-provided smartphone for 28 days. The smartphone app will collect GPS coordinates every 5 min for the entire 28-day study period. Participants will wear a transdermal alcohol sensor that will objectively measure alcohol use. In phase II, we will use phase I data to develop an algorithm that identifies moments of heightened risk for drinking and develop treatment messages that address risk factors for drinking. Phase III will pilot test the intervention in 40 adults experiencing homelessness with AUD.


Results:
This project was funded in June 2018. IRB approval was obtained in October 2018, and data collection for phase I began in February 2019. Phase III data collection is expected to conclude in 2020. To date, 80 participants have consented to the study, and data analysis for phase I will begin in early 2020.


Conclusions:
This research will highlight intervention targets and develop a novel intervention for understudied and underserved adults experiencing homelessness with AUD.

We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, 12-week, adjunctive, smartphone-assisted intervention to improve treatment adherence in bipolar disorder. Eight participants completed 4 in-person individual therapy sessions over the course of a month, followed by 60 days of twice-daily ecological momentary intervention (EMI) sessions, with a fifth in-person session after 30 days and a sixth in-person session after 60 days. Perceived credibility of the intervention and expectancy for change were adequate at baseline, and satisfaction on completion of the intervention was very high. Participants demonstrated good adherence to the intervention overall, including excellent adherence to the in-person component and fair adherence to the smartphone-facilitated component. Qualitative feedback revealed very high satisfaction with the in-person sessions and suggested a broad range of ways in which the EMI sessions were helpful. Participants also provided suggestions for improving the intervention, which primarily related to the structure and administration of the EMI (smartphone-administered) sessions. Although this study was not designed to evaluate treatment efficacy, most key outcome variables changed in the expected directions from pretreatment to posttreatment, and several variables changed significantly over the course of the in-person sessions or during the EMI phase. These findings add to the small but growing body of literature suggesting that EMIs are feasible and acceptable for use in populations with bipolar disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5119543/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:jloCqHGPGQ0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",journals.lww.com

Abstract

Experts in clinical mental health research count on personalized approaches based on self-monitoring and self-management to improve treatment efficacy in psychiatry. Among other things, researchers expect that Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) based on self-monitoring and personalized feedback will reduce depressive symptoms. Clinical trial findings have, however, been conflicting. A recent trial (ZELF-i) investigated whether depression treatment might be enhanced by an add-on EMI with self-monitoring items and feedback focused on positive affect and activities (Do-module) or on negative affect and thinking patterns (Think-module). There was no statistical evidence that this EMI impacted clinical or functional outcomes beyond the effects of regular care, regardless of module content. In apparent contrast, 86% of the participants who completed the intervention indicated they would recommend it to others. In the present study, we used in-depth interviews (n = 20) to better understand the EMI's personal and clinical benefits and downsides. A thematic analysis of the interviews generated six areas of impact with various subthemes. In line with the trial results, few participants reported behavioral changes or symptom improvement over time; the self-assessments mainly amplified momentary mood, in either direction. The most often mentioned benefits were an increase in self-awareness, insight, and self-management (e.g., a stronger sense of control over complaints). Consistently, these domains received the highest ratings in our evaluation questionnaire (n = 89). Furthermore, the EMI instilled a routine into the days of individuals without regular jobs or other activities. Participants reported few downsides. The experiences were rather similar between the two modules. This study suggests that EMI might contribute to health by helping individuals deal with their symptoms, rather than reducing them. Measures on self-awareness, insight, and self-management should be more emphatically involved in future EMI research.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782921000762,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:j43UL4pU4psJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract
Sexual assault is an unfortunately common experience among women in college campuses. This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to gain a better understanding of the contextual determinants of sexual assault among college women. EMA reports inquired about sexual assault experiences, risky sex (sex without a condom and regretted hookups), and substance use (alcohol and cannabis use), as well as what activities participants were engaged in (e.g., pregaming, drinking with peers, and drinking with a casual sexual partner), and whether they experienced peer pressure to engage in casual sex. Participants were 103 freshman undergraduate women (18–24 years old) at a Southwestern university in the United States, who were unmarried, interested in dating opposite-sex partners, engaged in binge drinking (defined as having 3 or more drinks on one occasion) in the past month, and reported at least one experience of sexual intercourse in their lifetime. Participants completed reports (one random and two time-contingent) via EMA three times a day over a 42-day period. Compliance in completing EMA reports was good (84.2% of prompted reports were completed), and time-to-completion of reports once signaled was acceptable (mean = 26 minutes, median = 5.75 minutes). During the 42 days, 40 women (38.8%) reported 75 occasions of sexual assault. The odds of experiencing sexual assault were significantly greater during occasions of regretted hookups and unprotected sex. Additionally, drinking with peers and peer pressure to engage in casual sex were each associated significantly with occasions of sexual assault. Reducing risk for sexual assault among undergraduate women may be possible by targeting these behaviors and contextual features in near real-time via momentary intervention.

Current mobile devices allow the execution of sophisticated applications with the capacity for identifying the user situation, which can be helpful in treatments of mental disorders. In this paper, we present SituMan, a solution that provides situation awareness to MoodBuster, an ecological momentary assessment and intervention mobile application used to request self-assessments from patients in depression treatments. SituMan has a fuzzy inference engine to identify patient situations using context data gathered from the sensors embedded in mobile devices. Situations are specified jointly by the patient and mental health professional, and they can represent the patient’s daily routine (e.g., “studying”, “at work”, “working out”). MoodBuster requests mental status self-assessments from patients at adequate moments using situation awareness. In addition, SituMan saves and displays patient situations in a summary, delivering them for consultation by mental health professionals. A first experimental evaluation was performed to assess the user satisfaction with the approaches to define and identify situations. This experiment showed that SituMan was well evaluated in both criteria. A second experiment was performed to assess the accuracy of the fuzzy engine to infer situations. Results from the second experiment showed that the fuzzy inference engine has a good accuracy to identify situations.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/1/127,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:OPYYei4we-MJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.mdpi.com

Abstract

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has increasingly been used to examine suicidality in naturalistic environments. Despite its potential to yield clinically relevant information, no EMA study has used an anonymous, fully online, design. This study reports on the feasibility and acceptability of real-time monitoring of suicide risk among 237 high-risk, anonymous, community-based adults (N = 237, 61.6% female, Mage = 27.12 years) who responded to six daily EMA prompts for 2 weeks. A subset (N = 69) completed a poststudy feedback survey to provide information on the acceptability of the study protocol. Response rates to EMA prompts (69.1%) demonstrated the feasibility of this design. Suicidal ideation was reported in 21.5% of prompts and by 86.1% of participants. Participants reported that their overall experience was positive, and that they would be willing to participate in a similar study again. Specific strengths and limitations of the study design were discussed in response to open-ended items. Finally, participants who created an alias email to ensure anonymity were less likely to report a suicide attempt (SA) history and more likely to complete the study. Overall, intensive EMA designs are feasible and acceptable when delivered online and to anonymous participants. Specific recommendations are provided for managing safety within these study designs, and for refinements in future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Objectives

To examine real-time relationships between social interactions and poststroke mood and somatic symptoms in participants’ daily environments.

Design

Prospective observational study using smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys 5 times a day for 2 weeks. Multilevel models were used to analyze data for concurrent and lagged associations.

Setting

Community.

Participants

Adults (N=48) with mild stroke.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

EMA measures of self-appraisal of social interactions (confidence, satisfaction, and success), as well as mood (depression and anxiety) and somatic (pain and fatigue) symptoms.

Results

In concurrent associations, increased depressed mood was associated with reduced ratings of all aspects of social interactions. Fatigue was associated with reduced ratings of social satisfaction and success. In lagged associations, increased anxious mood preceded increased subsequent social confidence. Higher average social satisfaction, confidence, and success were related to lower momentary fatigue, anxious mood, and depressed mood at the next time point. Regarding clinicodemographic factors, being employed was concurrently related to increased social interactions. An increased number of comorbidities predicted higher somatic, but not mood, symptoms at the next time point.

Conclusions

This study provides preliminary evidence of dynamic relationships between social interactions and somatic and mood symptoms in individuals with mild stroke. Interventions to not only address the sequelae of symptoms, but also to promote participation in social activities in poststroke life should be explored.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8168278/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:tDl4xKtmbgUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

•

Emerging evidence supports the use of “just-in-time” micro-interventions for depression, however it remains unclear which features of such interventions have contributed to symptom improvement.

•

We evaluated three levels of features of micro-interventions against a wait-list control: mood tracking, mood tracking + content, mood tracking + content + just-in-time prompts.

•

Immediate improvements in mood were observed in micro-intervention content conditions, along with greater improvements in depressive and automatic negative symptoms.

•

The addition of just-in-time prompts to the micro-intervention did not appear to improve efficacy, contrary to expectation.

•

Our findings strengthen the evidence for micro-interventions, and have important implications for their effective design.

Abstract
Background

Technological advancements make it possible to deliver depression interventions via smartphone applications (“Apps”), including those that deliver content “just-in-time” (e.g., in response to acute negative mood states). This study examined whether an app-based just-in-time intervention (ImproveYourMood+) decreased depressive symptoms, and whether the following features were related to symptom improvement: micro-intervention content, mood monitoring, and just-in-time prompts to use content.

Methods

Participants (n = 235) from the general population who self-identified as wanting to improve their negative mood were randomised to a waitlist control group (n = 55) or one of three intervention groups: MoodTracker (monitoring-only, n = 58), ImproveYourMood (monitoring and content; n = 62), or ImproveYourMood+ (monitoring, content, and prompts; n = 60). The active intervention phase was 3 weeks. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, and negative automatic thoughts were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and one month following post-intervention.

Results

Linear mixed modelling revealed greater declines over time in depressive and anxiety symptoms and negative automatic thoughts for the ImproveYourMood group (standardized mean differences [SMDs] ranged from .32 to .40) and improves for the ImproveYourMood+ group for negative automatic thoughts (SMDs ≥ .37) compared to the waitlist control group. No between-group differences were observed between the MoodTracker and control groups (SMDs = .04–.23). User experience appeared to be superior in more comprehensive/multi-modal versions.

Limitations

The study employed a naturalistic design, whereby participants self-selected to utilise the program, did not complete eligibility assessments, and did not receive compensation. The study therefore attained considerable drop-out rate (~50% by the follow-up timepoints), potentially reflecting the usage patterns of real-world mental health apps.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that micro-interventions can be an effective way to reduce depressive symptoms both in the moment and 1–2 months later. Integration of micro-interventions with full treatment programs is a viable next step in micro-intervention research.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Dh527JhJORAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Targeting low self-esteem in youth exposed to childhood adversity is a promising strategy for preventing adult mental disorder, but psychological help remains difficult to access and accept for youth, calling for novel, youth-friendly approaches. Mobile Health (mHealth) and, most prominently, ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) provide a unique opportunity to deliver youth-friendly, personalized, real-time, guided self-help interventions. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a novel, accessible, transdiagnostic ecological momentary intervention for improving self-esteem (‘SELFIE’) in youth with prior exposure to childhood adversity.

Methods/design

In a parallel-group, assessor-blind, multi-center randomized controlled trial, individuals aged 12–26 years with prior exposure to childhood adversity and low self-esteem will be randomly allocated to SELFIE in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) as the experimental condition or the control condition of TAU only, which will include access to all standard health care. SELFIE is a digital guided self-help intervention administered through a smartphone-based app to allow for interactive, personalized, real-time and real-world transfer of intervention components in individuals’ daily lives, blended with three training sessions delivered by trained mental health professionals over a 6-week period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up by blinded assessors. The primary outcome will be the level of self-esteem as measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).

Discussion

The current study is the first to establish the efficacy of an EMI focusing on improving self-esteem transdiagnostically in youth exposed to childhood adversity. If this trial provides evidence on the efficacy of SELFIE, it has significant potential to contribute to minimizing the deleterious impact of childhood adversity and, thereby, preventing the development of mental disorder later in life.

ABSTRACT

Smartphone apps are suitable for delivering mental health treatment in real-time. This study aimed to develop and test the usability of one of the first smartphone app-delivered ecological momentary interventions for gambling (GamblingLess: Curb Your Urge), with key Australian stakeholders (ten consumers, nine gambling clinicians, and ten gambling researchers). Based on relapse prevention principles, the intervention comprised 10 activities to curb cravings, which were recommended to participants based on ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of gambling cravings. Participants tested the usability of the intervention over one-week and reported on the content’s helpfulness, the EMA’s relevance/burden, the Mobile App Rating Scale, and open-ended items assessing content and functionality. The intervention content, helpfulness, and usability were rated highly in quantitative and qualitative assessments. Participants liked practical and instructive content, but suggested that the intervention could be more engaging, interactive, and varied, and the number of EMA questions per timepoint could be reduced. These preliminary findings were promising for the intervention’s acceptability and usability. All groups indicated that they would recommend this app, as it could increase knowledge, attitudes, awareness, behavior change, intention to change, and help-seeking for gambling cravings. Further research is required to refine the intervention and examine its effectiveness with gamblers.

Background:
Smartphone self-monitoring of mood, symptoms, and contextual factors through ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides insights into the daily lives of people undergoing psychiatric treatment. Therefore, EMA has the potential to improve their care. To integrate EMA into treatment, a clinical tool that helps clients and clinicians create personalized EMA diaries and interpret the gathered data is needed.


Objective:
This study aimed to develop a web-based application for personalized EMA in specialized psychiatric care in close collaboration with all stakeholders (ie, clients, clinicians, researchers, and software developers).


Methods:
The participants were 52 clients with mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders and 45 clinicians (psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses). We engaged them in interviews, focus groups, and usability sessions to determine the requirements for an EMA web application and repeatedly obtained feedback on iteratively improved high-fidelity EMA web application prototypes. We used human-centered design principles to determine important requirements for the web application and designed high-fidelity prototypes that were continuously re-evaluated and adapted.


Results:
The iterative development process resulted in Personalized Treatment by Real-time Assessment (PETRA), which is a scientifically grounded web application for the integration of personalized EMA in Dutch clinical care. PETRA includes a decision aid to support clients and clinicians with constructing personalized EMA diaries, an EMA diary item repository, an SMS text message–based diary delivery system, and a feedback module for visualizing the gathered EMA data. PETRA is integrated into electronic health record systems to ensure ease of use and sustainable integration in clinical care and adheres to privacy regulations.


Conclusions:
PETRA was built to fulfill the needs of clients and clinicians for a user-friendly and personalized EMA tool embedded in routine psychiatric care. PETRA is unique in this codevelopment process, its extensive but user-friendly personalization options, its integration into electronic health record systems, its transdiagnostic focus, and its strong scientific foundation in the design of EMA diaries and feedback. The clinical effectiveness of integrating personalized diaries via PETRA into care requires further research. As such, PETRA paves the way for a systematic investigation of the utility of personalized EMA for routine mental health care.

Background

Stress, and specifically perseverative cognition, is considered to have considerable detrimental effects on mental and physical health. Interventions that can offer temporary stress relief could, therefore, bring considerable health benefits. Previous research has pointed to stress-reducing effects of exposure to nature after acute stressors, but has not yet investigated effects in the realm of everyday life. The present pilot study explores whether an ecological momentary intervention using exposure to natural images could be effective in lowering stress and improve mood.

Methods

Fifteen participants (12 females) scoring above threshold on stress, depression, or anxiety completed two study periods of 6 days. They watched an urban (control) or natural slideshow twice daily. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment, effects on mood, and stress-related complaints were measured in everyday life.

Results

Compliance to the study protocol was high, especially in the first week, with slightly more videos watched in the morning than in the evening. We found indications of improvements in mood, self-reported worrying (but not stress levels), and heart rate.

Conclusions

The results suggest that twice-daily exposure to restorative visual content could be a viable Ecological Momentary Intervention, with the potential to reduce self-reported worry, lower autonomic activity, and increase positive affect.",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Femke_Beute/publication/324913367_Stopping_the_Train_of_Thought_A_Pilot_Study_Using_an_Ecological_Momentary_Intervention_with_Twice-Daily_Exposure_to_Natural_versus_Urban_Scenes_to_Lower_Stress_and_Rumination/links/5d1ce507458515c11c0f5ed8/Stopping-the-Train-of-Thought-A-Pilot-Study-Using-an-Ecological-Momentary-Intervention-with-Twice-Daily-Exposure-to-Natural-versus-Urban-Scenes-to-Lower-Stress-and-Rumination.pdf?origin=journalDetail&_tp=eyJwYWdlIjoiam91cm5hbERldGFpbCJ9,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:8gjAi2QVWOEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com

ABSTRACT

This systematic review synthesized evidence from ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies examining associations between external contexts (social, physical, or time-based) and everyday movement behaviors in children and adults. Published English articles were searched in multiple databases and assessed for methodological quality. The 29 eligible EMA studies differed in their sample size, EMA design, and activity measures. Available evidence indicated that specific external contexts may play a role in shaping individuals’ everyday movement behaviors. For social contexts, the presence of others or recent interaction with others was related to more physical activity and less sedentary time. For physical contexts, there were consistent findings suggesting that staying outdoors (vs. indoors) was related to increased physical activity and decreased sedentary behavior. For time-based contexts, time of day or weekend (vs. weekday) influence on movement behaviors was not consistent. Favorable weather conditions were associated with greater physical activity, while poor weather conditions were conducive to sedentary behavior. The influence of other social, physical, and time-based factors on movement behaviors was mixed or inconclusive. Future EMA work should include clinical and minority populations, examine moderators and other behavior parameters, and test the potential mechanisms explaining the associations between external contexts and everyday movement behaviors.

Abstract

Background
Emerging adulthood (18–25 years) represents a risky time for mental health and substance use. Emerging adults are particularly susceptible to problematic patterns of substance use, especially if they experience anxiety and/or depression and use substances as a way to cope with such issues. However, many mental health treatments do not address substance use. We developed an ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/EMI) to specifically target the motive of drinking to cope with anxiety/depression.

Methods
Project CHOICE was a 6-week intervention that paired in-person normative feedback with daily EMA and, if an individual reported negative affect and intent to drink, an EMI was immediately sent to their phone (a personally-chosen coping skill). We recruited n = 20 (55% female, mean age 21.74, 85% Caucasian and 75% non-Hispanic/Latino) individuals from a psychiatric partial hospitalization program for a 6-week open trial of the CHOICE intervention and re-assessed at the 6-week follow-up point.

Results
Results indicated that drinking variables and coping motives were highly correlated at baseline. Days of drinking, alcohol-related problems, and coping motives significantly decreased over time following the intervention. Results indicated high levels of feasibility and acceptability.

Conclusions
This open pilot represents a feasible, acceptable, and promising direction in delivering interventions in the moment when risk is highest, utilizing smartphone capabilities.

Recognizing that mental health issues are on an alarming rise, affecting the individual and the society in a progressively multi-faceted nature, and that existing human resources are not sufficient to tackle the crisis, decision-makers have turned to technology to see what opportunities it may offer. More than ever, this endeavor has gained importance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, whose consequences not only severed the already fickle live human contact between the professionals and their patients but also onset a broad mental health crisis stemming from the virus’ impact on health and the implemented measures to control it. The role that IoT-enabled technology plays in this new landscape of digital mental health can be roughly divided into two complementary processes: assessment and intervention. Assessment concerns monitoring, learning about, and recognizing a person’s mental health issues through their physiology, behavior, thinking, emotional and cognitive states, and the context they live in. Intervention follows, and it conforms to the specifics of an assessment, attempting to effect attitude and behavior change in a person. Technology, especially artificial intelligence, enables assessment and intervention to be tailored very specifically to the individual. Omnipresent devices—e.g., smart bracelets—allow increasingly more accurate assessments, which allow not only better interventions but also interventions that can be delivered momentarily—e.g., with an intelligent cognitive assistant on a smartphone—with the continuous interchange of both as the biggest leap forward.

In this paper, we present m-Path (www.m-Path.io), an online platform that provides an easy-to-use and highly tailorable framework for implementing smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and intervention (EMI) in both research and clinical practice in the context of blended care. Because real-time monitoring and intervention in people's everyday lives have unparalleled benefits compared to traditional data collection techniques (e.g., retrospective surveys or lab-based experiments), EMA and EMI have become popular in recent years. Although a surge in the use of these methods has led to a myriad of EMA and EMI applications, many existing platforms only focus on a single aspect of daily life data collection (e.g., assessment vs. intervention, active self-report vs. passive mobile sensing, research-dedicated vs. clinically-oriented tools). With m-Path, we aim to integrate all of these facets into a single platform, as it is exactly this all-in-one approach that fosters the clinical utility of accumulated scientific knowledge. To this end, we offer a comprehensive platform to set up complex and highly adjustable EMA and EMI designs with advanced functionalities, using an intuitive point-and click web interface that is accessible for researchers and clinicians with limited programming skills. We discuss the strengths of daily life data collection and intervention in general and m-Path in particular. We describe the regular workflow to set up an EMA or EMI design within the m-Path framework, and summarize both the basic functionalities and more advanced features of our software.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1182175/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:HtA-5U6kSLsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

Abstract
Psychosocial and health behavior treatments can be extended beyond research and
clinical settings by using mobile technology to provide Ecological Momentary
Interventions [EMI] to individuals as they go about their daily lives. This study integrates
the assessment (i.e., Ecological Momentary Assessment; EMA) and intervention (i.e.,
EMI) capacities of palmtop computers to provide individually tailored EMI to
participants in real time. The feasibility and efficacy of using EMI to augment a
disordered eating treatment intervention for college women was evaluated. Participants
were randomized to view psychoeducational videos on a computer (attention control),
complete an interactive CD-ROM-based intervention aimed at reducing body
dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors (CD), or receive the CD-ROM
supplemented with EMI (CD+EMI). The content and timing of EMI was individually
tailored in real time and provided on palmtop computers for one week following the CD
intervention. Very high compliance rates with the EMA/EMI protocol were demonstrated
and women were generally satisfied with the intervention, suggesting it is feasible to
implement tailored EMI. An evaluation of treatment efficacy revealed the computerized
CD-ROM intervention did not reliably produce significant improvements in body-related
constructs and there was no unique or added benefit of EMI. This study was innovative in
that it used palmtop computers to combine ambulatory assessment and intervention
strategies to provide tailored and contextually sensitive EMI. As such, it adds to the
relatively young, but growing EMI literature by identifying challenges and opportunities
for ambulatory assessment and intervention methods in psychosocial and health behavior
treatments.

ABSTRACT

Motivated by recent advances in technologies, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) have seen a rise in behavioral medicine research that in real-time, informs the context for the behavior and prompts interventions to change that behavior in the natural setting when necessary. However, EMA and EMI have yet to be fully embraced in the field of stroke rehabilitation. Our objective is to provide a theoretically based perspective for the combined and synergistic use of EMA and EMI to promote person-centered, recovery-based durable changes in functional movement behaviors of stroke survivors. Research abounds for non-stroke populations with emerging evidence for the benefits of using real-time data capture techniques (i.e. EMA) coupled with EMI to better customize the content and timing of interventions to the inherent fluctuations in state and context that encompass the target behavior. We review existing EMA and EMI literature broadly in behavioral medicine and psychological science to identify how real-time repeated sampling technology has been used in the context of stroke rehabilitation and to delineate the pros and cons of this approach in general with non-stroke populations. We propose a coupled EMA and EMI strategy be used in conjunction with existing stroke recovery and rehabilitation practices. There is tremendous potential to effectively personalize recovery-promoting interventions to achieve durable behavior change, and importantly, shift the focus of rehabilitation practice from the health-care provider and clinical environment to the individual and their lived experience in the home and community.

Background:
Most mental disorders first emerge in youth and, in their early stages, surface as subthreshold expressions of symptoms comprising a transdiagnostic phenotype of psychosis, mania, depression, and anxiety. Elevated stress reactivity is one of the most widely studied mechanisms underlying psychotic and affective mental health problems. Thus, targeting stress reactivity in youth is a promising indicated and translational preventive strategy for adverse mental health outcomes that could develop later in life and for improving resilience. Compassion-focused interventions offer a wide range of innovative therapeutic techniques that are particularly amenable to being implemented as ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), a specific type of mobile health intervention, to enable youth to access interventions in a given moment and context in daily life. This approach may bridge the current gap in youth mental health care.


Objective:
This study aims to investigate the clinical feasibility, candidate underlying mechanisms, and initial signals of the efficacy of a novel, transdiagnostic, hybrid EMI for improving resilience to stress in youth—EMIcompass.


Methods:
In an exploratory randomized controlled trial, youth aged between 14 and 25 years with current distress, a broad Clinical High At-Risk Mental State, or the first episode of a severe mental disorder will be randomly allocated to the EMIcompass intervention (ie, EMI plus face-to-face training sessions) in addition to treatment as usual or a control condition of treatment as usual only. Primary (stress reactivity) and secondary candidate mechanisms (resilience, interpersonal sensitivity, threat anticipation, negative affective appraisals, and momentary physiological markers of stress reactivity), as well as primary (psychological distress) and secondary outcomes (primary psychiatric symptoms and general psychopathology), will be assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at the 4-week follow-up.


Results:
The first enrollment was in August 2019, and as of May 2021, enrollment and randomization was completed (N=92). We expect data collection to be completed by August 2021.


Conclusions:
This study is the first to establish feasibility, evidence on underlying mechanisms, and preliminary signals of the efficacy of a compassion-focused EMI in youth. If successful, a confirmatory randomized controlled trial will be warranted. Overall, our approach has the potential to significantly advance preventive interventions in youth mental health provision.

Severe mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and other psychotic-spectrum disorders, are a major cause of disability worldwide. Although efficacious pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have been developed for treating patients with schizophrenia, relapse rates are high and long-term recovery remains elusive for many individuals. Furthermore, little is still known about the underlying mechanisms of these illnesses. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the contextual factors that contribute to psychosis so that they can be better targeted in future interventions. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a dynamic procedure that permits the measurement of variables in natural settings in real-time through the use of brief assessments delivered via mobile electronic devices (i.e., smartphones). One advantage of EMA is that it is less subject to retrospective memory biases and highly sensitive to fluctuating environmental factors. In the current article, we describe the research-to-date using EMA to better understand fluctuating symptoms and functioning in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and potential applications to treatment. In addition, we describe a novel EMA protocol that we have been employing to study the outcomes of patients with schizophrenia following a hospital discharge.

Depressed young women are at increased risk for adverse outcomes related to sexual behavior, including unintended pregnancy, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections. Brief sexual risk reduction interventions have not targeted depressed young women's specific needs for affect management and impulse control.

Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures

We interviewed depressed young women ages 15-23 years engaging in sexual risk behavior about a proposed intervention approach. The approach was described as in-person counseling and cognitive-behavioral skills training, followed by an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) delivered via smartphone application for 4 weeks. The EMI would include reporting multiple times a day on affective states, self-efficacy for safer sex behavior, and sexual behavior, and receiving responsive messages to provide support and prompt use of cognitive-behavioral skills. Participants provided their perspectives on comfort, usability, burden, confidentiality, and potential efficacy of the EMI and recommended message content. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results

Thematic saturation was reached with 16 interviews. Participants expressed positive opinions about the EMI. They believed that reporting at random times would help them to recognize their feelings, receiving the messages would be reassuring, and overall the smartphone application would be experienced as therapeutic. They desired a high degree of personalization of the message quality, style, and voice, and provided a wide variety of message content.

Conclusion

Depressed young women believed that a flexible, personalized approach to mobile momentary intervention for addressing the link between their symptoms and behavior would be acceptable, supportive, and effective in reducing sexual risk.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:_om6pKIc0joJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

ABSTRACT

Background: Emerging adulthood is a critical period for the onset of both mental health disorders and problematic alcohol use. Coping strategies can play an important role in mitigating the onset and progression of these conditions in emerging adulthood. The current study examined daily mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use during an individualized, ecological momentary intervention (EMI).Objectives: To examine the within-person relationship between mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use.Methods: Emerging adults (N = 20, 55% female) in a partial hospital program for anxiety or mood disorders who endorsed drinking to cope completed a 6-week EMI to increase non-substance coping skills. The study also measured mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use over the course of the intervention.Results: Mood and coping variables did not predict the likelihood of drinking on a given day. On drinking days, the number of pre-consumption coping strategies were related to reduced alcohol use (p =.02) and there was a significant interaction between negative mood and coping in predicting alcohol use (p <.01). When pre-consumption negative mood was high, coping strategies predicted decreased alcohol use (p =.02), but when negative mood was low, this relationship was nonsignificant.Conclusions: Using coping skills was associated with reduced alcohol use on days when negative mood was high. Increasing non-substance coping skills may help emerging adults reduce their alcohol use in response to negative mood.

Abstract
Introduction

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) allows for assessment of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use in real-time. This EMA study aimed to 1) describe study participation rates; 2) evaluate the concordance of EMA and survey items measuring frequency and quantity of ENDS use; and 3) assess the relationships between EMA items measuring frequency and quantity of ENDS use with ENDS dependence, measured at baseline and with saliva cotinine collected at follow-up.

Methods

Fifty young adult ENDS users completed baseline surveys, EMAs (i.e., random, event-based, daily diaries), and follow-up questionnaires over a 14-day period. Spearman correlations were conducted to determine concordance of survey items. Linear regression models assessed the relationships between EMA ENDS use characteristics (e.g., puffs, number of days used, quantity of e-liquid) with dependence items at baseline and saliva cotinine at follow-up.

Results

Overall completion for the prompted EMAs (random and daily diaries) was 68%. Correlations between EMA measures assessing ENDS use ranged from weak (ρ = −0.02; NS) to strong (ρ = 0.69, p < .001); EMA to follow-up items ranged from weak (ρ = 0.16; p < .05) to moderate (ρ = 0.54; p < .001). Significant associations were found between ENDS use measured via random and daily diary EMAs and saliva cotinine at follow-up after controlling for cigarette smoking (B = 0.70–1.76; p < .01), but not for event-based EMAs. Items measuring frequency/quantity of use from random EMAs were consistently associated with ENDS dependence at baseline (B = 0.74–1.58; p < .01).

Conclusion

EMA represents a promising methodology to capture real-time ENDS use behaviors, primarily through daily diary and random EMAs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364672/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:LsfSczv-lWcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
Eating behavior has a high impact on the well-being of an individual. Such behavior involves not only when an individual is eating, but also various contextual factors such as with whom and where an individual is eating and what kind of food the individual is eating. Despite the relevance of such factors, most automated eating detection systems are not designed to capture contextual factors.


Objective:
The aims of this study were to (1) design and build a smartwatch-based eating detection system that can detect meal episodes based on dominant hand movements, (2) design ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questions to capture meal contexts upon detection of a meal by the eating detection system, and (3) validate the meal detection system that triggers EMA questions upon passive detection of meal episodes.


Methods:
The meal detection system was deployed among 28 college students at a US institution over a period of 3 weeks. The participants reported various contextual data through EMAs triggered when the eating detection system correctly detected a meal episode. The EMA questions were designed after conducting a survey study with 162 students from the same campus. Responses from EMAs were used to define exclusion criteria.


Results:
Among the total consumed meals, 89.8% (264/294) of breakfast, 99.0% (406/410) of lunch, and 98.0% (589/601) of dinner episodes were detected by our novel meal detection system. The eating detection system showed a high accuracy by capturing 96.48% (1259/1305) of the meals consumed by the participants. The meal detection classifier showed a precision of 80%, recall of 96%, and F1 of 87.3%. We found that over 99% (1248/1259) of the detected meals were consumed with distractions. Such eating behavior is considered “unhealthy” and can lead to overeating and uncontrolled weight gain. A high proportion of meals was consumed alone (680/1259, 54.01%). Our participants self-reported 62.98% (793/1259) of their meals as healthy. Together, these results have implications for designing technologies to encourage healthy eating behavior.


Conclusions:
The presented eating detection system is the first of its kind to leverage EMAs to capture the eating context, which has strong implications for well-being research. We reflected on the contextual data gathered by our system and discussed how these insights can be used to design individual-specific interventions.

Objective

To determine the momentary effect of social-cognitive factors, in addition to motor capability, on post-stroke paretic arm/hand use in the natural environment.

Design

A 5-day observational study in which participants were sent 6 Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) prompts/day.

Setting

Participants’ daily environment.

Participants

Community-dwelling, chronic stroke survivors with right-dominant, mild-moderate upper extremity paresis (N=30).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Time duration of bimanual and unimanual paretic arm/hand use indexed by accelerometry; social-cognitive factors (social context, self-efficacy, mood) captured by EMA; motor capability of the paretic limb measured by Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Assessment (FM).

Results

After accounting for participants’ motor capability, we found that momentary social context (alone or not) and self-efficacy significantly predicted post-stroke paretic arm/hand use behavior in the natural environment. When participants were not alone, paretic arm/hand movement increased both with and without the less-paretic limb (bimanual and unimanual movements, P=.018 and P<.001, respectively). Importantly, participants were more likely to use their paretic arm/hand (unimanually) if they had greater self-efficacy for limb use (P=.042). EMA repeated-measures provide a real-time approach that captures the natural dynamic ebb and flow of social-cognitive factors and their effect on daily arm/hand use. We also observed that people with greater motor impairments (FM<50.6) increase unimanual paretic arm/hand movements when they are not alone, regardless of motor capability.

Conclusions

In addition to motor capability, stroke survivors’ momentary social context and self-efficacy play a role in paretic arm/hand use behavior. Our findings suggest the development of personalized rehabilitative interventions which target these factors to promote daily paretic arm/hand use. This study highlights the benefits of EMA to provide real-time information to unravel the complexities of the biopsychosocial (ie, motor capability and social-cognitive factors) interface in post-stroke upper extremity recovery.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:lSx9YJb3lX4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

•

Participants who heard voices found smartphone-based monitoring and coping prompts helpful in supporting face-to-face therapy

•

Monitoring symptoms in everyday life aided communication with the therapist, promoting efficiency and empathy

•

Smartphone notifications made participants feel more connected to their therapist, deepening the therapeutic relationship

Abstract

This study explored participants' experiences of a novel intervention blending ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I) digital technologies with four face-to-face therapy sessions to improve coping in people who experience persisting auditory verbal hallucinations (hear voices). A smartphone app was used to deliver prompts to facilitate both self-monitoring and self-management of voices. Analysis of data recorded by the app was also used in-session to develop an idiographic formulation of antecedents of and responses to voice-hearing episodes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 participants who completed the blended therapy. A thematic approach was used to analyse the data, generating four main themes, with associated subthemes: (1) Therapy experience changed by digital technology; (2) Valuing face-to-face component; (3) Preference for different phases of the digital technology; (4) Not as bothered by voices. Key findings revealed that participants perceived EMA/I technology as helping capture their experience more accurately and communicate this more effectively to the therapist, which, in combination with coping prompts developed in-session, deepened the therapeutic relationship. These findings add to the emerging literature that shows blended therapy can play an important role in the treatment of people with psychosis, and suggest potential of EMA/I as a technology for other clinical populations.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782919300557,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:JXJMy1UPtRcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract

Smoking cessation treatments that are easily accessible and deliver intervention content at vulnerable moments (e.g., high negative affect) have great potential to impact tobacco abstinence. The current study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for smoking cessation. Daily smokers interested in quitting were consented to participate in a 6-week cessation study. Visit 1 occurred 4 days pre-quit, Visit 2 was on the quit day, Visit 3 occurred 3 days post-quit, Visit 4 was 10 days post-quit, and Visit 5 was 28 days post-quit. During the first 2 weeks (Visits 1–4), the JITAI delivered brief mindfulness/motivational strategies via smartphone in real-time based on negative affect or smoking behavior detected by wearable sensors. Participants also attended 5 in-person visits, where brief cessation counseling (Visits 1–4) and nicotine replacement therapy (Visits 2–5) were provided. Outcomes were feasibility and acceptability; biochemically-confirmed abstinence was also measured. Participants (N = 43) were 58.1 % female (AgeMean = 49.1, mean cigarettes per day = 15.4). Retention through follow-up was high (83.7 %). For participants with available data (n = 38), 24 (63 %) met the benchmark for sensor wearing, among whom 16 (67 %) completed at least 60 % of strategies. Perceived ease of wearing sensors (Mean = 5.1 out of 6) and treatment satisfaction (Mean = 3.6 out of 4) were high. Biochemically-confirmed abstinence was 34 % at Visit 4 and 21 % at Visit 5. Overall, the feasibility of this novel multi-component intervention for smoking cessation was mixed but acceptability was high. Future studies with improved technology will decrease participant burden and better detect key intervention moments.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S0306460322002337,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:xlscoXXVSiUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
The natural integration of mobile phones into the daily routines of families provides novel opportunities to study and support family functioning and the quality of interactions between family members in real time.


Objective:
This study aimed to examine user experiences of feasibility, acceptability, and reactivity (ie, changes in awareness and behaviors) of using a smartphone app for self-monitoring of family functioning with 36 participants across 15 family dyads and triads of young adolescents aged 10 to 14 years and their parents.


Methods:
Participants were recruited from 2 family wellness centers in a middle-to-upper income shopping area and a low-income school site. Participants were instructed and prompted by alarms to complete ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) by using a smartphone app over 2 weeks 4 times daily (upon waking in the morning, afternoon, early evening, and end of day at bedtime). The domains assessed included parental monitoring and positive parenting, parent involvement and discipline, parent-child conflict and resolution, positive interactions and support, positive and negative affect, sleep, stress, family meals, and general child and family functioning. Qualitative interviews assessed user experiences generally and with prompts for positive and negative feedback.


Results:
The participants were primarily white and Latino of mixed-income- and education levels. Children were aged 10 to 14 years, and parents had a mean age of 45 years (range 37-50). EMA response rates were high (95% to over 100%), likely because of cash incentives for EMA completion, engaging content per user feedback, and motivated sample from recruitment sites focused on social-emotional programs for family wellness. Some participants responded for up to 19 days, consistent with some user experience interview feedback of desires to continue participation for up to 3 or 4 weeks. Over 80% (25/31) of participants reported increased awareness of their families’ daily routines and functioning of their families. Most also reported positive behavior changes in the following domains: decision making, parental monitoring, quantity and quality of time together, communication, self-regulation of stress and conflict, discipline, and sleep.


Conclusions:
The results of this study support the feasibility and acceptability of using smartphone EMA by young adolescents and parents for assessing and self-monitoring family daily routines and interactions. The findings also suggest that smartphone self-monitoring may be a useful tool to support improvement in family functioning through functions of reflection on antecedents and consequences of situations, prompting positive and negative alternatives, seeding goals, and reinforcement by self-tracking for self-correction and self-rewards. Future studies should include larger samples with more diverse and higher-risk populations, longer study durations, the inclusion of passive phone sensors and peripheral biometric devices, and integration with counseling and parenting interventions and programs.

Independent practice of cognitive behavioral therapy skills improves outcomes.

Abstract

The practice of therapeutic skills outside of sessions in which they are learned is one presumed key component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Yet, our understanding of how skills practice relates to clinical outcomes remains limited. Here, we explored patients’ emotional responses to CBT skills practice in a pilot study pairing smartphone-app-delivered skills reminders and guided practice (ecological momentary intervention [EMI]) using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (n = 25) were adults recently hospitalized for a suicide attempt or severe suicidal thinking. They received brief inpatient CBT (1 to 3 sessions covering core CBT skills from the Unified Protocol), followed by 1 month of EMI and EMA after discharge. On average, participants reported modest reductions in negative affect after skills use (i.e., immediate responses; median time elapsed = 4.30 minutes). Additionally, participants tended to report less negative affect when the timepoint preceding the current assessment included EMI skills practice, rather than EMA alone (i.e., delayed responses; median time elapsed between prompts = 2.17 hours). Immediate effects were unrelated to longer-term clinical outcomes, whereas greater delayed effects were associated with lower symptom severity at follow-up. Future studies should further examine how CBT skills use in daily life may alleviate symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8891654/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1RSUoniRiLEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract

Background 

This study reviews the evidence on ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) for managing and preventing suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Methods 

This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Its protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database. We conducted a systematic literature search of five databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane library. The most recent search date was 10 September 2021.

Results 

After screening and full-text review, 27 studies were included, totaling 19 different interventions. Many of the available interventions have not yet been clinically tested. Those that have undergone effectiveness evaluation (10 interventions) showed good rates of effectiveness and feasibility, with some exceptions. The most widely used intervention model is the safety plan, which allows the user to implement coping and distracting strategies in case of suicidal ideation.

Conclusions 

Ecological momentary interventions provide certain advantages, such as their wide availability, versatility, and potential for customization. These interventions can be useful complements to traditional care, especially in situations in which face-to-face care is not possible. Evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions is still scarce. Furthermore, barriers limiting implementation in clinical practice remain. The constant advance of technology means that these interventions have great potential for improvement in the coming years.

Summary

We provide an overview of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods for the psychosocial study of health. We first present historical underpinnings and key defining characteristics of EMA followed by a description of the most prominent advantages of EMA over traditional retrospective assessments, several measurement considerations, and a discussion of sampling approaches. Examples of promising EMA applications are presented, including the study of social behavior and interpersonal dyadic processes, EMA's ability to augment routine clinical practice, the study of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and therapeutic avenues for EMA-based treatment delivery through ecological momentary interventions (EMI). We conclude this chapter with future directions for EMA methods.

Background:
The transition from high school to college can exacerbate mental health problems in young adults yet barriers prevent seamless mental health care. Existing digital support tools show promise but are not yet designed to optimize engagement or implementation.


Objective:
The goal of the research was to test acceptability and effects of an automated digital Mobile Support Tool for Mental Health (MoST-MH) for young adults transitioning to college.


Methods:
Youths aged 18 years and older with a current mental health diagnosis preparing to transition to college (n=52; 85% female [45/52], 91% White [48/52]) were recruited from a primary care (n=31) and a mental health clinic (n=21). Participants were randomized 2:1 to either receive MoST-MH (n=34) or enhanced Usual Care (eUC; n=18). MoST-MH included periodic text message and web-based check-ins of emotional health, stressors, negative impacts, and self-efficacy that informed tailored self-care support messages. Both eUC and MoST-MH participants received links to a library of psychoeducational videos and were asked to complete web-based versions of the Mental Health Self-Efficacy Scale (MHSES), College Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms (CCAPS), and Client Service Receipt Inventory for Mental Health (C-SRI) monthly for 3 months and the Post-Study System Usability Scale (PSSUQ) at 3-months.


Results:
MoST-MH participants were sent a median of 5 (range 3 to 10) text message check-in prompts over the 3-month study period and 100% were completed; participants were sent a median of 2 (range 1 to 8) web-based check-in prompts among which 78% (43/55) were completed. PSSUQ scores indicate high usability (mean score 2.0). Results from the completer analysis demonstrated reductions in mental health symptoms over time and significant between-group effects of MoST-MH compared to eUC on depressive symptom severity (d=0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.64). No significant differences in mental health self-efficacy or mental health health care use were observed.


Conclusions:
In this pilot trial, we found preliminary evidence that MoST-MH was engaged with at high rates and found to be highly usable and reduced depression symptoms relative to eUC among youth with mental health disorders transitioning to college. Findings were measured during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the study was not powered to detect differences in outcomes between groups; therefore, further testing is needed.

Little is known about whether brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) yield clinically beneficial effects. This gap exists despite the rapid growth of smartphone mindfulness applications. Specifically, no prior brief MEMI has targeted generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Moreover, although theories propose that MEMIs can boost executive functioning (EF), they have largely gone untested. Thus, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to address these gaps by assessing the efficacy of a 14-day smartphone MEMI (versus self-monitoring placebo [SMP]).

Method

Participants with GAD were randomly assigned to either condition (68 MEMI and 42 SMP). MEMI participants exercised multiple core mindfulness strategies and were instructed to practice mindfulness continually. Comparatively, SMP participants were prompted to practice self-monitoring and were not taught any mindfulness strategies. All prompts occurred five times a day for 14 consecutive days. Participants completed self-reports and neuropsychological assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU). Piecewise hierarchical linear modeling analyses were conducted.

Results

MEMI (versus SMP) produced greater pre-1MFU reductions in GAD severity and perseverative cognitions (between-group d = 0.393–0.394) and stronger improvements in trait mindfulness and performance-based inhibition (d = 0.280–0.303). Further, MEMI (versus SMP) led to more considerable pre- to posttreatment reduction in state-level depression and anxiety and more mindfulness gains (d = 0.50–1.13). Overall, between-treatment effects were stronger at pre-1MFU than pre- to posttreatment for trait-level than state-level treatment outcome measures.

Conclusions

Preliminary findings suggest that the beneficial effect of an unguided brief MEMI to target pathological worry, trait mindfulness, and EF is modest yet potentially meaningful. Other theoretical and clinical implications were discussed.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/F8E9EB26F8FE937ACCE1F87842A748ED/S0924933823000020a.pdf/div-class-title-a-randomized-controlled-trial-of-a-14-day-mindfulness-ecological-momentary-intervention-memi-for-generalized-anxiety-disorder-div.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:ybwwt0etBvoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.cambridge.org

Abstract

Objective

Scan-related anxiety (“scanxiety”) refers to the fear, stress, and anxiety in anticipation of tests and scans in follow-up cancer care. This study assessed the feasibility of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for real-world, real-time capture of scanxiety using patients' personal smartphone.

Methods

Adolescent and Young Adult survivors of childhood cancer were prompted to complete EMA surveys on a smartphone app three times per day for 11 days (33 surveys total) around their routine surveillance scans. Participants provided structured feedback on the EMA protocol.

Results

Thirty out of 46 contacted survivors (65%) enrolled, exceeding the preregistered feasibility cutoff of 55%. The survey completion rate (83%) greatly exceeded the preregistered feasibility cutoff of 65%. Participants generally found the smartphone app easy and enjoyable to use and reported low levels of distress from answering surveys. Participants reported significantly more daily fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and negative affect in the days before compared to the days after surveillance scans, aligning with the expected trajectory of scanxiety. Participants who reported greater FCR and scanxiety using comprehensive measures at baseline also reported significantly more daily FCR around their surveillance scans, indicating validity of EMA items. Bodily threat monitoring was prospectively and concurrently associated with daily FCR, thus warranting further investigation as a risk factor for scanxiety.

Conclusions

Findings indicate the feasibility, acceptability, and validity of EMA as a research tool to capture the dynamics and potential risk factors for scanxiety.

Abstract

The study of families and couples often requires developing an understanding of complex interrelationships among variables that change between people and across time and context. As a result, family researchers are increasingly turning to intensive longitudinal assessment approaches to study the dynamic processes inherent in this field. This chapter uses the term ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to describe general approach of intensively collecting data from people as they go about their lives, as it is most commonly used in the social and health sciences. It addresses topics related to why EMA can be useful, what research questions can be addressed using EMA, and how researchers can think about implementing EMA studies. The chapter discusses the topic of ecological momentary interventions and how this intervention approach might be used with couples and families. It finally describes EMA studies that draw broadly from family, child, and couples literatures to illustrate various points. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

CUIDA-TE is an APP that offers transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy focused on enhancing emotion regulation. As a novelty, it incorporates ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which can provide psychological support in real time, when suffering arises. The main goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CUIDA-TE to improve emotion regulation in healthcare workers, a population that has been particularly emotionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

In this three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) the study sample will be composed of a minimum of 174 healthcare workers. They will be randomly assigned to a 2-month EMI group (CUIDA-TE APP, n ≥ 58), a 2-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA) only group (MONITOR EMOCIONAL APP, n ≥ 58), or a wait-list control group (no daily monitoring nor intervention, n ≥ 58). CUIDA-TE will provide EMI if EMA reveals emotional problems, poor sleep quality/quantity, burnout, stress, or low perceived self-efficacy when regulating emotions. Depression will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include emotion regulation, quality of life, and resilience. Treatment acceptance and usability will also be measured. Primary and secondary outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements, and at the 3-month follow-up for all groups.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that evaluates the efficacy of an APP-based EMI to improve emotion regulation skills in healthcare workers. This type of intervention might ultimately help disseminate treatments and reach a larger number of individuals than traditional face-to-face individual therapies.

Introduction Interparental conflict exposure places adolescents at risk for problems with stress and anxiety; existing prevention/intervention strategies focus on reducing interparental conflict. Mindfulness-based programmes may be a promising treatment strategy for this population, but studies have not yet tested whether they are effective in this high-conflict context. In addition, evidence suggests that extensions to traditional treatments, such as delivering components in daily life that are tailored to moments of need, can increase treatment efficacy, particularly when combined with in-person treatments and particularly for adolescents. However, there are no such extensions to mindfulness interventions available. The Moving 2 Mindful study aims to (1) develop an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) supplement to Learning to BREATHE (L2B), an evidence-based mindfulness intervention for adolescents; (2) refine the EMI programme and determine the best delivery plan; (3) examine the feasibility and acceptability of L2B Plus (L2B plus the developed supplement) and (4) examine the potential for L2B Plus to reduce stress and anxiety for adolescents from high-conflict homes.

Methods and analysis The Moving 2 Mindful study proposes a mixed-methods approach to developing and refining a multimethod adaptive supplement to L2B. Feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness will be tested in a sample of 38 families, who will be randomly assigned to receive L2B Plus or an active health and wellness control condition and followed until 3 months postintervention. A range of psychosocial and physiological factors will be assessed at multiple time points. This study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (ID NCT03869749; pre-results).

Objective: AD caregivers can provide narrative about what issues need to be addressed in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to capture real-time and real-scenario needs in AD caregiving, and Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) as online e-learning to assist in areas of concerns.

Method: Twelve focus group discussions took place with AD caregivers for a total of 62 people interviewed. Once major themes in surveys and learning were identified by using discourse analysis, AD caregivers expressed the likelihood that these themes (where 0 meant “nil” and 1 meant “completely”) would address their focal needs in caregiving and topics in learning. Z scores for proportions and Cohen's d effect size were calculated for each item reporting the averaged scores.

Results: AD caregivers indicated that the major areas of concern that could benefit from an EMA/EMI online platform were: support (d=3.08), collaboration (d=1.85), medication review (d=1.21), dealing with grief and mourning, and time (d=0.97). Moreover, they identified personal resources available to provide help to colleagues: support (d=1.34), information (d=0.97), collaboration (d=2.06), hospital admission (d=3.08), and hospital discharge (d=5.50).

Negative life events (LEs) are associated with mental health problems in youth. However, little is known about underlying mechanisms. The aim of the study was to investigate whether exposure to LEs modifies stress sensitivity in youth’s daily life.

Methods

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) was used to assess stress sensitivity (i.e., association of momentary stress with (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences) in 99 adolescents and young adults (42 service users, 17 siblings, and 40 controls; Mage 15 years). Before EMA, exposure to LEs (e.g., intrusive threats, experience of loss, serious illness) was assessed.

Results

Lifetime as well as previous-year exposure to LEs modified stress sensitivity in service users: they experienced more intense negative affect and psychotic experiences in response to stress when high vs. low exposure levels were compared. In contrast, controls showed no differences in stress sensitivity by exposure levels. Looking at specific types of LEs, controls showed less intense negative affect in response to stress when high vs. low exposure levels to threatening events during the last year, but not lifetime exposure, were compared. In siblings, no evidence was found that LEs modified stress sensitivity.

Conclusion

Stress sensitivity may constitute a putative risk mechanism linking LEs and mental health in help-seeking youth, while unfavourable effects of LEs on stress sensitivity may attenuate over time or do not occur in controls and siblings. Targeting individuals’ sensitivity to stress in daily life using novel digital interventions may be a promising approach towards improving youth mental health.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-022-02276-0,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1KKLnd8LZTkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

•

A Alcohol use and intoxication were similar in event-contingent EMA and daily diaries.

•

Daily diaries had higher compliance than event-contingent EMA on drinking days.

•

Missing EMA associated with higher alcohol use and intoxication reported in daily diaries.

Abstract
Background

Daily diaries and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) are frequently used to assess event-level college student drinking. While both methods have advantages, they also raise questions about data validity, particularly in regard to alcohol’s impact on protocol compliance. The current study examined congruence in drinking behaviors reported via retrospective daily diaries and event-contingent drinking logs, protocol compliance with each method, and the extent to which alcohol consumption impacted compliance.

Methods

Participants were first-semester college women (n = 69) who reported 4+ drinks during an occasion at least once in the past month. Participants reported the number of drinks consumed and subjective intoxication using a 14-day EMA protocol. Event-contingent drinking logs (via self-initiated EMA) assessed behavior immediately after each drinking event; daily diaries assessed behaviors from the previous day. Pairwise correlations examined congruence between drinking logs and corresponding daily dairies; protocol compliance was examined through descriptive analysis of data missingness; and multilevel regression models assessed the associations between protocol compliance, alcohol consumption, and subjective intoxication.

Results

Drinking log and daily diary reports were highly correlated (r’s = 0.70 to 0.93). On drinking days, diary reports had higher protocol compliance (96.0%) compared to momentary drinking logs (41.4%). Drinking log missingness was associated with greater alcohol use and subjective intoxication reported in the corresponding daily diary (p’s < 0.05).

Background: mobile applications (apps) facilitate cancer pain ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and provide more reliable data than retrospective monitoring. The aims of this study are (a) to describe the status of persons with cancer pain when assessed ecologically, (b) to analyze the utility of clinical alarms integrated into the app, and (c) to test the feasibility of implementing an app for daily oncological pain monitoring. Methods: in this feasibility study, 21 patients (mean age = 56.95 years, SD = 10.53, 81.0% men) responded to an app-based evaluation of physical status (baseline and breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP)) and mental health variables (fatigue, mood, and coping) daily during 30 days. Results: cancer pain characterization with the app was similar to data from the literature using retrospective assessments in terms of BTcP duration and perceived medication effectiveness. However, BTcP was less frequent when evaluated ecologically. Pain, fatigue, and mood were comparable in the morning and evening. Passive coping strategies were the most employed daily. Clinical alarms appear to be useful to detect and address adverse events. App implementation was feasible and acceptable. Conclusion: apps reduce recall bias and facilitate a rapid response to adverse events in oncological care.

Wearable and mobile technology provides new opportunities to manage health conditions remotely and unobtrusively. For example, healthcare providers can repeatedly sample a person's condition to monitor progression of symptoms and intervene if necessary. There is usually a utility-tolerability trade-off between collecting information at sufficient frequencies and quantities to be useful, and over-burdening the user or the underlying technology, particularly when active input is required from the user. Selecting the next sampling time adaptively using previous responses, so that people are only sampled at high frequency when necessary, can help to manage this trade-off. We present a novel approach to adaptive sampling using clustered continuous-time hidden Markov models. The model predicts, at any given sampling time, the probability of moving to an `alert' state, and the next sample time is scheduled when this probability has exceeded a given threshold. The clusters, each representing a distinct sub-model, allow heterogeneity in states and state transitions. The work is illustrated using longitudinal mental-health symptom data in 49 people collected using ClinTouch, a mobile app designed to monitor people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Using these data, we show how the adaptive sampling scheme behaves under different model parameters and risk thresholds, and how the average sampling can be substantially reduced whilst maintaining a high sampling frequency during high-risk periods.",https://pure.manchester.ac.uk/ws/files/186027288/Hulme_IEEE_JBHI2020_Adaptive_Symptom_Monitoring_using_Hidden_Markov_Models._An_application_in_Ecological_Momentary_Assessment.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:jpemtN3OSZ4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",ieeexplore.ieee.org

Background: The recent introduction of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) smartphone-based strategies has allowed achieving some interesting data on the frequency of different awake bruxism (AB) behaviors reported by an individual in the natural environment. Objective: The present paper aims to review the literature on the reported frequency of AB based on data gathered via smartphone EMA technology. Methods: On September 2022, a systematic search in the Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases was performed to identify all peer-reviewed English-language studies assessing awake bruxism behaviors using a smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessment. The selected articles were assessed independently by two authors according to a structured reading of the articles’ format (PICO). Results: A literature search, for which the search terms “Awake Bruxism” and “Ecological Momentary Assessment” were used, identified 15 articles. Of them, eight fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results of seven studies using the same smartphone-based app reported a frequency of AB behaviors in the range between 28.3 and 40% over one week, while another investigation adopted a different smartphone-based EMA approach via WhatsApp using a web-based survey program and reported an AB frequency of 58.6%. Most included studies were based on convenience samples with limited age range, highlighting the need for more studies on other population samples.

The usage of mobile applications in healthcare is gaining popularity in recent years. The ubiquity of a sophisticated mobile appliance that is applicable to sample ecological patient data in real life by acquiring both mental state and environmental data has enabled new possibilities for researchers and healthcare providers. Collecting data using the mentioned approach is often called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and is characterized by an unidirectional data flow towards the platform provider. A more challenging approach, in turn, is called Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI). The latter requires a bidirectional data flow in order to enable the possibility of sending feedback to the patients and controlling their experiences through interventions. Although both approaches are established parts of IT-supported treatments in the field of psychology and psychotherapy until now, the so-called intersession process has not been technically supported appropriately yet. Therefore, the Intersession-Online platform was developed in order to (a) assess intersession processes systematically, (b) monitor a patient, and (c) intervene by suppressing negative thoughts concerning the therapy. In this paper, the technical requirements, architecture, and features of the mobile application of the Intersession-Online platform are presented. In this context, the development of a patient data sampling mechanism, which consists of a sophisticated, inter-questionnaire dependent sampling schedule and synchronization strategy is particularly illustrated and discussed. Altogether, the technical challenges will show that a mobile application supporting intersession processes in psychotherapy is an endeavor which requires many considerations. However, on the other, such a mobile application may be the basis for new technical as well as psychological insights.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705092031718X/pdf?md5=082bb165452e970c9d44d5ab4a60d5d3&pid=1-s2.0-S187705092031718X-main.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:ZeTwYogdR5cJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors.


Objective:
This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information.


Methods:
A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges.


Results:
Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03).


Conclusions:
Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

Background:
People with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses often lack access to evidence-based interventions, particularly interventions that target meaningful recovery outcomes such as social functioning and quality of life. Mobile technologies, including smartphone apps, have the potential to provide scalable support that places elements of evidence-based interventions at the palm of patients’ hands.


Objective:
We aim to develop a smartphone app—called Motivation and Skills Support—to provide targeted social goal support (eg, making new friends and improving existing relationships) for people with schizophrenia enrolled in a stand-alone open trial.


Methods:
In this paper, we presented preliminary outcomes of 31 participants who used the Motivation and Skills Support app for 8 weeks, including social functioning pre- to postintervention, and momentary reports of treatment targets (eg, social motivation and appraisals) during the intervention.


Results:
The findings suggest that the intervention improved self-reported social functioning from baseline to treatment termination, particularly in female participants. Gains were not maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, increased social functioning was predicted by momentary reports of social appraisals, including perceived social competence and the extent to which social interactions were worth the effort.


Conclusions:
The implications of these findings and future directions for addressing social functioning in schizophrenia using mobile technology have been discussed.

ABSTRACT

This study investigated the efficacy of using ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/EMI) to target body checking behaviors. Body checking has been shown to increase body dissatisfaction and play a role in eating disorders, but few treatments specifically targeting body checking have been empirically evaluated. Forty-four female undergraduates who reported engaging in frequent body checking behaviors participated in a five-day study wherein they were assessed five times a day via smart phone. On the final two days of the study, intervention messages were sent containing cognitive-behavioral strategies for decreasing body checking. Body checking behaviors increased within each day, but decreased across the five day intervention period. Pretest to posttest analyses found healthy improvements in a number of body image related constructs. These results highlight that 1) body checking appears to increase throughout the day, and 2) targeting body checking behaviors through brief EMA/EMI may be a useful clinical tool.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of different coping styles on situational coping in everyday life situations and gender differences. An ecological momentary assessment study with the mobile health app TrackYourStress was conducted with 113 participants. The coping styles Positive Thinking, Active Stress Coping, Social Support, Support in Faith, and Alcohol and Cigarette Consumption of the Stress and Coping Inventory were measured at baseline. Situational coping was assessed by the question “How well can you cope with your momentary stress level” over 4 weeks. Multilevel models were conducted to test the effects of the coping styles on situational coping. Additionally, gender differences were evaluated. Positive Thinking (p = 0.03) and Active Stress Coping (p = 0.04) had significant positive impacts on situational coping in the total sample. For women, Social Support had a significant positive effect on situational coping (p = 0.046). For men, Active Stress Coping had a significant positive effect on situational coping (p = 0.001). Women had higher scores on the SCI scale Social Support than men (p = 0.007). These results suggest that different coping styles could be more effective in daily life for women than for men.

Use of the paretic arm and hand is a key indicator of recovery and reintegration after stroke. A sound methodology is essential to comprehensively identify the possible factors impacting daily arm/hand use behavior. We combined ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a prompt methodology capturing real-time psycho-contextual factors, with accelerometry to investigate arm/hand behavior in the natural environment. Our aims were to determine (1) feasibility and (2) measurement validity of the combined methodology. We monitored 30 right-dominant, mild-moderately motor impaired chronic stroke survivors over 5 days (6 EMA prompts/day with accelerometers on each wrist). We observed high adherence for accelerometer wearing time (80.3%), EMA prompt response (84.6%), and generally positive user feedback upon exit interview. The customized prompt schedule and the self-triggered prompt option may have improved adherence. There was no evidence of EMA response bias nor immediate measurement reactivity. An unexpected small but significant increase in paretic arm/hand use was observed over days (12–14 min), which may be the accumulated effect of prompting that provided a reminder to choose the paretic limb. Further research that uses this combined methodology is needed to develop targeted interventions that effectively change behavior and enable reintegration post-stroke.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/6/1328,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:9jyEQ_zKygcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.mdpi.com

Introduction Suicide is one of the leading public health issues worldwide. Mobile health can help us to combat suicide through monitoring and treatment. The SmartCrisis V.2.0 randomised clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Intervention to prevent suicidal thoughts and behaviour.

Methods and analysis The SmartCrisis V.2.0 study is a randomised clinical trial with two parallel groups, conducted among patients with a history of suicidal behaviour treated at five sites in France and Spain. The intervention group will be monitored using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and will receive an Ecological Momentary Intervention called ‘SmartSafe’ in addition to their treatment as usual (TAU). TAU will consist of mental health follow-up of the patient (scheduled appointments with a psychiatrist) in an outpatient Suicide Prevention programme, with predetermined clinical appointments according to the Brief Intervention Contact recommendations (1, 2, 4, 7 and 11 weeks and 4, 6, 9 and 12 months). The control group would receive TAU and be monitored using EMA.

Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Fundación Jiménez Díaz. It is expected that, in the near future, our mobile health intervention and monitoring system can be implemented in routine clinical practice. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and psychiatric congresses. Reference number EC005-21_FJD.

Introduction

Chronic cancer-related fatigue (CCRF) is a complex multidimensional problem warranting person-centered care. Providing patients and therapists personalized feedback based on network analysis applied to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data could facilitate case conceptualization in psycho-oncological care. The aim was to explore patients' and therapists' experiences of using an EMA app and personalized feedback based on network theory to aid case conceptualization in psycho-oncological care.

Methods

A n = 5 proof-of-concept study was implemented in routine psycho-oncological care. We purposively selected adult cancer patients suffering from severe CCRF who were on the waitlist for psycho-oncological care. During a 3-week period participants filled out the EMA app Energy InSight (fatigue, mood, activity, responding, and context) five times a day. Participants received a descriptive and network feedback report, which they reflected upon during the first therapy sessions. Thematic analysis was used to analyze user experiences.

Results

Patients experienced that filling out the Energy InSight app, as well as receiving descriptive and network-based personalized feedback provided them with insight into their CCRF. Although therapists experienced the discussion of network feedback as challenging, it facilitated the case conceptualization.

Discussion

Using EMA during waitlist for psychological care seemed feasible. Patients experienced beneficial effects from filling out the EMA app and talking over the personalized feedback reports, which in turn aided case conceptualization and personalized care. Based on this evaluation, an improved version of the Energy InSight app and a therapist training for providing network feedback is developed for implementation in psycho-oncological care.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782922000756,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:LbYB5FiwAnAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract

Background: Digital interventions offer new avenues for low-threshold prevention
and treatment in youth. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) represent a
powerful approach that allows for adaptive, real-time, and real-world delivery
of intervention components in daily life by real-time processing of multimodal
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data. Compassion-focused interventions
(CFIs) may be particularly amenable to translation into an EMI to strengthen
emotional resilience and modifying putative risk mechanisms, including stress
sensitivity, in daily lives of young help-seeking individuals.

Objective: We aimed to investigate feasibility, safety, and initial therapeutic
effects of a novel, accessible, transdiagnostic, ecological momentary, compassion-
focused intervention for improving emotional resilience to stress (‘EMIcompass’).
Methods: In an uncontrolled pilot study, help-seeking youth with psychotic,
depressive, and/or anxiety symptoms were offered the EMIcompass intervention
in addition to treatment as usual. EMIcompass consisted of three sessions with
a trained psychologist (i.e., training session of CFI exercises, follow-up ‘booster’
session, and review session) and a 3-week EMI (i.e., consisting of enhancing,
consolidating, and EMA-informed interactive tasks) administered through a
mobile health (mHealth) app.

Results: In total, ten individuals (Mean age=20.3 years, range 14-25 years) were
included in the study. Most participants were satisfied (80%) and reported low
burden of app usage. No adverse events were observed. In around 1/3 of all EMAs,
individuals scored high on stress, negative affect, or threat anticipation during the
intervention period, resulting in real-time delivery of CFI intervention components
in addition to weekly enhancing and daily consolidating tasks. Although findings
should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size, reduced stress
sensitivity, momentary negative affect, and psychotic experiences as well as
increased positive affect were found at post-intervention and 4-week follow-up.
Further, reductions in psychotic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were found
(r=0.30-0.65).

Promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health in young people is a major global priority. Building emotional competence skills via a mobile app may be an effective, scalable and acceptable way to do this. A particular risk factor for anxiety and depression is elevated worry and rumination (repetitive negative thinking, RNT). An app designed to reduce RNT may prevent future incidence of depression and anxiety.

Method/design

The Emotional Competence for Well-Being in Young Adults study developed an emotional competence app to be tested via randomised controlled trials in a longitudinal prospective cohort. This off-shoot study adapts the app to focus on targeting RNT (worry, rumination), known risk factors for poor mental health. In this study, 16–24 year olds in the UK, who report elevated worry and rumination on standardised questionnaires are randomised to (i) receive the RNT-targeting app immediately for 6 weeks (ii) a waiting list control who receive the app after 6 weeks. In total, the study will aim to recruit 204 participants, with no current diagnosis of major depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis, across the UK. Assessments take place at baseline (pre-randomisation), 6 and 12 weeks post-randomisation. Primary endpoint and outcome for the study is level of rumination assessed on the Rumination Response Styles Questionnaire at 6 weeks. Worry, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and well-being are secondary outcomes. Compliance, adverse events and potentially mediating variables will be carefully monitored.

Discussion

This trial aims to better understand the benefits of tackling RNT via an mobile phone app intervention in young people. This prevention mechanism trial will establish whether targeting worry and rumination directly via an app provides a feasible approach to prevent depression and anxiety, with scope to become a widescale public health strategy for preventing poor mental health and promoting well-being in young people.

Abstract

Objective: People with serious mental illnesses (SMIs) are at high risk for suicidal ideation and behavior, and yet few suicide prevention interventions have been customized for this group. We describe the outcomes of a pilot trial of Mobile SafeTy And Recovery Therapy (mSTART), a four-session suicide-focused cognitive behavioral intervention for SMI, designed for the transition from acute to outpatient care and augmented with ecological momentary intervention to reinforce intervention content. Methods: The primary objective of this pilot trial was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of START. Seventy-eight people with SMI and elevated suicidal ideation were randomized to either: (a) mSTART or (b) START alone (i.e., without mobile augmentation). Participants were evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks (end of in-person sessions), 12 weeks (end of mobile intervention), and 24 weeks. The primary outcome of the study was change in suicidal ideation severity. Secondary outcomes included psychiatric symptoms, coping self-efficacy, and hopelessness. Results: A total of 27% of randomized persons were lost to follow-up after baseline, and engagement with mobile augmentation was variable. There was clinically significant improvement (d = 0.86) in suicidal ideation severity scores sustained over 24 weeks, with similar effects seen for secondary outcomes. Preliminary comparison indicated a medium effect size (d = 0.48) advantage at 24 weeks of mobile augmentation in suicidal ideation severity scores. Treatment credibility and satisfaction scores were high. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: START, regardless of mobile augmentation, was associated with sustained improvement in suicidal ideation severity and secondary outcomes in people with SMI at-risk for suicide in this pilot trial.

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) incorporate technology to administer interventions and are widely and effectively applied for heterogeneous psychological problems.

Contrary to expectations, the EMA condition did not show different outcomes from the EMI condition. Higher engagement in the mindfulness activities was related to higher levels of positive affect, and participants who reported being more aware of emotions (i.e., thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) due to the messages reported lower emotion dysregulation. More emotional awareness due to the mindfulness messages was related to greater usage of messages and a higher likelihood of recommending skills to a friend, and those reporting increased usage of mindfulness messages were more likely to recommend mindfulness skills to a friend.

Background:
Young people are a target population for mental health–related early intervention and prevention. Although evidence for early intervention is promising, availability of and access to youth mental health services remain limited. Therefore, the development of an evidence-based hybrid intervention is urgently needed.


Objective:
This study aimed to present a manual for a hybrid intervention, combining an ecological momentary intervention and face-to-face sessions aimed for enhancing resilience in help-seeking young people based on compassion-focused interventions, and explore whether participants’ baseline characteristics are associated with putative mechanisms and outcomes of the EMIcompass intervention. Specifically, we aimed to explore initial signals as to whether participants’ sociodemographic, clinical, and functional characteristics at baseline are associated with putative mechanisms (ie, change in self-compassion, change in emotion regulation, working alliance, training frequency); and whether participants’ sociodemographic, clinical, and functional characteristics, self-compassion, and emotion regulation at baseline are associated with clinical outcomes (ie, psychological distress and general psychopathology at postintervention and 4-week follow-ups) in the experimental condition and obtain first parameter estimates.


Methods:
We recruited young people aged 14 to 25 years, with psychological distress, Clinical High At-Risk Mental State, or first episodes of severe mental disorder for an exploratory randomized controlled trial with assessments at baseline and postintervention and 4-week follow-ups. A structured manual was developed and optimized based on a pilot study’s manual, a scoping review of existing literature and manuals, exchange with experts, the team’s clinical experience of working with compassion-focused interventions, and the principles of ecological momentary interventions. This analysis focuses on the experimental condition receiving the EMIcompass intervention.


Results:
A total of 46 young individuals were randomized to the experimental condition. There was evidence for initial signals of effects of age (B=0.11, 95% CI 0.00-0.22), general psychopathology (B=0.08, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.16), and clinical stage (B=1.50, 95% CI 0.06-2.93) on change in momentary self-compassion and change in emotion regulation from baseline to postintervention assessments. There was no evidence for associations of other baseline characteristics (eg, gender, minority status, and level of functioning) and putative mechanisms (eg, overall self-compassion, working alliance, and training frequency). In addition, except for an initial signal for an association of momentary self-compassion at baseline and psychological distress (B=−2.83, 95% CI −5.66 to 0.00), we found no evidence that baseline characteristics related to clinical outcomes.


Conclusions:
The findings indicated the reach of participants by the intervention largely independent of sociodemographic, clinical, and functional baseline characteristics. The findings need to be confirmed in a definitive trial.

Background: Despite the growing potential of mobile-based technologies, innovative interventions targeting the reduction of acute stress in daily life remain under-researched. Music listening is an easy-to-administer activity that is associated with lower levels of biological and self-reported stress. However, the application of music as an intervention in moments of acute stress in daily life remains to be examined. We developed a just-in-time intervention delivering music in moments of stressful experiences in daily life and tested its feasibility using a mixed methods approach.

Methods: In this uncontrolled pilot study, the ecological momentary music intervention (EMMI) was tested by 10 chronically stressed women aged 23.5 ± 3.3 years. Over 18 consecutive days, whenever participants reported stressful experiences, they were encouraged to listen to a self-compiled playlist. Subjective stress levels and saliva samples were assessed at three time points per stress report (T0, upon reporting a stressful situation; T1, directly after music listening/15 min after T0 in case of no music listening; T2, 15 min after T1). We analyzed app-based log data, in-the-moment responses, questionnaire data, and semi-structured interview data.

Results: On average, participants’ compliance with the study protocol lay at 70%. Overall, 65 stressful experiences were reported, 51 of which were followed by music listening, for an average duration of 12:53 min. Complete data (i.e., self-reports and saliva samples at all three time points) were provided for 46 stressful experiences. Participants reported immediate relaxation and distraction through music listening. The interviews revealed that the intervention was easy to use and that music listening in moments of perceived stress was viewed as a new and pleasant activity. Several aspects of the protocol (e.g., number of items and prompts) were identified, which should be improved in future studies.

Conclusion: Since repeated stressful experiences in daily life can pose a threat to physical and mental integrity, interventions that are easily applicable and deliver support when needed most are necessary. Following minor adaptations, the EMMI can be considered as a feasible approach to target psychobiological stress responses in daily life, which is worthy of investigation in future larger-scale trials.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.927705/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:EK37ul8_hpcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

Background:
Prevention of binge eating through just-in-time mobile interventions requires the prediction of respective high-risk times, for example, through preceding affective states or associated contexts. However, these factors and states are highly idiographic; thus, prediction models based on averages across individuals often fail.


Objective:
We developed an idiographic, within-individual binge-eating prediction approach based on ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data.


Methods:
We first derived a novel EMA-item set that covers a broad set of potential idiographic binge-eating antecedents from literature and an eating disorder focus group (n=11). The final EMA-item set (6 prompts per day for 14 days) was assessed in female patients with bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder. We used a correlation-based machine learning approach (Best Items Scale that is Cross-validated, Unit-weighted, Informative, and Transparent) to select parsimonious, idiographic item subsets and predict binge-eating occurrence from EMA data (32 items assessing antecedent contextual and affective states and 12 time-derived predictors).


Results:
On average 67.3 (SD 13.4; range 43-84) EMA observations were analyzed within participants (n=13). The derived item subsets predicted binge-eating episodes with high accuracy on average (mean area under the curve 0.80, SD 0.15; mean 95% CI 0.63-0.95; mean specificity 0.87, SD 0.08; mean sensitivity 0.79, SD 0.19; mean maximum reliability of rD 0.40, SD 0.13; and mean rCV 0.13, SD 0.31). Across patients, highly heterogeneous predictor sets of varying sizes (mean 7.31, SD 1.49; range 5-9 predictors) were chosen for the respective best prediction models.


Conclusions:
Predicting binge-eating episodes from psychological and contextual states seems feasible and accurate, but the predictor sets are highly idiographic. This has practical implications for mobile health and just-in-time adaptive interventions. Furthermore, current theories around binge eating need to account for this high between-person variability and broaden the scope of potential antecedent factors. Ultimately, a radical shift from purely nomothetic models to idiographic prediction models and theories is required.

Abstract

Objective: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) via mobile devices offers a promising approach for collecting real-time data from psychiatric patients, potentially as an augment to traditional measurement-based care strategies. This study examined whether EMA had added value in collecting clinically important data from recently hospitalized adults with psychosis, relative to traditional assessments. Method: In a sample of 24 adults with psychosis, EMA data regarding psychotic symptoms, affect, alcohol and drug use, functioning, quality of life, and social support were collected starting immediately posthospital discharge and extending for up to one month during their transition to outpatient care. EMA data were compared with traditional retrospective assessments of the same constructs, administered at a 1-month follow-up assessment. Results: Data from EMA and traditional retrospective assessments were correlated with each other in most cases. However, in some cases, participants were more likely to report drug use, medication nonadherence, and psychotic symptoms via EMA compared with traditional retrospective assessments. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Results suggest that the additional information obtained via frequent in-the-moment self-reports collected using smartphones can provide an expanded picture of individuals’ symptomatic and functional experiences. Thus, monitoring patients’ progress posthospitalization could be improved through the use of EMA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Background:
Alcohol use among university students is common, and those who drink often choose to drink heavily (ie, 4 or more drinks per session for women or 5 or more for men). Web-based interventions (WBIs), in which students complete assessments and receive personalized feedback about their alcohol use, and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile devices as a method of delivering intervention information, are 2 methods that have had some success in reducing alcohol use among university students.


Objective:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a combined WBI and EMI intervention to reduce alcohol use among university students.


Methods:
The study is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized into either a WBI+EMI condition, a WBI-only condition, or an assessment-only control. Our sample will consist of first-year university students, recruited through 5 residential colleges at the University of Otago, New Zealand. All participants will complete an online survey at baseline (ie, before Orientation Week); those in the WBI-only and WBI+EMI conditions will immediately receive personalized feedback (ie, the WBI), whereas participants in the assessment-only condition will receive no feedback. In addition, participants randomized into the WBI+EMI, but not those in the WBI-only or assessment-only groups, will receive 8 Orientation Week (2 per day on nights with large social events) and 6 academic year EMIs (delivered fortnightly). Participants in all conditions will complete brief surveys at the end of the first and second semester and report their weekend alcohol use fortnightly throughout each semester via ecological momentary assessments.


Results:
The primary hypothesis is that participants in the WBI+EMI group will consume significantly fewer drinks during weekends in their first semester at university compared with WBI-only and assessment-only groups. Secondary hypotheses are that, when compared with the WBI-only and assessment-only groups, the WBI+EMI group will report consuming fewer drinks during Orientation Week, report experiencing fewer negative alcohol-related consequences after first semester, and report lower Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption scores following their first semester.


Conclusions:
This study adds to a growing body of work investigating the utility of WBIs and EMIs in curbing alcohol consumption. In addition, the study will help to inform policy approaches aimed at curbing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm in university students.

ABSTRACT

Rates of Veteran suicide continue to be unacceptably high. Suicidal ideation and behavior are contextually and situationally based, limiting the ability of traditional prevention and assessment strategies to prevent acute crises. The Mobile Application for the Prevention of Suicide (MAPS) is a novel, smartphone-based intervention strategy that utilizes ecological momentary assessment to identify suicide risk in the moment and delivers treatment strategies in real-time. The app is personalized to each patient, utilizes empirically intervention strategies, and is delivered adjunctively to Veterans Affairs (VA) treatment as usual. This article outlines the MAPS intervention and presents results of an open trial to assess its feasibility and acceptability. Eight Veterans were recruited from aVeterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) psychiatric inpatient unit following hospitalization for either a suicide ideation or attempt. Veterans received MAPS for 2 weeks post-hospitalization. Veterans reported high levels of satisfaction with MAPS and all opted to extend their use of MAPS beyond the 2-week trial period. MAPS may be a useful adjunctive to treatment as usual for high-risk Veterans by allowing patients and their providers to better track suicide risk and deploy intervention strategies when risk is detected.

Abstract

Background

Bruxism is a masticatory muscle activity occurring during sleep or wakefulness, involving grinding and clenching of teeth and/or jaw bracing. As yet, the aetiology, epidemiology and consequences of awake bruxism (AB) are largely unknown.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to AB behaviours using a novel bruxism screener (BruxScreen) questionnaire part and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA; BruxApp©) on AB behaviours, and to investigate AB's prevalence among masticatory muscle myalgia patients and non-patients.

Methods

Altogether, 115 participants (masticatory myalgia patients referred to a specialist clinic (n = 67) and non-patients (n = 46)) filled in a bruxism screener questionnaire to report bruxism behaviours and jaw symptoms. A selection of both groups did a week-long EMA (patients n = 12, non-patients n = 11) to report AB behaviours. The chi-squared test was used to determine group differences in categorical variables. A logistic regression model was fitted to study the probability of AB.

Results

According to BruxScreen, bruxism behaviours and jaw symptoms were more frequent in patients than in non-patients (p < .001). Based on EMA, 14.6% of the behaviour in patients was tooth clenching; for non-patients, this was 0.5% (p < .000). Relaxed muscles were reported by patients and non-patients at 20.6% and 56.4%, respectively (p < .021). Logistic regression, adjusted by age and sex, revealed that patients reported AB 5 times more often than non-patients (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.1–11.2).

Conclusion

Awake bruxism behaviours are significantly more frequent in masticatory muscle myalgia patients than non-patients and associate with frequent bruxism-related symptoms. Self-reported teeth clenching seems to be the most significant sign of AB behaviour.

Abstract

The number of college students who need mental health treatment outpaces the resources available to counseling centers to provide these needed services, presenting a need for low-cost, scalable interventions for college populations. We conducted a pilot implementation-effectiveness trial of a scalable treatment package that consisted of a single (telehealth) workshop plus a companion app that provided ecological momentary intervention. Participants (n = 177) received a workshop provided by counseling center staff and trainees. We were interested in (1) engagement with the app, (2) acceptability of the treatment package, and (3) initial effectiveness of the treatment package. Regarding engagement with the app, we found that participants preferred two reminder prompts per day and identified two key breakpoints when engagement declined significantly: at day 15, when just over half of the sample practiced a skill on the app at least once during the day and at day 41, when just over one third of people practiced a skill on the app each day. Regarding acceptability of the treatment package, students generally reported positive attitudes about the single-session workshop and app, but also noted that the content and assessments in the app needed to be more dynamic to improve how engaging it is. Regarding effectiveness, we found that about 75% of the sample experienced a significant reduction in negative affect from pre- to post-ecological momentary intervention. Moreover, there were significant pre- to post-study decreases in experiential avoidance and symptoms of anxiety and depression and increases in self-efficacy for managing negative emotions. The results of this study are promising in terms of providing initial support for this novel treatment package and provide useful information for researchers planning to develop and test similar interventions.",https://psyarxiv.com/y8sj7/download?format=pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:YJ7o3rsEBZgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
Health professionals initiating mobile health (mHealth) interventions may choose to adapt apps designed for other activities (eg, peer-to-peer communication) or to employ purpose-built apps specialized in the required intervention, or to exploit apps based on methods such as the experience sampling method (ESM). An alternative approach for professionals would be to create their own apps. While ESM-based methods offer important guidance, current systems do not expose their design at a level that promotes replicating, specializing, or extending their contributions. Thus, a twofold solution is required: a method that directs specialists in planning intervention programs themselves, and a model that guides specialists in adopting existing solutions and advises software developers on building new ones.


Objective:
The main objectives of this study are to design the Experience Sampling and Programmed Intervention Method (ESPIM), formulated toward supporting specialists in deploying mHealth interventions, and the ESPIM model, which guides health specialists in adopting existing solutions and advises software developers on how to build new ones. Another goal is to conceive and implement a software platform allowing specialists to be users who actually plan, create, and deploy interventions (ESPIM system).


Methods:
We conducted the design and evaluation of the ESPIM method and model alongside a software system comprising integrated web and mobile apps. A participatory design approach with stakeholders included early software prototype, predesign interviews with 12 health specialists, iterative design sustained by the software as an instance of the method’s conceptual model, support to 8 real case studies, and postdesign interviews.


Results:
The ESPIM comprises (1) a list of requirements for mHealth experience sampling and intervention-based methods and systems, (2) a 4-dimension planning framework, (3) a 7-step-based process, and (4) an ontology-based conceptual model. The ESPIM system encompasses web and mobile apps. Eight long-term case studies, involving professionals in psychology, gerontology, computer science, speech therapy, and occupational therapy, show that the method allowed specialists to be actual users who plan, create, and deploy interventions via the associated system. Specialists’ target users were parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, older persons, graduate and undergraduate students, children (age 8-12), and caregivers of older persons. The specialists reported being able to create and conduct their own studies without modifying their original design. A qualitative evaluation of the ontology-based conceptual model showed its compliance to the functional requirements elicited.


Conclusions:
The ESPIM method succeeds in supporting specialists in planning, authoring, and deploying mobile-based intervention programs when employed via a software system designed and implemented according to its conceptual model. The ESPIM ontology–based conceptual model exposes the design of systems involving active or passive sampling interventions. Such exposure supports the evaluation, implementation, adaptation, or extension of new or existing systems.

We used data from a longitudinal study where 131 participants (Mean age 22.9 years, SD = 3.0) responded to μEMA surveys on a smartwatch for at least six months.

Background:
People with gambling problems frequently report repeated unsuccessful attempts to change their behavior. Although many behavior change techniques are available to individuals to reduce gambling harm, they can be challenging to implement or maintain. The provision of implementation support tailored for immediate, real-time, individualized circumstances may improve attempts at behavior change.


Objective:
We aimed to develop and evaluate a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for individuals who require support to adhere to their gambling limits. JITAI development is based on the principles of the Health Action Process Approach with delivery, in alignment with the principles of self-determination theory. The primary objective was to determine the effect of action- and coping planning compared with no intervention on the goal of subsequently adhering to gambling expenditure limits.


Methods:
Gambling Habit Hacker is delivered as a JITAI providing in-the-moment support for adhering to gambling expenditure limits (primary proximal outcome). Delivered via a smartphone app, this JITAI delivers tailored behavior change techniques related to goal setting, action planning, coping planning, and self-monitoring. The Gambling Habit Hacker app will be evaluated using a 28-day microrandomized trial. Up to 200 individuals seeking support for their own gambling from Australia and New Zealand will set a gambling expenditure limit (ie, goal). They will then be asked to complete 3 time-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) per day over a 28-day period. EMAs will assess real-time adherence to gambling limits, strength of intention to adhere to goals, goal self-efficacy, urge self-efficacy, and being in high-risk situations. On the basis of the responses to each EMA, participants will be randomized to the control (a set of 25 self-enactable strategies containing names only and no implementation information) or intervention (self-enactable strategy implementation information with facilitated action- and coping planning) conditions. This microrandomized trial will be supplemented with a 6-month within-group follow-up that explores the long-term impact of the app on gambling expenditure (primary distal outcome) and a range of secondary outcomes, as well as an evaluation of the acceptability of the JITAI via postintervention surveys, app use and engagement indices, and semistructured interviews. This trial has been approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2020-304).


Results:
The intervention has been subject to expert user testing, with high acceptability scores. The results will inform a more nuanced version of the Gambling Habit Hacker app for wider use.


Conclusions:
Gambling Habit Hacker is part of a suite of interventions for addictive behaviors that deliver implementation support grounded in lived experience. This study may inform the usefulness of delivering implementation intentions in real time and in real-world settings. It potentially offers people with gambling problems new support to set their gambling intentions and adhere to their limits.

Digital interventions targeting transdiagnostic mechanisms in daily life may be a promising translational strategy for prevention and early intervention of psychotic and other severe mental disorders. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and initial signals of efficacy of a transdiagnostic, compassion-focused, hybrid ecological momentary intervention for improving resilience (ie, EMIcompass) in youth with early mental health problems.

Study Design

In an exploratory, assessor-blind randomized controlled trial, youth aged 14–25 with current distress, broad at-risk mental state, or first episode of severe mental disorder were randomly allocated to experimental (EMIcompass+treatment as usual [TAU]) or control condition (TAU). Data on primary (stress reactivity) and secondary candidate mechanisms as well as candidate primary (psychological distress) and secondary outcomes were collected.

Study Results

Criteria for the feasibility of trial methodology and intervention delivery were met (n = 92 randomized participants). No serious adverse events were observed. Initial outcome signals were evident for reduced momentary stress reactivity (stress×time×condition, B = −0.10 95%CI −0.16–−0.03, d = −0.10), aberrant salience (condition, B = −0.38, 95%CI −0.57–−0.18, d = −0.56) as well as enhanced momentary resilience (condition, B = 0.55, 95%CI 0.18–0.92, d = 0.33) and quality of life (condition, B = 0.82, 95%CI 0.10–1.55, d = 0.60) across post-intervention and 4-week follow-up. No outcome signals were observed for self-reported psychological distress (condition, B = 0.57, 95%CI −1.59–2.72, d = 0.09), but there was suggestive evidence of reduced observer-rated symptoms at the 4-week follow-up (B = −1.41, 95%CI −2.85–0.02, d = −0.41).

Conclusions

Our findings provide evidence of feasibility and initial signals that EMIcompass may reduce stress reactivity and improve quality of life.

Mobile-based ecological momentary assessment (mEMA) offers a novel method for dietary assessment and may reduce recall bias and participant burden.

Abstract
Motivational deficits are an important predictor of functional outcomes in individuals with a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and mood spectrum disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a group version of “Switch,” an intervention that targets motivational deficits, enriched with an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) approach (i.e., prompts on the participants’ smartphone to encourage the use of trained strategies in their daily life). Eight participants with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or major depressive disorder entered the study. The intervention took place twice a week for 2 months. Assessment measures included traditional evaluations of motivational negative symptoms, apathy, quality of life and daily functioning, in addition to ambulatory assessment methods strategies, including the experience sampling method (ESM) to assess motivation and related processes, and actigraphy (daily step-count) to assess participants’ activity level. Four participants were considered as non-completers (followed less than 2/3 of the program) and four were considered as completers. Only completers presented a decrease in amotivation/apathy and an improvement in functional outcomes after the intervention and at follow-up. Furthermore, mixed-effects ESM models showed significant interaction effects on multiple processes related to motivation, indicating improvements only in completers: heightened motivation, increased engagement in meaningful and effortful activities, better mood, higher levels of confidence, increased frequency of projection into the future (pleasure anticipation), and of positive reminiscence. This preliminary investigation provides evidence that Switch may be an effective intervention, with specific effects on motivation and associated processes.

ABSTRACT

With the advancement of mobile technology, researchers are gaining immense interest in utilizing smartphones to deliver psychological interventions in people’s everyday lives to enhance health and well-being. In this paper, we aim to provide practical considerations and research practices for novice and experienced researchers who wish to conduct effective positive psychological research and interventions with these mobile-enabled ecological momentary interventions (mEMIs). Three characteristics and challenges of mEMIs (i.e., mobile, ecological, and momentary aspects) are described; and based on previous research and expertise, we present key considerations and recommended practices for each of these components that will help researchers towards successful design, implementation, and evaluation of mEMI research in positive psychology.

Abstract
Although ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides an opportunity for the examination of intervention mechanisms in real time, there are few validated tools to assess key treatment mechanisms in EMA studies. Our focus in this study is a potentially critical treatment mechanism, improvement in self-efficacy for managing negative emotions. We examined the psychometric properties of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) self-efficacy for managing negative emotions scale measured via EMA. Participants (n = 145 college students) in a clinical trial of Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills completed four daily EMAs for 6 weeks (13,153 total responses). Results indicated (a) excellent internal consistency and good factor structure, (b) sufficient variability at both the between- and the within-persons levels, and (c) strong construct and predictive validity. This study supports the validity of an EMA measure of self-efficacy for managing negative emotions that can be used in real time, both in intervention studies and in observational research.

Relapse prevention models suggest that positive outcome expectancies can constitute situational determinants of relapse episodes that interact with other factors to determine the likelihood of relapse. The primary aims were to examine reciprocal relationships between situational positive gambling outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour and moderators of these relationships. An online survey and a 28 day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) were administered to 109 past-month gamblers (84% with gambling problems). EMA measures included outcome expectancies (enjoyment/arousal, self-enhancement, money), self-efficacy, craving, negative emotional state, interpersonal conflict, social pressure, positive emotional state, financial pressures, and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure). Pre-EMA measures included problem gambling severity, motives, psychological distress, coping strategies, and outcome expectancies. No reciprocal relationships between EMA outcome expectancies and gambling behaviour (episodes, expenditure) were identified. Moderations predicting gambling episodes revealed: (1) cravings and problem gambling exacerbated effects of enjoyment/arousal expectancies; (2) positive emotional state and positive reframing coping exacerbated effects of self-enhancement expectancies; and (3) instrumental social support buffered effects of money expectancies. Positive outcome expectancies therefore constitute situational determinants of gambling behaviour, but only when they interact with other factors. All pre-EMA expectancies predicted problem gambling severity (OR = 1.61–3.25). Real-time interventions addressing gambling outcome expectancies tailored to vulnerable gamblers are required.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/10/8/1709,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:UKG8rTFYVcQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.mdpi.com

Abstract

Cigarette smoking remains the largest cause of preventable death in the United States and worldwide. In South Korea and other Asian countries, a large proportion of males smoke, increasing the need to examine cigarette smoking in these populations. Research suggests that the association between positive affect and negative affect, and between affect and craving, may differ across cultures, and that it is useful to examine these associations using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). South Korean smokers (N = 20, Mean Age = 21.15, 25% female) completed baseline questionnaires and downloaded an EMA app which prompted 4 random assessments (RAs) each day for 1-week. At each assessment, participants responded to items assessing momentary negative affect (NA) and positive affect (PA), craving, and number of cigarettes smoked since the previous EMA assessment. Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used to analyze EMA data (544 assessments), separating out between- and within- subject associations. There was a significant positive association between positive affect and negative affect at the between-subjects level. Both positive affect and negative affect were significantly positively associated with craving at between-subjects and within-subject levels. Craving was associated with subsequent smoking behavior at the within-subjects level. Overall, results suggest that associations between positive affect and negative affect may be different in South Korean smokers than in Western smokers, and that there are robust associations between both negative and positive affect and craving.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352853220301164,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:qZJu8PY4baEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
An extraordinary increase in mobile phone ownership has revolutionized the opportunities to use mobile health approaches in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMAI) uses mobile technology to gather data and deliver timely, personalized behavior change interventions in an individual’s natural setting. To our knowledge, there have been no previous trials of EMAI in sub-Saharan Africa.


Objective:
To advance the evidence base for mobile health (mHealth) interventions in LMICs, we conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility of EMAI and establish estimates of the potential effect of EMAI on a range of health-related behaviors in Rakai, Uganda.


Methods:
This prospective, parallel-group, randomized pilot trial compared health behaviors between adult participants submitting ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data and receiving behaviorally responsive interventional health messaging (EMAI) with those submitting EMA data alone. Using a fully automated mobile phone app, participants submitted daily reports on 5 different health behaviors (fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, and condomless sex with a non–long-term partner) during a 30-day period before randomization (P1). Participants were then block randomized to the control arm, continuing EMA reporting through exit, or the intervention arm, EMA reporting and behavioral health messaging receipt. Participants exited after 90 days of follow-up, divided into study periods 2 (P2: randomization + 29 days) and 3 (P3: 30 days postrandomization to exit). We used descriptive statistics to assess the feasibility of EMAI through the completeness of data and differences in reported behaviors between periods and study arms.


Results:
The study included 48 participants (24 per arm; 23/48, 48% women; median age 31 years). EMA data collection was feasible, with 85.5% (3777/4418) of the combined days reporting behavioral data. There was a decrease in the mean proportion of days when alcohol was consumed in both arms over time (control: P1, 9.6% of days to P2, 4.3% of days; intervention: P1, 7.2% of days to P3, 2.4% of days). Decreases in sex with a non–long-term partner without a condom were also reported in both arms (P1 to P3 control: 1.9% of days to 1% of days; intervention: 6.6% of days to 1.3% of days). An increase in vegetable consumption was found in the intervention (vegetable: 65.6% of days to 76.6% of days) but not in the control arm. Between arms, there was a significant difference in the change in reported vegetable consumption between P1 and P3 (control: 8% decrease in the mean proportion of days vegetables consumed; intervention: 11.1% increase; P=.01).


Conclusions:
Preliminary estimates suggest that EMAI may be a promising strategy for promoting behavior change across a range of behaviors. Larger trials examining the effectiveness of EMAI in LMICs are warranted.

Our approach focuses on user empowerment, engaging them into improving their own well-being. We provide a set of software tools which allow users to: (1) collect data from their daily lives, based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) techniques; (2) carry out interventions in their daily habits, with time/location aware notifications based on Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) techniques and (3) obtain insights –which help them in the task of defining those interventions¬ using visual analytics techniques. The contribution of this work is the EMA/EMI techniques being used by the user itself, opposed to conventional researcher-centered approaches.",https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.14-10-2015.2261615,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:bqbJZZlLdIIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",eudl.eu

Background:
Digital health technologies using mobile apps and wearable devices are a promising approach to the investigation of substance use in the real world and for the analysis of predictive factors or harms from substance use. Moreover, consecutive repeated data collection enables the development of predictive algorithms for substance use by machine learning methods.


Objective:
We developed a new self-monitoring mobile app to record daily substance use, triggers, and cravings. Additionally, a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit) was used to collect objective biological and behavioral data before, during, and after substance use. This study aims to describe a model using machine learning methods to determine substance use.


Methods:
This study is an ongoing observational study using a Fitbit and a self-monitoring app. Participants of this study were people with health risks due to alcohol or methamphetamine use. They were required to record their daily substance use and related factors on the self-monitoring app and to always wear a Fitbit for 8 weeks, which collected the following data: (1) heart rate per minute, (2) sleep duration per day, (3) sleep stages per day, (4) the number of steps per day, and (5) the amount of physical activity per day. Fitbit data will first be visualized for data analysis to confirm typical Fitbit data patterns for individual users. Next, machine learning and statistical analysis methods will be performed to create a detection model for substance use based on the combined Fitbit and self-monitoring data. The model will be tested based on 5-fold cross-validation, and further preprocessing and machine learning methods will be conducted based on the preliminary results. The usability and feasibility of this approach will also be evaluated.


Results:
Enrollment for the trial began in September 2020, and the data collection finished in April 2021. In total, 13 people with methamphetamine use disorder and 36 with alcohol problems participated in this study. The severity of methamphetamine or alcohol use disorder assessed by the Drug Abuse Screening Test-10 or the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-10 was moderate to severe. The anticipated results of this study include understanding the physiological and behavioral data before, during, and after alcohol or methamphetamine use and identifying individual patterns of behavior.


Conclusions:
Real-time data on daily life among people with substance use problems were collected in this study. This new approach to data collection might be helpful because of its high confidentiality and convenience. The findings of this study will provide data to support the development of interventions to reduce alcohol and methamphetamine use and associated negative consequences.

Abstract
College can be a stressful period of life, in which a history of interpersonal trauma is
associated with greater risk of distress. Specifically, students with a history of childhood
emotional abuse report more distress despite the lack of research on emotional abuse.
Thus, it is imperative to develop interventions to help reduce distress in this population.
One novel approach involves ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use
mobile phone platforms to deliver near-real-time psychosocial interventions in daily life
and can increase access to psychotherapeutic care. This study is the first randomized
controlled trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of an EMI for reducing
psychological distress among students with and without an emotional abuse history. For
14 days, participants (N = 382) were randomly assigned to receive: 1) the EMI that
teaches stress management skills or 2) an ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a
self-monitoring control condition with assessments only. Participants completed pretest,
posttest, and three-week follow-up measures. Linear mixed models indicated that there
were no significant condition-by-time interaction effects, suggesting that changes over
time occurred regardless of condition (EMI vs. EMA). There were different levels of
EMI efficacy depending on emotional abuse history, in that the EMI was generally more
effective for those with a history of emotional abuse and the EMA was more effective for
those without such a history. Overall, the EMI appeared feasible, acceptable, and usable,
although less effective than web-based versions. Because of this, college counseling
centers might rather streamline resources to further promote web-based interventions.
Future interventions could also target certain at-risk groups, based on their trauma history
or baseline levels of distress.

Abstract

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a useful tool to investigate antecedents and consequences of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), a robust predictor of Veteran suicide risk. Despite elucidating temporal changes among dynamic variables, EMA remains underutilized to study NSSI among veterans, perhaps due to concerns of safety and utility. The present study analyzed data collected from semi-structured interviews of veterans following a 28-day EMA study of NSSI, including benefits, challenges, and recommendations for improvement. Participants included 34 veterans endorsing NSSI history, most meeting criteria for NSSI Disorder. Qualitative analysis of de-identified transcripts used the rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique and thematic analysis. Findings revealed all veterans reported at least one emotional/social benefit to participation, including finding it therapeutic, gaining self-awareness/insight, and improved social functioning. Challenges and recommendations were primarily technology-related, including adjustment to device use. Many expressed interest in incorporation of clinical resources, use of personal devices/VA app, and ability to share responses with providers. Assessment frequency/content was never described as triggering suicidal/nonsuicidal urges and over half of participants noted urge/behavior reduction. Results support acceptability and safety of EMA for NSSI among veterans and potential clinical utility as a psychotherapy adjunct to promote self-awareness and NSSI reduction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9169428/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:w9uF0fRL9d8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract
Background

The transition from high school to university is associated with increased alcohol use and harm. Web-based interventions (WBIs) and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are two methods that have had some success in reducing alcohol use among university students and may be particularly effective if implemented during the transition to university. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effectiveness of a combined WBI and EMI to reduce alcohol use among incoming university students.

Methods

Incoming first-year students (n = 783, in 2018 and 2019) were randomized into either a WBI + EMI, WBI-only, or an assessment-only condition. All participants completed online questionnaires before university, after their first and second semester, and reported their alcohol use fortnightly throughout their first year. Those in the WBI + EMI and WBI conditions received online feedback about their drinking (i.e., the WBI) immediately following the pre-university survey. Those in the WBI + EMI were also sent eight EMI messages to their mobile phones during Orientation Week and six EMI messages across the academic year aimed at reducing alcohol harm.

Results

There were no significant differences between the conditions in Orientation Week drinking, academic year drinking (both “typical” semester or fortnightly drinking), or alcohol-related harms.

Conclusion

A WBI + EMI intervention aimed at the transition to university did not reduce university students’ alcohol use. The transition, however, continues to be a period of serious harm where students drink more than any other period.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1E3RLs0aGQgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
The presence of discrete but fluctuating precipitants, in combination with the dynamic nature of gambling episodes, calls for the development of tailored interventions delivered in real time, such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). JITAIs leverage mobile and wireless technologies to address dynamically changing individual needs by providing the type and amount of support required at the right time and only when needed. They have the added benefit of reaching underserved populations by providing accessible, convenient, and low-burden support. Despite these benefits, few JITAIs targeting gambling behavior are available.


Objective:
This study aims to redress this gap in service provision by developing and evaluating a theoretically informed and evidence-based JITAI for people who want to reduce their gambling. Delivered via a smartphone app, GamblingLess: In-The-Moment provides tailored cognitive-behavioral and third-wave interventions targeting cognitive processes explicated by the relapse prevention model (cravings, self-efficacy, and positive outcome expectancies). It aims to reduce gambling symptom severity (distal outcome) through short-term reductions in the likelihood of gambling episodes (primary proximal outcome) by improving craving intensity, self-efficacy, or expectancies (secondary proximal outcomes). The primary aim is to explore the degree to which the delivery of a tailored intervention at a time of cognitive vulnerability reduces the probability of a subsequent gambling episode.


Methods:
GamblingLess: In-The-Moment interventions are delivered to gamblers who are in a state of receptivity (available for treatment) and report a state of cognitive vulnerability via ecological momentary assessments 3 times a day. The JITAI will tailor the type, timing, and amount of support for individual needs. Using a microrandomized trial, a form of sequential factorial design, each eligible participant will be randomized to a tailored intervention condition or no intervention control condition at each ecological momentary assessment across a 28-day period. The microrandomized trial will be supplemented by a 6-month within-group follow-up evaluation to explore long-term effects on primary (gambling symptom severity) and secondary (gambling behavior, craving severity, self-efficacy, and expectancies) outcomes and an acceptability evaluation via postintervention surveys, app use and engagement indices, and semistructured interviews. In all, 200 participants will be recruited from Australia and New Zealand.


Results:
The project was funded in June 2019, with approval from the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2020-304). Stakeholder user testing revealed high acceptability scores. The trial began on March 29, 2022, and 84 participants have been recruited (as of June 24, 2022). Results are expected to be published mid-2024.


Conclusions:
GamblingLess: In-The-Moment forms part of a suite of theoretically informed and evidence-based web-based and mobile gambling interventions. This trial will provide important empirical data that can be used to facilitate the JITAI’s optimization to make it a more effective, efficient, and scalable tailored intervention.

Background: Smoking urges and negative affect play important roles in daily cigarette smoking and smoking lapse during a cessation attempt. Traditionally, laboratory research has considered negative affect as a potential cause of smoking urges. A deeper understanding of momentary associations between negative affect and smoking urges during a smoking cessation attempt can inform treatment development efforts. This study examined whether the within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges differed before and after a quit attempt, and by intervention type.

Methods: Data are from a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing 3 smoking cessation interventions. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a novel, smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention that tailored treatment content in real-time (Smart-T2; n = 24), (2) the National Cancer Institute QuitGuide app (n = 25), or (3) a clinic-based tobacco cessation program (TTRP; n = 23) that followed Clinical Practice Guidelines. All participants received up to 12 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy and completed up to 5 assessments per day (MPreQuit= 25.8 assessments, SD = 6.0; MPostQuit= 107.7 assessments, SD = 37.1) of their negative affect and smoking urges during the 7 days (M = 6.6 days, SD = 1.0) prior to their quit-date and the 29 days (M = 25.8 days, SD = 6.4) after their quit-date. Prior to analysis, repeated measures of smoking urges were decomposed into between-person and within-person components.

Results: After accounting for baseline nicotine dependence, Bayesian multilevel models indicated that the extent of within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges was stronger in the post-quit stage of the intervention than the pre-quit stage. Results also indicated that in the post-quit stage of the intervention, the within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges was weaker for those in the Smart-T2 and TTRP groups compared with those in the QuitGuide group. The extent of this within-person association did not differ between those in the Smart-T2 and TTRP groups.

Conclusions: These findings offer preliminary evidence that the momentary within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges increases following a quit attempt, and that the TTRP and Smart-T2 interventions may weaken this association. Research is needed to replicate and expand upon current findings in a fully powered randomized controlled trial.

Smartphones are part of individuals’ daily lifestyles, as are smartphone applications such as dating apps. Previous evidence suggests that high engagement in dating applications can be detrimental to some users’ wellbeing. However, much of the published research has relied on cross-sectional studies and self-report measures. Therefore, the present study aims to overcome the limitations of subjective measures in cross-sectional designs by investigating for the first time the relationship between dating app users’ wellbeing (self-esteem, craving and mood) and objective measures of their use during a one-week period. To do this, the present study employed a newly developed application, DiaryMood and utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA), as it measured subjects’ mood, self-esteem and craving three times per day and the time spent using the dating apps per day during one week. A convenience sample of 22 online dating app users participated in the present study. Findings from a three-level multilevel analysis indicated that increased time spent on dating apps predicted craving among dating app users and that notifications led to an improved mood and higher self-esteem. The results are discussed in relation to previous online dating studies. In sum, the present study sets a precedent for the use of EMA within the scope of online dating research, which may promote further studies adopting this methodology.",https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/9/5631,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:epBR0gHUc48J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.mdpi.com

In a sample of 90 adolescents (Mage = 14.7; 66% boys, 34% girls; 76.7% White, 13.3% Black or African American, 8.9% more than one race, 1.1% “other”) treated for ADHD by their pediatricians, this study examined: (1) whether self-rated ADHD symptoms decreased across 17 days of 4 times daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of symptoms and (2) whether completing versus missing an EMA survey was associated with lower self-rated ADHD symptoms in the subsequent hours.

Results

Multilevel regression analyses showed that, on average, adolescents’ perceived ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and total across domains) decreased across 17 days of EMA. Within person, symptoms were lower following completed versus missed EMA surveys. Significant moderating effects showed that the effect of completing the prior EMA survey weakened across the day and over the course of the 17 days.

Conclusions

This study is the first to document acute improvements in self-rated ADHD symptoms using EMA in adolescents’ naturalistic environments. Symptom monitoring throughout the day may help adolescents improve their day-to-day ADHD, at least acutely, and holds promise as one component of mobile-health ADHD interventions.

An Introduction to Smartphone Possibilities

Among other things, human change depends on self-awareness and self-reflection. But the pace and distractions of modern life often crowd out self-reflection. Technology--especially mobile technology--has made it easy to fill our downtime with various distractions, limiting our capacity for awareness and even empathy (Konrath, O'Brien & Hsing, 2011). Remarkable tools for modern life, smartphones seem to be adding to the noise and frenetic pace of our lives. But can smartphones also be part of the solution to the challenges of modern life? Can the smartphone contribute to human flourishing and the common good? Can the smartphone be redeemed? These are important questions because smartphones seem here to stay.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans now own smartphones and 90% of the time their devices are in the same room with them (Dey et al., 2011). Smartphones are increasingly being viewed as an extension of the self. It's no wonder that our students, like many of us, feel uneasy when separated from their phones. MIT professor Sherry Turkle (2015) recently noted, ""Our phones are not accessories, but psychologically potent devices that change not just what we do but who we are."" Social scientists and technologists alike have suggested that smartphones will continue to expand our senses and capacities in an integrated, social and self-evolving manner. In one sense, smartphones are making superheroes of us all. We can simultaneously take a walk in the park, track our steps, connect with our spouse across town and business associates across the world--a feat that would have seemed superhuman less than 25 years ago. This idea of being mobile and in multiple places, at the same time, was reserved for Superman less than 25 years ago. On the other hand, as noted above, there are valid concerns about the way smartphones may be shaping us. Given the role technology and smartphones play and will play in shaping us and our interactions, how might smartphones be used well? What are the implications for understanding and caring for our students, clients and underserved community members?

Abstract
Introduction

Emotional disorders are the most frequent mental health problems globally. To ensure the dissemination of psychological treatments for these conditions, novel forms of delivery (e.g., Internet or mobile apps) and more scalable forms of psychotherapy (e.g., transdiagnostic interventions) have become increasingly popular. Research, however, shows that a significant number of patients, around 40 % according to some studies, do not respond to the interventions as expected (i.e., not-on-track patients). Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) could simplify tailoring treatments to the patients' progress and rapidly respond to undesired outcomes during psychotherapy. Therefore, these would facilitate measurement-based care with little therapist involvement. This study aims to explore the feasibility of an app-based system called My EMI, Emotional Well-being for people with emotional disorders. According to daily EMAs, the app will provide personalized EMIs while participants receive a self-applied online transdiagnostic treatment. The app will be used as an add-tool to the online intervention to address emotion dysregulation, foster adherence, and reinforce contents. The current study describes the study protocol for this trial.

Method and analysis

A single-group, open trial design will be used. Participants will be 30 adults suffering from emotional disorders. Primary outcomes will be app usability, acceptability, and response rates. Secondary outcomes will be either evaluated in Qualtrics at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up (depression and anxiety severity, and transdiagnostic dimensions of emotional disorders) or daily throughout the study with the app (EMAs of mood and five transdiagnostic mechanisms of therapeutic change). EMIs will consist of brief, evidence-based transdiagnostic CBT digital content (images, infographics, or videos) delivered just-in-time. Only if problems persist, short phone calls or episodic videocalls will be conducted. The Ethics Committee of the Jaume I University approved the study and all its procedures (CD/111/2021) in December 2021.

Discussion

Identifying personalized and scalable interventions is paramount to improve mental health care, especially its accessibility, and to reduce the psychological distress of people with mental health problems. Feasibility data of the app (EMA and EMI system) supported by a self-applied online transdiagnostic intervention will be important to explore whether this modern approach is a real option to move forward personalized psychological interventions for persons with emotional disorders.

Abstract
Individuals’ daily behaviors and social interactions play a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders. Despite this, observational ambulatory assessment methods—research methods that allow for direct and passive assessment of individuals’ momentary activities and interactions—have a remarkably scant history in the clinical science field. Prior discussions of ambulatory assessment methods in clinical science have focused on subjective methods (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and physiological methods (e.g., wearable heart rate monitoring). Comparatively less attention has been dedicated to ambulatory assessment methods that collect objective, relational data about individuals’ social behaviors and their interactions with their momentary environmental contexts. Drawing on extant social-ecological measurement frameworks, this article first provides a conceptual and psychometric rationale for the integration of daily relational data into clinical science research. Next, the nascent research applying such methods to clinical science is reviewed, and priorities for further research organized by the NIH Stage Model for Clinical Science Research are recommended. These data can provide unique information about the social contexts of diverse patient populations; identify social-ecological targets for transdiagnostic, precision, and culturally responsive interventions; and contribute novel data about the effectiveness of established interventions at creating behavioral and relational change.

Background:
Clear health disparities have emerged in the rates of COVID-19 exposure, hospitalization, and death among Black, Hispanic, and American Indian (BHAI) individuals, relative to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. BHAI populations have been disproportionately affected by lower behavioral health access and heightened negative mental health outcomes during the pandemic.


Objective:
This project directly addresses health disparities in access to behavioral health care during the COVID-19 pandemic among BHAI populations via an adaptation of the established, initially validated, low-cost, mobile app Easing Anxiety Sensitivity for Everyone (EASE) among individuals with symptoms of elevated anxiety or depression or both.


Methods:
The EASE trial is a 2-arm, prospective, randomized, blinded-assessor study with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants (N=800; n=200, 25%, Black; n=200, 25%, Hispanic; n=200, 25%, American Indian; and n=200, 25%, NHW) are randomized to receive either EASE or an active comparison condition for anxiety and depression. Participants compete an online prescreener, an enrollment call to provide informed consent, a baseline survey, a 6-month intervention period, and 3- and 6-month postbaseline assessments. Select participants also complete a 3- and 6-month postbaseline qualitative interview via phone or an online platform (eg, Zoom). Participants complete 2 scheduled daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) during the 6-month study period. These twice-daily EMAs guide a just-in-time approach to immediate, personalized behavioral health care.


Results:
Outcomes include reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms and functional impairment at 3 and 6 months postrandomization. We also will examine putative mechanisms (eg, anxiety sensitivity [AS] and COVID-19–specific stress and fear) of the intervention effects. Further, as treatment effects may differ across sociocultural factors, perceived discrimination, social support, and socioeconomic status (SES) will be evaluated as potential moderators of treatment effects on the primary outcomes. Process evaluation using data collected during the study, as well as individual interviews with participants, will complement quantitative data.


Conclusions:
Data from this efficacy trial will determine whether EASE successfully improves symptoms of anxiety and depression and whether these improvements outperform an active comparison control app. If successful, findings from this study have the potential to decrease anxiety and depression symptoms among vulnerable populations determined to be most at risk of exacerbated, long-lasting negative health sequelae. Data from this study may be used to support an implementation and dissemination trial of EASE within real-world behavioral health and social service settings.

Abstract

Objectives

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years; however, an improved understanding of how to minimise (selective) non-adherence is needed.

Methods

We examined a range of respondent characteristics predictors of adherence (defined as the number of EMA surveys completed) in the D2M EMA study. Participants were a sample of n = 255 individuals drawn from the longitudinal z-proso cohort who completed up to 4 EMA surveys per day for a period of 2 weeks.

Results

In unadjusted analyses, lower moral shame, lower self-control, lower levels of self-injury, and higher levels of aggression, tobacco use, psychopathy, and delinquency were associated with lower adherence. In fully adjusted analyses with predictors selected using lasso, only alcohol use was related to adherence: beer and alcopops to higher adherence and spirits to lower adherence.

Conclusions

These findings provide potential insights into some of the psychological mechanisms that may underlie adherence in EMA. They also point to respondent characteristics for which additional or tailored efforts may be needed to promote adherence.

Abstract
One crucial factor that leads to disparities in smoking cessation between groups with higher and lower socioeconomic status is more prevalent socioenvironmental smoking cues in low-income communities. Little is known about how these cues influence socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers in real-world scenarios and how to design interventions, especially mobile phone–based interventions, to counteract the impacts of various types of smoking cues. We interviewed 15 current smokers living in low-income communities and scanned their neighborhoods to explore smoking-related experiences and identify multilevel cues that may trigger them to smoke. Findings suggest four major types of smoking cues influence low-income smokers—internal, habitual, social, and environmental. We propose an ecological model of smoking cues to inform the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for smoking cessation. We suggest that user-triggered strategies will be most useful to address internal cues; server-triggered strategies will be most suitable in changing perceived social norms of smoking and routine smoking activities to address social and habitual cues; and context-triggered strategies will be most effective for counteracting environmental cues. The pros and cons of each approach are discussed regarding their cost-effectiveness, the potential to provide personalized assistance, and scale.

However, no previous studies have trialed EMAI in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed EMAI acceptability and feasibility, including participant retention and response rate, in a prospective, parallel group, randomized pilot trial in Rakai, Uganda comparing behavioral outcomes among adults submitting ecological momentary assessments (EMA) versus EMAI. After training, participants submitted EMA data on five nutrition and health risk behaviors over a 90-day period using a smartphone-based application utilizing prompt-based, participant-initiated, and geospatial coordinate data collection, with study coordinator support and incentives for >50% completion. Included behaviors and associated EMAI-arm intervention messages were selected to pilot a range of EMAI applications. Acceptability was measured on questionnaires. We estimated the association between high response rate and participant characteristics and conducted thematic analysis characterizing participant experiences.

Background:
Recent research has investigated the utility of mobile phone–delivered interventions for reducing risky single-occasion drinking, also known as binge drinking. In the past five years, focus has been placed on ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which aim to deliver intervention content in correspondence to real-time assessments of behavior, also known as ecological momentary assessments (EMAs).


Objective:
This study aims to assess the effect of a fully automated, tailored, mobile phone–delivered EMI termed Mobile Intervention for Drinking in Young people (MIDY) on young people's risky single-occasion drinking behavior.


Methods:
We will use a three-armed randomized controlled trial design to determine the impact of MIDY on peak consumption of alcohol among young people. A list of mobile telephone numbers for random digit dialing will be generated, and researchers will telephone potential participants to screen for eligibility. Participants will be randomized into one of three intervention groups. For 6 weeks, EMI, EMA, and attention control groups will complete hourly EMA surveys on their mobile phones on Friday and Saturday nights. EMI participants will receive personalized feedback in the form of text messages corresponding to their EMA survey responses, which focus on alcohol consumption, spending, and mood. EMA participants will not receive feedback. A third group will also complete EMA and receive feedback text messages at the same time intervals, but these will be focused on sedentary behavior and technology use. All groups will also complete a short survey on Saturday and Sunday mornings, with the primary outcome measure taken on Sunday mornings. A more detailed survey will be sent on the final Sunday of the 6-week period, and then again 1 year after recruitment.

The primary outcome measure will be an observed change (ie, reduction) in the mean peak number of drinks consumed in a single night over the 6-week intervention period between the EMI and attention control groups as measured in the weekly EMA. We expect to see a greater reduction in mean peak drinking in the EMI group compared to that in the attention control group. As a secondary aim, we will assess whether mean peak drinking is reduced in the EMA group compared to the attention control group. We will use a random-effects mixed-modeling approach using maximum-likelihood estimation to provide estimates of differences in peak drinking across time periods between those receiving the intervention (EMI) and attention control participants. An intention-to-treat approach will be taken for the analysis. Individuals and study groups will be modeled as random and fixed factors, respectively.


Conclusions:
This study extends our previous work investigating the efficacy of a mobile EMI (MIDY) for reducing risky drinking among young adults in Australia, and will add to the expanding literature on the use of mobile interventions for reducing risky alcohol consumption.

Existing studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress. Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents’ appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants’ cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the psychological distress of parents of children with ASD.

Method

The proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor (chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be participants’ psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants’ subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale. Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive appraisal, and psychological distress.

Discussion

The potential benefit of the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants suffering from other psychological issues in the future.

Background:
Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at a disproportionate risk for HIV infection and common mental disorders worldwide. In the context of HIV, common mental disorders are important and are frequent drivers of suboptimal prevention and treatment outcomes. Mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), or the repeated sampling of people’s behaviors and psychological states in their daily lives using mobile phones, can clarify the triggers and HIV-related sequelae of depressive-anxious symptoms and contribute toward the design of ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) that cater to the contextually varying needs of individuals to optimize prevention and treatment outcomes.


Objective:
This study aims to characterize the feasibility and acceptability of mobile EMA among high-risk MSM in Hanoi, Vietnam. It aims to evaluate the perceived relevance, usability, and concerns of this group with regard to the content and delivery of mobile EMA and the potential of leveraging such platforms in the future to deliver EMIs.


Methods:
Between January and April 2018, a total of 46 participants were recruited. The participants completed 6 to 8 mobile EMA surveys daily for 7 days. Surveys occurred once upon waking, 4 to 6 times throughout the day, and once before sleeping. All surveys queried participants’ perceived safety, social interactions, psychological state, and mental health symptoms. The morning survey further queried on sleep and medication use within the past 24 hours, whereas the night survey queried on sexual activity and substance use and allowed participants to share an audio recording of a stressful experience they had that day. At the end of the week, participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the app.


Results:
Participants completed an average of 21.7 (SD 12.7) prompts over the 7-day period. Excluding nonresponders, the average compliance rate was 61.8% (SD 26.6%). A thematic analysis of qualitative interviews suggested an overall positive reception of the app and 5 recurring themes, which were centered on the relevance of psychological and behavioral items to daily experiences (eg, mental health symptoms and audio recording), benefits of using the app (eg, increased self-understanding), worries and concerns (eg, privacy), usability (eg, confusion about the interface), and recommendations for future design (eg, integrating more open-ended questions).


Conclusions:
Mobile EMA is feasible and acceptable among young MSM in Vietnam; however, more research is needed to adapt EMA protocols to this context and enhance compliance. Most participants eagerly provided information about their mental health status and daily activities. As several participants looked toward the app for further mental health and psychosocial support, EMIs have the potential to reduce HIV and mental health comorbidity among MSM.

Purpose: 

The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of audiologists to provide input into development of a smartphone application (app) to document the real-life listening difficulties and the listening environment of hearing aid candidates and users.

Method: 

Two focus groups were conducted. Facilitators utilized a topic guide to generate participants' input and perspectives. The focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were then qualitatively analyzed using content analysis.

Study Sample: 

The study samples were 10 audiologists (seven females) with 2- to 10-plus years of hearing aid fitting experience.

Results: 

Three main categories were identified: (a) The mobile device app could provide meaningful information to help audiologists to counsel their clients, (b) the app could give clients an insight into their hearing difficulties, and (c) the app could help clients to self-manage their hearing condition.

Background:
Cannabis misuse in young adults is a major public health concern. An important predictor of continued use is cannabis craving. Due to the time-varying nature of cravings, brief momentary interventions delivered while cravings are elevated may improve the use of strategies to cope with cravings and reduce cannabis use.


Objective:
The goal of this manuscript is to describe a formative study to develop coping strategy messages for use in a subsequent intervention.


Methods:
Young adults (aged 19-25 years; n=20) who reported using cannabis >10 of the past 30 days recruited via social media participated in this formative study. Participants rated an initial set of 15 mindfulness and 15 distraction coping strategies on a scale from 1 to 4 (very low degree to very high degree) for clarity, usefulness, and tone. They also provided comments about the content.


Results:
Participants found the initial distraction messages slightly clearer than mindfulness (mean 3.5, SD 0.4 and mean 3.4, SD 0.4, respectively), both were comparable in tone (mean 3.2, SD 0.5 and mean 3.2, SD 0.4, respectively), and mindfulness messages were more useful than distraction (mean 3.0, SD 0.5 and mean 2.8, SD 0.6, respectively). Of the 30 messages, 29 received a rating of very low or low (<2) on any domain by >3 participants or received a comment suggesting a change. We revised all these messages based on this feedback, and the participants rated the revised messages approximately 2 weeks later. Participants earned US $10 for completing the first and US $20 for the second survey. The ratings improved on usefulness (especially the distraction items) with very little change in clarity and tone. The top 10 messages of each coping type (mindfulness and distraction) were identified by overall average rating (collapsed across all 3 dimensions: all rated >3.0). The final items were comparable in clarity (distraction mean 3.6, SD 0.4; mindfulness mean 3.6, SD 0.4), tone (distraction mean 3.4, SD 0.4; mindfulness mean 3.4, SD 0.4), and usefulness (distraction mean 3.1, SD 0.5; mindfulness mean 3.2, SD 0.5).


Conclusions:
The inclusion of end users in the formative process of developing these messages was valuable and resulted in improvements to the content of the messages. The majority of the messages were changed in some way including the removal of potentially triggering language. These messages were subsequently used in an ecological momentary intervention.

Stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression are highly prevalent and cause a tremendous burden for affected individuals and society. In order to improve prevention strategies, knowledge regarding resilience mechanisms and ways to boost them is highly needed. In the Dynamic Modelling of Resilience – interventional multicenter study (DynaM-INT), we will conduct a large-scale feasibility and preliminary efficacy test for two mobile- and wearable-based just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), designed to target putative resilience mechanisms. Deep participant phenotyping at baseline serves to identify individual predictors for intervention success in terms of target engagement and stress resilience.

Methods

DynaM-INT aims to recruit N = 250 healthy but vulnerable young adults in the transition phase between adolescence and adulthood (18–27 years) across five research sites (Berlin, Mainz, Nijmegen, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw). Participants are included if they report at least three negative burdensome past life events and show increased levels of internalizing symptoms while not being affected by any major mental disorder. Participants are characterized in a multimodal baseline phase, which includes neuropsychological tests, neuroimaging, bio-samples, sociodemographic and psychological questionnaires, a video-recorded interview, as well as ecological momentary assessments (EMA) and ecological physiological assessments (EPA).

Subsequently, participants are randomly assigned to one of two ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), targeting either positive cognitive reappraisal or reward sensitivity. During the following intervention phase, participants' stress responses are tracked using EMA and EPA, and JITAIs are triggered if an individually calibrated stress threshold is crossed. In a three-month-long follow-up phase, parts of the baseline characterization phase are repeated. Throughout the entire study, stressor exposure and mental health are regularly monitored to calculate stressor reactivity as a proxy for outcome resilience. The online monitoring questionnaires and the repetition of the baseline questionnaires also serve to assess target engagement.

Discussion

The DynaM-INT study intends to advance the field of resilience research by feasibility-testing two new mechanistically targeted JITAIs that aim at increasing individual stress resilience and identifying predictors for successful intervention response. Determining these predictors is an important step toward future randomized controlled trials to establish the efficacy of these interventions.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40359-023-01249-5,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:30uTjebGNpAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Background:
Bipolar II disorder (BD-II) is associated with significant burden, disability, and mortality; however, there continues to be a dearth of evidence-based psychological interventions for this condition. Technology-mediated interventions incorporating self-management have untapped potential to help meet this need as an adjunct to usual clinical care.


Objective:
The objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of a novel intervention for BD-II (Tailored Recovery-oriented Intervention for Bipolar II Experiences; TRIBE), in which mindfulness-based psychological content is delivered via an integrated web and smartphone platform. The focus of the study is evaluation of the dynamic use patterns emerging from ecological momentary assessment and intervention to assist the real-world application of mindfulness skills learned from web-delivered modules.


Methods:
An open trial design using pretest and posttest assessments with nested qualitative evaluation was used. Individuals (aged 18-65 years) with a diagnosis of BD-II were recruited worldwide and invited to use a prototype of the TRIBE intervention over a 3-week period. Data were collected via web-based questionnaires and phone interviews at baseline and 3-week follow-up.


Results:
A total of 25 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments. Adherence rates (daily app use) were 65.6% across the 3-week study, with up to 88% (22/25) of participants using the app synergistically alongside the web-based program. Despite technical challenges with the prototype intervention (from user, hardware, and software standpoints), acceptability was adequate, and most participants rated the intervention positively in terms of concept (companion app with website: 19/25, 76%), content (19/25, 76%), and credibility and utility in supporting their management of bipolar disorder (17/25, 68%). Evaluation using behavioral archetypes identified important use pathways and a provisional model to inform platform refinement. As hypothesized, depression scores significantly decreased after the intervention (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale baseline mean 8.60, SD 6.86, vs follow-up mean 6.16, SD 5.11; t24=2.63; P=.01; Cohen d=0.53, 95% CI 0.52-4.36).


Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that TRIBE is feasible and represents an appropriate and acceptable self-management program for patients with BD-II. Preliminary efficacy results are promising and support full development of TRIBE informed by the present behavioral archetype analysis. Modifications suggested by the pilot study include increasing the duration of the intervention and increasing technical support.

Abstract

Importance  Targeting low self-esteem in youth exposed to childhood adversity is a promising strategy for preventing adult mental disorders. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) allow for the delivery of youth-friendly, adaptive interventions for improving self-esteem, but robust trial-based evidence is pending.

Objective  To examine the efficacy of SELFIE, a novel transdiagnostic, blended EMI for improving self-esteem plus care as usual (CAU) compared with CAU only.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This was a 2-arm, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted from December 2018 to December 2022. The study took place at Dutch secondary mental health services and within the general population and included youth (aged 12-26 years) with low self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [RSES] <26) exposed to childhood adversity.

Interventions  A novel blended EMI (3 face-to-face sessions, email contacts, app-based, adaptive EMI) plus CAU or CAU only.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was RSES self-esteem at postintervention and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included positive and negative self-esteem, schematic self-beliefs, momentary self-esteem and affect, general psychopathology, quality of life, observer-rated symptoms, and functioning.

Results  A total of 174 participants (mean [SD] age, 20.7 [3.1] years; 154 female [89%]) were included in the intention-to-treat sample, who were primarily exposed to childhood emotional abuse or neglect, verbal or indirect bullying, and/or parental conflict. At postintervention, 153 participants (87.9%) and, at follow-up, 140 participants (80.5%), provided primary outcome data. RSES self-esteem was, on average, higher in the experimental condition (blended EMI + CAU) than in the control condition (CAU) across both postintervention and follow-up as a primary outcome (B = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.14-3.50; P < .001; Cohen d-type effect size [hereafter, Cohen d] = 0.54). Small to moderate effect sizes were observed suggestive of beneficial effects on positive (B = 3.85; 95% CI, 1.83-5.88; P < .001; Cohen d = 0.53) and negative (B = −3.78; 95% CI, −6.59 to −0.98; P = .008; Cohen d = −0.38) self-esteem, positive (B = 1.58; 95% CI, 0.41-2.75; P = .008; Cohen d = 0.38) and negative (B = −1.71; 95% CI, −2.93 to −0.48; P = .006; Cohen d = −0.39) schematic self-beliefs, momentary self-esteem (B = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.01-0.57; P = .04; Cohen d = 0.24), momentary positive affect (B = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.01-0.45; P = .04; Cohen d = 0.20), momentary negative affect (B = −0.33; 95% CI, −0.59 to −0.03, P = .01, Cohen d = −0.27), general psychopathology (B = −17.62; 95% CI, −33.03 to −2.21; P = .03; Cohen d = −0.34), and quality of life (B = 1.16; 95% CI, 0.18-2.13; P = .02; Cohen d = 0.33) across postintervention and follow-up. No beneficial effects on symptoms and functioning were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance  A transdiagnostic, blended EMI demonstrated efficacy on the primary outcome of self-esteem and signaled beneficial effects on several secondary outcomes. Further work should focus on implementing this novel EMI in routine public mental health provision.

Abstract

Precision medicine methods (machine learning; ML) can identify which clients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) benefit from mindfulness ecological momentary intervention (MEMI) vs. self-monitoring app (SM). We used randomized controlled trial data of MEMI vs. SM for GAD (N = 110) and tested three ML models to predict one-month follow-up reliable improvement in GAD severity, perseverative cognitions (PC), trait mindfulness (TM), and executive function (EF). Eleven baseline predictors were tested regarding differential reliable change from MEMI vs. SM (age, sex, race, EF errors, inhibitory dyscontrol, set-shifting deficits, verbal fluency, working memory, GAD severity, TM, PC). The final top five prescriptive predictor models of all outcomes performed well (AUC = .752 .886). The following variables predicted better outcome from MEMI vs. SM: Higher GAD severity predicted more GAD improvement but less EF improvement. Elevated PC, inhibitory dyscontrol, and verbal dysfluency predicted better improvement in most outcomes. Greater set-shifting and TM predicted stronger improvements in GAD symptoms and TM. Older age predicted more alleviation of GAD and PC symptoms. Women exhibited more enhancements in trait mindfulness and EF than men. White individuals benefitted more than non-White.

Tobacco use is an important cause of preventable mortality and morbidity worldwide. Only 7% of smokers successfully quit annually, despite numerous evidence-based smoking cessation treatments. An important reason for failure is barriers to accessing appropriate smoking cessation interventions, which can be minimized by technology-delivered interventions, such as ecological momentary interventions. Ecological momentary interventions provide the right type and intensity of treatment in real time, based on ecological momentary assessments of relevant variables. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of ecological momentary interventions in smoking cessation.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, CENTRAL, psychINFO, and ProQuest without applying any filters on 19 September, 2022. One author screened search results for obvious irrelevant and duplicate studies. The remaining studies were independently reviewed by two authors to exclude irrelevant studies, and then they extracted data from the included studies. We collated study findings, transformed data into a common rubric, and calculated a weighted treatment effect across studies using Review Manager 5.

Findings

We analyzed 10 studies with a total of 2391 participants. Assessment methods included exhaled CO analyzers, bidirectional SMS, data input in apps, and hand movement detection. Interventions were based on acceptance and commitment therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Smoking abstinence was significantly higher in participants of intervention groups compared to control groups (RR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.07–1.44, P = 0.004; I2 = 0%).

Conclusion

Ecological momentary intervention is a novel area of research in behavioral science. The results of this systematic review based on the available literature suggest that these interventions could be beneficial for smoking cessation.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:C6nuJzuIqagJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Numerous observational studies show associations between family meal frequency and markers of child cardiovascular health including healthful diet quality and lower weight status. Some studies also show the “quality” of family meals, including dietary quality of the food served and the interpersonal atmosphere during meals, is associated with markers of child cardiovascular health. Additionally, prior intervention research indicates that immediate feedback on health behaviors (e.g., ecological momentary intervention (EMI), video feedback) increases the likelihood of behavior change. However, limited studies have tested the combination of these components in a rigorous clinical trial. The main aim of this paper is to describe the Family Matters study design, data collection protocols, measures, intervention components, process evaluation, and analysis plan.

Methods/design

The Family Matters intervention utilizes state-of-the-art intervention methods including EMI, video feedback, and home visiting by Community Health Workers (CHWs) to examine whether increasing the quantity (i.e., frequency) and quality of family meals (i.e., diet quality, interpersonal atmosphere) improves child cardiovascular health. Family Matters is an individual randomized controlled trial that tests combinations of the above factors across three study Arms: (1) EMI; (2) EMI + Virtual Home Visiting with CHW + Video Feedback; and (3) EMI + Hybrid Home Visiting with CHW + Video Feedback. The intervention will be carried out across 6 months with children ages 5–10 (n = 525) with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (i.e., BMI ≥ 75%ile) from low income and racially/ethnically diverse households and their families. Data collection will occur at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include child weight, diet quality, and neck circumference.

Discussion

This study will be the first to our knowledge to use multiple innovative methods simultaneously including ecological momentary intervention, video feedback, and home visiting with CHWs within the novel intervention context of family meals to evaluate which combination of intervention components are most effective in improving child cardiovascular health. The Family Matters intervention has high potential public health impact as it aims to change clinical practice by creating a new model of care for child cardiovascular health in primary care.

Abstract

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and wearable sensor data have the potential to enhance prediction of suicide risk in real-world conditions. However, the feasibility of this methodology with high-risk populations, including over extended periods, warrants closer attention. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of concurrent EMA and wearable sensor monitoring in young adults after emergency department (ED) care for suicide risk-related concerns. For 2 months after ED discharge, 106 participants (ages 18–25; 81.1% female) took part in EMA surveys (4x per day) and passive sensor (Fitbit) monitoring and completed an end-of-study phone interview. Overall adherence to EMA (62.1%) and wearable sensor (53.6%) was moderate and comparable to briefer protocols. Relative to EMAs (81%), fewer participants completed the full 8 weeks of Fitbit (63%). While lower initial hopelessness was linked to reduced EMA adherence, previous-day suicidal ideation predicted lower Fitbit adherence on the next day. Self-endorsed barriers to EMA and wearable sensor adherence were also examined. Participants tended to report positive experience with the protocol, with majority indicating EMAs were minimally burdensome, reporting that the Fitbit was generally comfortable, and expressing interest in participating in a similar study again. Findings provide support for the feasibility and acceptability of concurrent intensive self-report and wearable sensor data during a high-risk period.

Abstract

Aims

To describe the research protocol for an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) designed to examine patterns of suicidal ideation and relevant psychosocial stress indicators in adults at risk for suicide.

Design

This observational and longitudinal study will collect data for 28 consecutive days.

Methods

A total of 150 adults at risk for suicide will be recruited from a single suicide prevention centre and an outpatient clinic in Korea. Self-report questionnaires will be administrated during weeks 0, 1, 3 and 5. Participants will receive text messages three times a day for 4 weeks prompting them to access an online survey link for daily mood survey including depression, anxiety, stress and suicidal ideation. In addition, for the first 2 weeks, they will wear an actigraphy device designed to collect actigraphic data in terms of sleep patterns and physical activity. Data analyses such as descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, chi-squared statistics and time-series and correlation analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS 26.0 and SAS version 9.3. The study received funding from National Research Foundation of Korea in February 2020. Institutional Review Board approval for our study was obtained in April 2021.

Discussions

This study will yield fundamental information about daily patterns of suicide ideation and psychosocial stress indicators to develop preventive interventions for adults at risk for suicide.

Impact

Our study will contribute to the development of EMAs and interventions for adults at risk for suicide aimed at providing timely and individualized mental health services in a community setting.

Objective: This two-arm randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of a smartphone-based online
platform which incorporates ecological momentary assessments and ecological momentary interventions with the use
of machine learning to reduce psychological distress in working adults. Method: 205 working adults were recruited
from a local company. Eligible participants were randomized into either the intervention (n = 106) or the waitlist
control condition (n = 99). Participants received 4-week smartphone-based personalised psycho-education sessions and
evidence-based exercises related to cognitive behavioural and mindfulness principles, driven by data about emotional
state, mood, and feedback after each exercise. Reduction in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, was examined
as the primary outcome measure. Results: Significant time (before vs. after intervention) by group (intervention vs.
control) interaction effect was found, F (1, 175) = 56.67, p < .001, η²= .25. Participants in the intervention group
reported less depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms after the intervention (M = 14.38, SD = 15.14) than before the
intervention (M = 28.90, SD = 17.99). The attrition rate was 86%. Conclusions: This smartphone-based intervention
leveraging both ecological momentary assessments and ecological momentary interventions and employing machine
learning was effective in reducing distress in working adults. Findings have informed the next phase of this digital
health platform, which will optimize the intervention model via personalization, and contribute to the expanding field
of digital mental health

Objective Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) refers to the repeated sampling of information about an individual’s symptoms and behaviours, enabling the capture of ecologically meaningful real-time information in a timely manner. Compliance with EMA is critical in determining the validity of an assessment. However, there is limited evidence related to how the elderly comply with EMA programmes or the factors that are associated with compliance.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched up to 17 July 2022.

Eligibility criteria We included observational studies on EMA in the elderly reported in English.

Data extraction and synthesis Two investigators independently performed screening and data extraction. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or a third investigator. A systematic review was carried out to characterise the basic characteristics of the participants and EMA programmes. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to assess overall compliance and to explore factors associated with differences in compliance among the elderly.

Results A total of 20 studies with 2047 participants were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the combined compliance rate was 86.41% (95% CI: 77.38% to 92.20%; I2=96.4%; p<0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed high levels of heterogeneity in terms of the methods used to assess population classification, assessment method and assessment frequency, although these may not be the sources of heterogeneity. Meta-regression analysis showed that population classification and assessment period might have a significant impact on heterogeneity (p<0.05). Egger’s test indicated significant publication bias (p<0.001).

Conclusions Compliance with EMA programmes is high in the elderly.

Objective: In this study, we combined ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with traditional clinical follow-up to explore correlates of suicidal relapse in patients with a history of suicidal behavior.

Methods: Over 6 months, we followed up with 393 patients who completed baseline and follow-up interviews and were monitored through smartphone-based EMA via the MEmind app. Recruitment was conducted between February 2018 and March 2020. We recorded the occurrence of clinical suicidal events and EMA suicidal events, the latter defined as extreme scores on questions on passive suicide ideation.

Results: Fifteen percent of participants had a new clinical suicidal event during follow-up (9.2% suicide attempt [SA]; 5.9% emergency referral for suicidal ideation [SI]). Of the 319 participants who installed the MEmind app, 20.7% presented with EMA suicidal events. EMA suicidal events were statistically significantly associated with clinical suicidal events at 2-month follow-up but not at 6-month follow-up. In the Cox multivariate regression model, 5 factors were independently associated with clinical suicidal events: number of previous SAs, SA in the past year, SA in the past month (risk factors), female gender, and age (protective factors).

Conclusions: Our study confirms some of the risk factors classically associated with risk of suicide reattempt, such as history of suicidal behavior, while questioning others, such as female gender. Risk factors associated with EMA events differed from risk factors associated with traditional clinical suicide events, supporting the existence of distinct suicidal phenotypes.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:aDBxwKnCtC4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.psychiatrist.com

Objective: The aim of this article was to review existing documents in the field of mobile-based EMA and EMI, provide an overview of current hot topics, and predict future development trends.

Methods: We conducted a bibliometric study on mobile-based EMA and EMI publications that were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Biblioshiny and CiteSpace were utilized to analyze scientific productions, leading sources, authors, affiliations, documents, research hot topics, keywords, and trend topics.

Results: A total of 2222 documents related to EMA and EMI published between 1992 and 2023 were retrieved. In recent years, scholarly publications have generally increased in mobile-based EMA and EMI research, particularly in the last decade. JMIR mHealth and uHealth (n=86), as well as JMIR (n=73), showed the highest number of publications. The United States (n=1038), Germany (n=218) and Netherlands (n=175) were leading countries. Regarding keyword co-occurrence and trend topics analysis, mental health, health behaviors, and feasibility were hot topics in mobile-based EMA and EMI research. Future research trends included using EMA for tailoring EMI, just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), and digital phenotyping.

Conclusion: This bibliometric study on mobile-based EMA and EMI is a valuable resource for understanding the field’s evolution and future trends. Our analysis indicates that EMA and EMI have great potential in health behaviors and mental health, but implementation should consider feasibility and reactivity issues carefully. Emerging trends include EMA-tailored EMI, JITAI, and digital phenotyping.

Background:
Although ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has been applied in psychological research for decades, delivery methods have evolved with the proliferation of digital technology. Technological advances have engendered opportunities for enhanced accessibility, convenience, measurement precision, and integration with wearable sensors. Notwithstanding, researchers must navigate novel complexities in EMA research design and implementation.


Objective:
In this paper, we aimed to provide guidance on platform selection for clinical scientists launching EMA studies.


Methods:
Our team includes diverse specialties in child and adolescent behavioral and mental health with varying expertise on EMA platforms (eg, users and developers). We (2 research sites) evaluated EMA platforms with the goal of identifying the platform or platforms with the best fit for our research. We created a list of extant EMA platforms; conducted a web-based review; considered institutional security, privacy, and data management requirements; met with developers; and evaluated each of the candidate EMA platforms for 1 week.


Results:
We selected 2 different EMA platforms, rather than a single platform, for use at our 2 research sites. Our results underscore the importance of platform selection driven by individualized and prioritized laboratory needs; there is no single, ideal platform for EMA researchers. In addition, our project generated 11 considerations for researchers in selecting an EMA platform: (1) location; (2) developer involvement; (3) sample characteristics; (4) onboarding; (5) survey design features; (6) sampling scheme and scheduling; (7) viewing results; (8) dashboards; (9) security, privacy, and data management; (10) pricing and cost structure; and (11) future directions. Furthermore, our project yielded a suggested timeline for the EMA platform selection process.


Conclusions:
This study will guide scientists initiating studies using EMA, an in vivo, real-time research tool with tremendous promise for facilitating advances in psychological assessment and intervention.

Abstract

Despite their proliferation, limited knowledge exists regarding possible benefits of brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Propositions that MEMIs could alleviate SAD symptoms and related clinical outcomes remain untested. This trial evaluated a 14-day MEMI for SAD. Participants with self-reported SAD were randomized to MEMI (n = 96) or self-monitoring app (SM; n = 95). Whereas MEMI instructed mindfulness exercises, SM prompted only self-monitoring five times daily for 14 days. Participants completed state-level self-reports of depression, anxiety, and mindfulness pre-post-mindfulness practice and SAD symptoms, worry, depression severity, repetitive negative thinking, and trait mindfulness at pre-randomization, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU). Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted. The MEMI yielded statistically significantly larger improvements in momentary depression, anxiety, and mindfulness (Cohen's d = −0.10–0.11). Although no between-group effects emerged in alleviating SAD fear and avoidance, excessive worry, depression severity, repetitive negative thinking, and trait mindfulness (−0.13–0.15), within-group effects were significantly small-to-large from pre-post and pre-1MFU (−4.62–0.67). A significant reduction in depression severity occurred in MEMI (−0.63–−0.60) but not SM (−0.31–−0.29). Brief MEMI and SM yielded nondifferent sustained effects on SAD, comorbid symptoms, and risk factors, highlighting its potential value within stepped-care delivery settings.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:k-HQBZn03RIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract
Feelings of well-being and happiness fluctuate over time and contexts. Ecological Momen-
tary Assessment (EMA) studies can capture fluctuations in momentary behavior, and
experiences by assessing these multiple times per day. Traditionally, EMA was performed
using pen and paper. Recently, due to technological advances EMA studies can be con-
ducted more easily with smartphones, a device ubiquitous in our society. The goal of this
review was to evaluate the literature on smartphone-based EMA in well-being research in
healthy subjects. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Report-
ing Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searching Pub-
Med and Web of Science, we identified 53 studies using smartphone-based EMA of well-
being. Studies were heterogeneous in designs, context, and measures. The average study
duration was 12.8 days, with well-being assessed 2–12 times per day. Half of the stud-
ies included objective data (e.g. location). Only 47.2% reported compliance, indicating a
mean of 71.6%. Well-being fluctuated daily and weekly, with higher well-being in evenings
and weekends. These fluctuations disappeared when location and activity were accounted
for. On average, being in nature and physical activity relates to higher well-being. Work-
ing relates to lower well-being, but workplace and company do influence well-being. The
important advantages of using smartphones instead of other devices to collect EMAs are
the easier data collection and flexible designs. Smartphone-based EMA reach far larger
maximum sample sizes and more easily add objective data to their designs than palm-top/
PDA studies. Smartphone-based EMA research is feasible to gain insight in well-being
fluctuations and its determinants and offers the opportunity for parallel objective data col-
lection. Most studies currently focus on group comparisons, while studies on individual
differences in well-being patterns and fluctuations are lacking. We provide recommenda-
tions for future smartphone-based EMA research regarding measures, objective data and
analyses.

Background: As mHealth may contribute to suicide prevention, we developed emma, an application using Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention (EMA/EMI).

Objective: This study evaluated emma usage rate and acceptability during the first month and satisfaction after 1 and 6 months of use.

Methods: Ninety-nine patients at high risk of suicide used emma for 6 months. The acceptability and usage rate of the EMA and EMI modules were monitored during the first month. Satisfaction was assessed by questions in the monthly EMA (Likert scale from 0 to 10) and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS; score: 0–5) completed at month 6. After inclusion, three follow-up visits (months 1, 3, and 6) took place.

Results: Seventy-five patients completed at least one of the proposed EMAs. Completion rates were lower for the daily than weekly EMAs (60 and 82%, respectively). The daily completion rates varied according to the question position in the questionnaire (lower for the last questions, LRT = 604.26, df = 1, p-value < 0.0001). Completion rates for the daily EMA were higher in patients with suicidal ideation and/or depression than in those without. The most used EMI was the emergency call module (n = 12). Many users said that they would recommend this application (mean satisfaction score of 6.92 ± 2.78) and the MARS score at month 6 was relatively high (overall rating: 3.3 ± 0.87).

Conclusion: Emma can target and involve patients at high risk of suicide. Given the promising users’ satisfaction level, emma could rapidly evolve into a complementary tool for suicide prevention.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.952865/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:7sLvr9KO0FsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

•

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide.

•

Machine learning and EMA may improve the prediction of depressive symptoms.

•

Our ML model accurately predicted depressive symptoms for 336 out of 370 values.

Abstract

The objective of this study was to predict the level of depressive symptoms in emerging adults by analyzing sociodemographic variables, affect, and emotion regulation strategies. Participants were 33 emerging adults (M = 24.43; SD = 2.80; 56.3 % women). They were asked to assess their current emotional state (positive or negative affect), recent events that may relate to that state, and emotion regulation strategies through ecological momentary assessment. Participants were prompted randomly by an app 6 times per day between 10 am and 10 pm for a seven-day period. They answered 1233 of the 2058 surveys (beeps), collectively. The analysis of observations, using Machine Learning (ML) techniques, showed that the Random Forest algorithm yields significantly better predictions than other models. The algorithm used 13 out of the 36 variables adopted in the study. Furthermore, the study revealed that age, emotion of worried and a specific emotion regulation strategy related to social exchange were the most accurate predictors of severe depressive symptoms. By carefully selecting predictors and utilizing appropriate sorting techniques, these findings may provide valuable supplementary information to traditional diagnostic methods and psychological assessments",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:L5T9Ar9rI10J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Internet and mobile health (mHealth) based interventions are promising potential options
for increasing access to weight loss treatment for the general public (Payne et al., 2015). Many
health-related internet and mobile phone applications are commercially available, free, and
include features for nutrition self-monitoring which is a vitally important self-management
strategy for weight loss. However, adherence to nutrition self-monitoring for internet and
mHealth interventions is poor and research examining the mechanisms of nutrition self-
monitoring behavior is limited (Lieffers & Hanning, 2012). The purpose of the present study is
to improve understanding of self-monitoring behavior by examining the phenomenological
experience of mobile application self-monitoring through ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) during the first two weeks of an internet-based, self-directed weight loss intervention.
Fifty-one participants (19.6% male, 43.1% non-white) were enrolled in a 16-week, self-
directed, online weight loss intervention. Original methods included the use of two different
nutrition monitoring applications; however, due to a technological failure only one application
(MyFitnessPal) was utilized. Participants completed ecological momentary assessments of
nutrition self-monitoring experiences during the first two weeks of the intervention and
continued to use online materials and the nutrition monitoring mobile application for the
remaining 14 weeks. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was utilized to examine within-subject
differences in perceptions and experiences between instances of completed nutrition monitoring
and instances of missed nutrition monitoring. The relationships between aggregated participant
experiences during the EMA period and nutrition self-monitoring over 16 weeks as well as
weight outcomes were examined using correlational analyses.
Compliance for EMA event-continent responding and signaled random prompt
responding was 58% and 70%, respectively. EMA responses immediately following a nutrition
monitoring entry demonstrated increased participant perceptions of goal consistency, diet
success, diet maintenance, less emotional eating, less monitoring burden, and greater negative
affect as compared to random prompt responses related to a missed nutrition monitoring entry.
Participants monitored nutrition for an average of 48.7 days and nutrition monitoring frequency
was associated with EMA compliance as well as participant perceptions of goal consistency, diet
success, and diet maintenance during the first 14 days. Frequency of nutrition monitoring and
perceptions of diet success during EMA were associated with weight change in both completer-
only analyses and intent-to-treat. The results of this study suggest that early nutrition
monitoring experiences such as the perception of goal consistency and diet success are important
factors for engagement in weight loss treatment. However, further research on monitoring
experiences with larger and more diverse samples is needed to determine how these factors
might be used to inform future assessment and intervention.

Background:
Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a major mental health concern. Despite increased research efforts on establishing the prevalence and correlates of the presence and severity of NSSI, we still lack basic knowledge of the course, predictors, and relationship of NSSI with other self-damaging behaviors in daily life. Such information will be helpful for better informing mental health professionals and allocating treatment resources. The DAILY (Detection of Acute rIsk of seLf-injurY) project will address these gaps among individuals seeking treatment.


Objective:
This protocol paper presents the DAILY project’s aims, design, and materials used. The primary objectives are to advance understanding of (1) the short-term course and contexts of elevated risk for NSSI thoughts, urges, and behavior; (2) the transition from NSSI thoughts and urges to NSSI behavior; and (3) the association of NSSI with disordered eating, substance use, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. A secondary aim is to evaluate the perspectives of individuals seeking treatment and mental health professionals regarding the feasibility, scope, and utility of digital self-monitoring and interventions that target NSSI in daily life.


Methods:
The DAILY project is funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (Belgium). Data collection involves 3 phases: a baseline assessment (phase 1), 28 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) followed by a clinical session and feedback survey (phase 2), and 2 follow-up surveys and an optional interview (phase 3). The EMA protocol consists of regular EMA surveys (6 times per day), additional burst EMA surveys spaced at a higher frequency when experiencing intense NSSI urges (3 surveys within 30 minutes), and event registrations of NSSI behavior. The primary outcomes are NSSI thoughts, NSSI urges, self-efficacy to resist NSSI, and NSSI behavior, with disordered eating (restrictive eating, binge eating, and purging), substance use (binge drinking and smoking cannabis), and suicidal thoughts and behaviors surveyed as secondary outcomes. The assessed predictors include emotions, cognitions, contextual information, and social appraisals.


Results:
We will recruit approximately 120 individuals seeking treatment aged 15 to 39 years from mental health services across the Flanders region of Belgium. Recruitment began in June 2021 and data collection is anticipated to conclude in August 2023.


Conclusions:
The findings of the DAILY project will provide a detailed characterization of the short-term course and patterns of risk for NSSI and advance understanding of how, why, and when NSSI and other self-damaging behaviors unfold among individuals seeking treatment. This will inform clinical practice and provide the scientific building blocks for novel intervention approaches outside of the therapy room that support people who self-injure in real time.

Abstract
It is often assumed that changes in state mindfulness coupled with a decrease in intrusive thinking (e.g., rumination or worry) are the crucial ingredients in mindfulness interventions. We investigate this claim by examining within-person day-to-day changes and causal relationships among these changes in state measures of mindfulness, cognitive interference (a measure of intrusive thinking), depression, well-being, stress, sleep, physical activity, and quality of formal and informal mindfulness practice in a four-week randomized controlled mindfulness intervention with a sample of college students using the Koru mindfulness program; n = 55 for intervention, n = 57 for control; mean age = 21.4). The intervention was effective in improving day-to-day state mindfulness, cognitive interference, and sleep (the effects on all three were linear), but the effects on physical activity, depression, and well-being were not significant. Day-to-day mindfulness (the independent variable) was a predictor of change in daily cognitive interference (the mediating variable), which in turn predicted depression and well-being (dependent variables). The beneficial effects of state mindfulness were demonstrable over a lag of four days, suggesting it is indeed a key ingredient in the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions. Physical activity, sleep, and practice quality did not mediate any effects. One clear implication is that maintaining or restoring high levels of mindfulness, for instance by engaging in meditation or in more informal mindfulness exercises, would be of obvious and direct benefit to mental health and well-being.

Background: The rate of individuals with addiction who are currently treated are low, and this can be explained by barriers such as stigma, desire to cope alone, and difficulty to access treatment. These barriers could be overcome by mobile technologies. EMI (Ecological Momentary Intervention) is a treatment procedure characterized by the delivery of interventions (messages on smartphones) to people in their daily lives. EMI presents opportunities for treatments to be available to people during times and in situations when they are most needed. Craving is a strong predictor of relapse and a key target for addiction treatment. Studies using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) method have revealed that, in daily life, person-specific cues could precipitate craving, that in turn, is associated with a higher probability to report substance use and relapse in the following hours. Assessment and management of these specific situations in daily life could help to decrease addictive use and avoid relapse. The Craving-Manager smartphone app has been designed to diagnose addictive disorders, and assess and manage craving as well as individual predictors of use/relapse. It delivers specific and individualized interventions (counseling messages) composed of evidence-based addiction treatments approaches (cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness). The Craving-Manager app can be used for any addiction (substance or behavior). The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the Craving-Manager app in decreasing use (of primary substance(s)/addictive behavior(s)) over 4 weeks, among individuals on a waiting list for outpatient addiction treatment.

Methods/design: This multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare two parallel groups: experimental group (full interventional version of the app, 4 weeks, EMA + EMI), versus control group (restricted version of the app, 4 weeks, only EMA). Two hundred and seventy-four participants will be recruited in 6 addiction treatment centers in France.

Discussion: This RCT will provide indication on how the Craving-Manager app will reduce addictive use (e.g., better craving management, better stimulus control) in both substance and behavioral addictions. If its efficacy is confirmed, the app could offer the possibility of an easy to use and personalized intervention accessible to the greatest number of individuals with addiction.

Background

The literature reveals that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is an important public mental health problem that affects both the patients and their families. Moreover, studies indicate a high prevalence of psychological symptoms and burden in relatives of people with BPD. Therefore, it is necessary to develop useful and accessible interventions specifically addressed to the caregivers. Smartphone interventions with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) offer several potential advantages in this regard. The aims of our study are to test the effectiveness of a combined intervention supported by a smartphone app versus the same intervention supported by a paper-based manual, studying the feasibility and acceptance of both conditions and evaluating the perceptions and opinions of families about both interventions. This paper contains the study protocol.

Method

The design of this study protocol is a randomized controlled trial. A minimum of 116 relatives will be randomly assigned to two conditions: Treatment as usual (TAU) (N = 58) or Treatment as usual + EMI (TAU+EMI) (N = 58), with TAU being the Family Connection program. The primary outcome will be the Burden Assessment Scale. Secondary outcomes will include psychological symptoms, mastery and empowerment, and resilience. Outcomes will be assessed from pre-treatment to post-treatment (3 months). Statistical analyses will be performed using Student's t-tests, mixed models (ANCOVA) and intention-to-treat analysis.

Discussion

The results of this study will provide a basis for future EMA- and EMI-based application interventions for family members of people with BPD and family members of people with other mental disorders who could benefit from the skills taught.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782922000537,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:9KtK_Zb7v_wJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Abstract

Objectives: 

The HEAR-aware project targets adults ≥50 years who were recently diagnosed with hearing loss and declined hearing aids, but were open for support via a smartphone app on different target behaviors (TBs). The HEAR-aware app, based on Ecological Momentary Assessment and Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMA, EMI), contains educational materials (“snippets”) tailored partly to the user’s experienced listening situations. The app aims to increase adults’ TB-specific readiness to take action on hearing problems. The present study focused on examining feasibility regarding three novel aspects: (1) the app’s acceptability, mainly regarding its EMA and EMI elements (compliance, usability, usefulness, satisfaction), (2) psychometric properties of 10 new TB-specific stages-of-change (SoC) measures (test–retest reliability, construct validity), and (3) the potential of tailoring snippets on a person’s SoC.

Design: 

A nonrandomized intervention study including four measurements with 2-week intervals (T0–T3). (1) The intervention period lasted 4 weeks. App usage data were collected throughout (T1–T3). Usability, usefulness, and satisfaction were measured at T3 (n = 26). (2) Reliability concerned T0 and T1 data, in between which no intervention occurred. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated (n = 29). Construct validity was examined by calculating correlations between the different TB-specific scales (at T0), and also between each of them and self-reported hearing disability (n = 29). (3) Person-tailoring by SoC was examined using T0 and T1 data. Linear mixed models were applied to test whether users rated snippets corresponding to their SoC as more interesting and useful than noncorresponding snippets (n = 25).

Results: 

(1) The percentage of participants that complied with the intended usage varied across the five predefined compliance criteria (lowest: 8%; highest: 85%). Median snippet satisfaction scores were reasonably positive (3.5 to 4.0 of 5). Usability was good (System Usability Score, mean = 72.4, SD = 14.3) and usefulness satisfactory (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, mean = 4.4, SD = 1.4), but showed large variance. (2) The 10 TB-specific scales showed fair-to-excellent reliabilities (range ICCs = 0.51 to 0.80). Correlations between the TB-specific scales ranged between −0.17 (p > 0.05) and 0.74 (p < 0.001), supporting only partly overlap between their underlying constructs. Only the correlation between TB-specific readiness for hearing aid uptake and self-reported hearing disability was significant. (3) Correspondence of a snippet’s SoC with the person’s SoC significantly related to “interesting” ratings (p = 0.006). Unexpectedly, for snippets with a lower SoC than the participant’s, further deviation of the snippet’s SoC from the participant’s SoC, increased the participant’s interest in the snippet. The relationship with “usefulness” was borderline significant.

Conclusions: 

(1) Overall usability, usefulness, and satisfaction scores indicated sufficient app acceptability. The high variance and fairly low compliance showed room for improving the app’s EMA/EMI parts for part of the participants. (2) The 10 new TB-specific SoC measures showed sufficient reliability, supporting that they measured different types of readiness to take action on hearing problems (construct validity). (3) The unexpected findings regarding tailoring educational app materials to individuals’ SoC deserve further study.

This study leveraged the availability of comprehensive data on a general young adult population pool of potential EMA participants and used and compared logistic regression, classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest approaches to evaluate respondent characteristic predictors of willingness to participate in the Decades-to-Minutes (D2M) EMA study. In unadjusted logistic regression models, gender, migration background, anxiety, ADHD symptoms, stress, and prosociality were significant predictors of participation willingness and in logistic regression models mutually adjusting for all predictors, migration background, tobacco use, and social exclusion were significant predictors. A CART approach also identified migration status, tobacco use, and prosociality as prominent predictors, forming the basis of the earliest partitions. However, overall, willingness to participate in the D2M EMA study was poorly predicted from respondent characteristics and only slightly improved with the use of random forest analysis. Cross-validation areas under the curve (AUCs) for the best models were in the range of .56-.57.

Abstract

Body dissatisfaction rates continue to remain high, and the consequences remain dire, especially among young women. Traditional media literacy interventions have found success in addressing body image-related constructs, though they are limited in their reach and are often quickly outdated. This study was designed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a media literacy intervention via ecological momentary intervention. This pilot study tested a media literacy intervention delivered via a smartphone app designed to disrupt the connection between media use and body dissatisfaction. Thirty-seven undergraduate women (Mage = 21.17; SD = 2.20) received a 15-day media literacy intervention through a smartphone application. The primary outcomes were completion rates, retention rates, percentage of data points lost to technological errors, and participant feedback. The secondary outcome was change in body dissatisfaction. The retention and percentage of data points lost to technological errors, alongside participants' ratings, indicated that this intervention is feasible and acceptable. Several targets were identified to increase participant acceptance and potential efficacy of the intervention. Trait body dissatisfaction decreased, though not significantly, following the intervention. State body image satisfaction improved significantly from the first day to the last day of engagement with the app. Overall, the intervention was deemed feasible and acceptable, opening the door for future research in which the intervention and its delivery system are improved, and its efficacy is reexamined. Future digital media literacy interventions should focus on building a user-centered app, further reducing participant burden, and testing efficacy in large and diverse samples.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:HMcYPlYDlCUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) affects between 13% and 47% of the population, with a global growth rate of 20.3% within the last 15 years, suggesting that there is a high need for effective treatments. Pain diaries have long been a common tool in nonpharmacological pain treatment for monitoring and providing feedback on patients’ symptoms in daily life. More recently, positive refocusing techniques have come to be used, promoting pain-free episodes and positive outcomes rather than focusing on managing the pain.


Objective:
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility (ie, acceptability, intervention adherence, and fidelity) and initial signals of efficacy of the PerPAIN app, an ecological momentary intervention for patients with CMSP. The app comprises digitalized monitoring using the experience sampling method (ESM) and feedback. In addition, the patients receive 3 microinterventions targeted at refocusing of attention on positive events.


Methods:
In a microrandomized trial, we will recruit 35 patients with CMSP who will be offered the app for 12 weeks. Participants will be prompted to fill out 4 ESM monitoring questionnaires a day assessing information on their current context and the proximal outcome variables: absence of pain, positive mood, and subjective activity. Participants will be randomized daily and weekly to receive no feedback, verbal feedback, or visual feedback on proximal outcomes assessed by the ESM. In addition, the app will encourage participants to complete 3 microinterventions based on positive psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. These microinterventions are prompts to report joyful moments and everyday successes or to plan pleasant activities. After familiarizing themselves with each microintervention individually, participants will be randomized daily to receive 1 of the 3 exercises or none. We will assess whether the 2 feedback types and the 3 microinterventions increase proximal outcomes at the following time point. The microrandomized trial is part of the PerPAIN randomized controlled trial (German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00022792) investigating a personalized treatment approach to enhance treatment outcomes in CMSP.


Results:
Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee II of the University of Heidelberg on August 4, 2020. Recruitment for the microrandomized trial began in May 2021 and is ongoing at the time of submission. By October 10, 2022, a total of 24 participants had been enrolled in the microrandomized trial.


Conclusions:
This trial will provide evidence on the feasibility of the PerPAIN app and the initial signals of efficacy of the different intervention components. In the next step, the intervention would need to be further refined and investigated in a definitive trial. This ecological momentary intervention presents a potential method for offering low-level accessible treatment to a wide range of people, which could have substantial implications for public health by reducing disease burden of chronic pain in the population.

Using experience sampling, we then observed that experiencing a stressful event predicted impulsive behavior. However, experiencing closeness with others—a domain of PTG—was directly associated with perceived social support, and both predicted positive emotional states, which were, in turn, inversely associated with experiencing a stressful event. Further, when experiencing a stressful event, personal strength—also a domain of PTG—was inversely associated with impulsive behavior and was predicted by both perceived social support and positive emotional states. Finally, in a follow-up experiment, we found that an ecological momentary intervention targeting perceived social support decreased impulsivity and increased self-regulation—an aspect of personal strength—in a dose-dependent fashion. Taken together, our findings: (1) support a PTG model for recovery; (2) provide evidence for processes by which close supportive relationships are protective against addiction and relapse; and (3) indicate that self-regulation is responsive to a short in-the-moment perceived social support intervention. We suggest that these findings support the theory that addiction is a social disease in the sense that close personal interactions and supportive relationships: (a) buffer against stress-related impulsivity, thereby protecting against addiction and relapse; and (b) increase personal strength, thereby decreasing the probability of impulsive—including addictive—behavior and promoting recovery.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53740-7,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:4tnqtgAhsKUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.nature.com

Abstract

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of digitalized personalized feedback derived from experience sampling method (ESM) data for improving women's mental health and to explore its potential to become a prevention intervention. In this three-arm, randomized controlled trial, 124 adult women aged 18 to 64 years with mild to moderate depressive and anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to ESM with personalized feedback (ESM-f, 40 women), ESM alone (ESM, 43 women), or no additional intervention (control, 41 women). The ESM-f and ESM groups received six weeks of ESM, but only the former received biweekly individualized feedback. The primary outcome measure was changes in mental well-being as measured by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) from baseline to 8, 12, 16, 20, and 32 weeks and the comparison between the ESM-f and the control group. The ESM-f group experienced a significantly greater decline in DASS-21 total scores compared with the control group while the ESM and control groups had a comparable decline in DASS-21 total scores. ESM-derived personalized feedback can improve women's mental well-being. Additional research is needed to determine its cost-effectiveness, long-term consequences, and efficacy as a preventive intervention for common mental disorders.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:qElwQbrWKcgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Background:
Interest in quitting smoking is common among young adults who smoke, but it can prove challenging. Although evidence-based smoking cessation interventions exist and are effective, a lack of access to these interventions specifically designed for young adults remains a major barrier for this population to successfully quit smoking. Therefore, researchers have begun to develop modern, smartphone-based interventions to deliver smoking cessation messages at the appropriate place and time for an individual. A promising approach is the delivery of interventions using geofences—spatial buffers around high-risk locations for smoking that trigger intervention messages when an individual’s phone enters the perimeter. Despite growth in personalized and ubiquitous smoking cessation interventions, few studies have incorporated spatial methods to optimize intervention delivery using place and time information.


Objective:
This study demonstrates an exploratory method of generating person-specific geofences around high-risk areas for smoking by presenting 4 case studies using a combination of self-reported smartphone-based surveys and passively tracked location data. The study also examines which geofence construction method could inform a subsequent study design that will automate the process of deploying coping messages when young adults enter geofence boundaries.


Methods:
Data came from an ecological momentary assessment study with young adult smokers conducted from 2016 to 2017 in the San Francisco Bay area. Participants reported smoking and nonsmoking events through a smartphone app for 30 days, and GPS data was recorded by the app. We sampled 4 cases along ecological momentary assessment compliance quartiles and constructed person-specific geofences around locations with self-reported smoking events for each 3-hour time interval using zones with normalized mean kernel density estimates exceeding 0.7. We assessed the percentage of smoking events captured within geofences constructed for 3 types of zones (census blocks, 500 ft2 fishnet grids, and 1000 ft2 fishnet grids). Descriptive comparisons were made across the 4 cases to better understand the strengths and limitations of each geofence construction method.


Results:
The number of reported past 30-day smoking events ranged from 12 to 177 for the 4 cases. Each 3-hour geofence for 3 of the 4 cases captured over 50% of smoking events. The 1000 ft2 fishnet grid captured the highest percentage of smoking events compared to census blocks across the 4 cases. Across 3-hour periods except for 3:00 AM-5:59 AM for 1 case, geofences contained an average of 36.4%-100% of smoking events. Findings showed that fishnet grid geofences may capture more smoking events compared to census blocks.


Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that this geofence construction method can identify high-risk smoking situations by time and place and has potential for generating individually tailored geofences for smoking cessation intervention delivery. In a subsequent smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we plan to use fishnet grid geofences to inform the delivery of intervention messages.

Abstract

Anxiety sensitivity (AS), defined as the fear of anxious arousal, is a promising therapeutic target to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom development after trauma exposure. Computerized AS interventions have been shown to be acceptable to individuals with PTSD symptoms and effective in achieving symptom reduction; however, to our knowledge, no research has examined AS interventions initiated in the immediate aftermath of trauma. We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of a brief (i.e., ∼75 min of psychoeducation, ∼2 hr of ecological momentary intervention) smartphone-based AS intervention in a pilot study. Participants were 12 women who presented for emergency care after sexual assault with high levels of peritraumatic PTSD symptoms. Most women who started the intervention completed the majority of it and reported using the techniques provided. Results indicated that participants perceived the intervention as logical and believed it would help in reducing their symptoms. Qualitative feedback was mostly positive but also indicated concern regarding intervention length. Although not the purpose of the study, results indicated medium-to-large, statistically significant decreases in AS, g = 0.74, and PTSD symptoms, g = 1.20. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that this novel smartphone-based intervention targeting AS was feasible, acceptable, and credible in this small sample of women receiving emergency care following sexual assault. Treatment outcome data must be considered in the context of natural recovery; however, these promising preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and credibility data support continuing to pilot the feasibility and potential efficacy of the intervention to reduce AS and prolonged PTSD symptoms.

Motivation and academic performance have been shown to be linked, so improvement in academic motivation or factors that influence it may have the potential to improve academic performance. Academic motivation can fluctuate over a semester or even throughout a day. Even with these fluctuations, some students have the skills to remain motivated to study, attend class, and complete assignments. Yet, some do not, thus, strategies to help these students maintain motivation throughout the semester can have benefits for academic success. The main objective of this study was to understand whether a mobile intervention could be utilized to increase students’ academic motivation, perception of educational value, and use of positive study strategies while improving overall academic performance. Thirty-eight participants from the University of Northern Colorado were recruited to pilot a novel mobile-intervention, with 19 participants being randomized to a control or intervention group. The intervention group received strategies to help them improve their use of study skills and increase their perception of educational value via prompts on a smartphone app. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), data was collected from both groups in their everyday lives, three times a day, over a two-week period. The EMA questions focused on how students study session time, what strategies they used, their self-efficacy toward learning, and their level of motivation in that particular moment. Between group factors such as self-regulation, self-efficacy, and academic performance (e.g., semester GPA) are examined. The results may have future implications for improving academic motivation and overall performance in college students.",https://digscholarship.unco.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=honors,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:sR6aeETNm-YJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",digscholarship.unco.edu

Background:
Individuals can experience difficulties pursuing their goals amid multiple competing priorities in their environment. Effective goal dynamics require flexible and generalizable pursuit skills. Supporting successful goal pursuit requires a perpetually adapting intervention responsive to internal states.


Objective:
The purpose of this study was to (1) develop a flexible intervention that can adapt to an individual’s changing short to medium-term goals and be applied to their daily life and (2) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the just-in-time adaptive intervention for goal pursuit.


Methods:
This study involved 3 iterations to test and systematically enhance all aspects of the intervention. During the pilot phase, 73 participants engaged in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) over 1 month. After week 1, they attended an intervention training session and received just-in-time intervention prompts during the following 3 weeks. The training employed the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) framework for goal setting, along with mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII). Subsequent prompts, triggered by variability in goal pursuit, guided the participants to engage in MCII in relation to their current goal. We evaluated feasibility and acceptability, efficacy, and individual change processes by combining intensive (single-case experimental design) and extensive methods.


Results:
The results suggest that the digital intervention was feasible and acceptable to participants. Compliance with the intervention was high (n=63, 86%). The participants endorsed high acceptability ratings relating to both the study procedures and the intervention. All participants (N=73, 100%) demonstrated significant improvements in goal pursuit with an average difference of 0.495 units in the outcome (P<.001). The results of the dynamic network modeling suggest that self-monitoring behavior (EMA) and implementing the MCII strategy may aid in goal reprioritization, where goal pursuit itself is a driver of further goal pursuit.


Conclusions:
This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a just-in-time adaptive intervention among a nonclinical adult sample. This intervention used self-monitoring of behavior, the COM-B framework, and MCII strategies to improve dynamic goal pursuit. It was delivered via an Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) procedure. Future research should consider the utility of this approach as an additional intervention element within psychological interventions to improve goal pursuit. Sustaining goal pursuit throughout interventions is central to their effectiveness and warrants further evaluation.

Background:
The gender gap in time use and its impact on health and well-being are still prevalent. Women work longer hours than men when considering both paid and unpaid (eg, childcare and chores) work, and this gender disparity is particularly visible among parents. Less is known about factors that could potentially mediate or moderate this relationship (eg, work-family conflict and gender role beliefs). Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) allows for the documentation of changes in momentary internal states, such as time use, stress, or mood. It has shown particular validity to measure shorter-term activities (eg, unpaid work) and is thus useful to address gender differences.


Objective:
The feasibility of the daily EMA surveys in a parent sample will be examined. The associations between time use, well-being, and stress will be examined, along with potential moderating and mediating factors such as gender, gender role beliefs, and work-family conflict. Finally, the act of monitoring one’s own time use, well-being, and stress will be examined in relation to, for example, the quality of life.


Methods:
We conducted a quasi-experimental, nonrandomized controlled trial with 3 data collection methods, namely, online questionnaires, EMA surveys, and qualitative interviews. The intervention group (n=64) will participate in the online questionnaires and EMA surveys, and a subsample of the intervention group (n=6-17) will also be invited to participate in qualitative interviews. Over a period of 1 week, participants in the intervention group will answer daily EMA surveys (4 times per day). In contrast, the control group (n=17) will only participate in the online questionnaires at baseline and after 1 week. The following constructs were surveyed: sociodemographic background (eg, age, gender, and household composition; baseline questionnaire); mediators and moderators (eg, gender role beliefs and work-family conflict; baseline and follow-up questionnaires); well-being, quality of life, and trait mindfulness (baseline and follow-up questionnaires); momentary activity and well-being, as well as state mindfulness (EMA); and feasibility (baseline and follow-up questionnaires as well as interviews). We anticipate that participants will regard the daily EMA as feasible. Particular daily time-use patterns (eg, high paid and unpaid workload) are expected to be related to lower well-being, higher stress, and health-related quality of life. These associations are expected to be moderated and mediated by factors such as gender, gender role beliefs, work-family conflict, and social support. Participants in the intervention group are expected to show higher values of mindfulness, well-being, health-related quality of life, and lower stress.


Results:
Patient recruitment started in November 2023 and ended in mid April 2024. Data analysis commenced in mid April 2024.


Conclusions:
This study aims to provide valuable insights into the feasibility of using EMAs and the potential benefits of activity tracking in various aspects of daily life.

Background:
Theories propose that brief, mobile, self-guided mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) could enhance emotion regulation (ER) and self-compassion. Such changes are posited to be mechanisms of change. However, rigorous tests of these theories have not been conducted.


Objective:
In this assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, we aimed to test these theories in social anxiety disorder (SAD).


Methods:
Participants with SAD (defined as having a prerandomization cut-off score ≥20 on the Social Phobia Inventory self-report) were randomized to a 14-day fully self-guided MEMI (96/191, 50.3%) or self-monitoring app (95/191, 49.7%) arm. They completed web-based self-reports of 6 clinical outcome measures at prerandomization, 15-day postintervention (administered the day after the intervention ended), and 1-month follow-up time points. ER and self-compassion were assessed at preintervention and 7-day midintervention time points. Multilevel modeling determined the efficacy of MEMI on ER and self-compassion domains from pretrial to midintervention time points. Bootstrapped parallel multilevel mediation analysis examined the mediating role of pretrial to midintervention ER and self-compassion domains on the efficacy of MEMI on 6 clinical outcomes.


Results:
Participants demonstrated strong compliance, with 78% (149/191) engaging in at least 80% of the MEMI and self-monitoring prompts. MEMI was more efficacious than the self-monitoring app in decreasing ER goal–directed behavior difficulties (between-group Cohen d=−0.24) and lack of emotional clarity (Cohen d=0.16) and increasing self-compassion social connectedness (Cohen d=0.19), nonidentification with emotions (Cohen d=0.16), and self-kindness (Cohen d=0.19) from pretrial to midintervention time points. The within-group effect sizes from pretrial to midintervention were larger in the MEMI arm than in the self-monitoring app arm (ER goal–directed behavior difficulties: Cohen d=−0.73 vs −0.29, lack of emotional clarity: Cohen d=−0.39 vs −0.21, self-compassion domains of social connectedness: Cohen d=0.45 vs 0.19, nonidentification with emotions: Cohen d=0.63 vs 0.48, and self-kindness: Cohen d=0.36 vs 0.10). Self-monitoring, but not MEMI, alleviated ER emotional awareness issues (between-group Cohen d=0.11 and within-group: Cohen d=−0.29 vs −0.13) and reduced self-compassion acknowledging shared human struggles (between-group Cohen d=0.26 and within-group: Cohen d=−0.23 vs 0.13). No ER and self-compassion domains were mediators of the effect of MEMI on SAD symptoms (P=.07-<.99), generalized anxiety symptoms (P=.16-.98), depression severity (P=.20-.94), repetitive negative thinking (P=.12-.96), and trait mindfulness (P=.18-.99) from pretrial to postintervention time points. Similar nonsignificant mediation effects emerged for all of these clinical outcomes from pretrial to 1-month follow-up time points (P=.11-.98).


Conclusions:
Brief, fully self-guided, mobile MEMIs efficaciously increased specific self-compassion domains and decreased ER difficulties associated with goal pursuit and clarity of emotions from pretrial to midintervention time points. Higher-intensity MEMIs may be required to pinpoint the specific change mechanisms in ER and self-compassion domains of SAD.

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) minimizes recall burden and maximizes ecological validity and has emerged as a valuable tool to characterize individual differences, assess contextual associations, and document temporal associations. However, EMA has yet to be reliably utilized in young children, in part due to concerns about responder reliability and limited compliance. The present study addressed these concerns by building a developmentally appropriate EMA smartphone app and testing the app for feasibility and usability with young children ages 4–10 (N = 20; m age = 7.7, SD = 2.0).

Methods

To pilot test the app, children completed an 11-item survey about their mood and behavior twice a day for 14 days. Parents also completed brief surveys twice a day to allow for parent-child comparisons of responses. Finally, at the end of the two weeks, parents provided user feedback on the smartphone app.

Results

Results indicated a high response rate (nearly 90%) across child surveys and high agreement between parents and children ranging from 0.89–0.97.

Abstract

Usability is important when evaluating products and providing feedback on improving the system and its intern functions. Since the use of mobile intervention has grown in health research, the need for evaluation has increased. This pilot study took place in Kambaland, a rural area of Kenya, where intimate partner violence (IPV) still is a severe problem. 26 male partners with a high risk of committing IPV completed anger management training sessions and a following smartphone intervention. The mobile phase included an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) with the application movisensXS. Participantsshould learn to reflect on their behavior before it comes to violent actions to improve their relationships. After the intervention, they evaluated the usability of the smartphone app using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and other context-specific questions. Moreover, reliable participation was measured by the number of days on which the men took part and the length of participation time. The men rated the intervention with an average SUS score of 69.69. They participated in EMI 91.50% of the time and in EMA 91.38% of the time. The men worked on their if-then plans with an average participation time of 3 minutes and 15 seconds. The results indicated that the anger management intervention was accepted based on regular attendance, but the implementation in the app offers room for improvement

Introduction: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-based smoking cessation intervention may help personalize intervention for smokers who prefer to quit smoking unaided. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of EMA-based phone counseling and instant messaging for smoking cessation.

Methods/design: This is a two-arm, accessor-blinded, simple individual randomized controlled trial (allocation ratio 1:1). Participants will be recruited from community sites and online platforms in Hong Kong. Interventions will be delivered via a phone call and instant messaging. Current adult smokers who (1) self-report no intention to use smoking cessation services and medication in the coming month and (2) have not used smoking cessation services or nicotine replacement therapy in the past 7 days will be recruited. Recruited participants will be randomized to intervention or control groups via an online randomizer. All participants will be required to complete EMAs (five times per day for 7 consecutive days). The intervention group (n = 220) will receive a nurse-led brief phone counseling immediately after the 1-week EMAs and 10-week EMA-based advice via instant messaging applications (e.g., WhatsApp, WeChat). The 10-week EMA-based advice covers a summary of the 1-week EMAs, and tailored cessation support focused on personalized smoking triggers. The control group (n = 220) will not receive any intervention during the same period. The primary outcomes are participants' progression toward smoking cessation assessed by the Incremental Behavior Change toward Smoking Cessation (IBC-S) and biochemically validated abstinence at the 3-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include self-reported and biochemically validated tobacco abstinence at the 6-month follow-up.

Discussion: The findings will provide evidence that the EMA-based tailored smoking cessation intervention can be adapted as a new health promotion strategy for current smokers who are unwilling to use smoking cessation aids.

Abstract

Robust reward sensitivity may help preserve mental well-being in the face of adversity and has been proposed as a key stress resilience factor. Here, we present a mobile health application, “Imager,” which targets reward sensitivity by training individuals to create mental images of future rewarding experiences. We conducted a two-arm randomized controlled trial with 95 participants screened for reward sensitivity. Participants in the intervention group received an ecological momentary intervention—Imager, which encouraged participants to create mental images of rewarding events for 1 week. The control group participants received only ecological momentary assessment, without the instruction to generate mental images. Adherence to Imager was high; participants in the intervention group engaged in 88% of the planned activities. In the follow-up assessment, the intervention group reported less mental health symptoms, mainly in depression (β = −0.34, df = 93, p = .004) and less perceived stress (β = −0.18, df = 93, p = .035), than control group participants and compared with the baseline assessment. Our results show the positive effects of Imager on mental health symptoms. The encouraging effects of the app on mental health outcomes may lead to greater use of ecological momentary interventions in the clinical preventive practice of affective disorders.

Abstract

Background: Ecological Momentary interventions (EMIs) open new and exciting possibilities for conducting research and
delivering mental health interventions in real-life environments via smartphones. This makes designing psychotherapeutic EMIs
a promising step towards cost-effective, scalable digital solutions for improving mental health and understanding the effects and
mechanisms of psychotherapy.

Objective: The first objective of this study is to formatively assess and improve the usability and efficacy of a gamified mobile
application, the InsightApp, for helping people train some of the (meta-)cognitive skills taught in Cognitive Behavior Therapy
and Acceptance Commitment Therapy. The app aims to help people constructively cope with stressful situations and difficult
emotions in everyday life. The second objective of this study is to test the feasibility of using the InsightApp as a research tool
for investigating the efficacy of psychological interventions and the underlying mechanisms.

Methods: We conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, 65 participants (average age: 27 years, range: 19–55 years, female
n=41, 68%) completed a single-session with the app. The intervention’s effects on affect, belief endorsement and propensity for
action were measured immediately before and after the intervention. Experiment 2 assessed the feasibility of running a
randomized controlled trial with the app. We randomly assigned 142 participants to an experimental or a control condition and
interacted with the app for 2 weeks (average age: 37 years, range: 20-78 years, 55% female). Experiment 2 included all outcome
measures of Experiment 1 except for the self-reported propensity to engage in predefined adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.
Both experiments included user experience surveys.

Results: In Experiment 1, a single session with the app decreased participants’ emotional struggle, the intensity of their negative
emotions, their endorsement of negative beliefs, and their self-reported propensity to engage in maladaptive coping behaviors (all
P<.001, average effect size=-0.82). Conversely, participants' endorsement of adaptive beliefs and their self-reported propensity to
act in accordance with their values significantly increased (all P<.001, average effect size=0.48). Experiment 2 replicated the
corresponding findings of Experiment 1 (all P<.001, average effect size=0.55). Moreover, Experiment 2 identified a critical
obstacle to running a randomized controlled trial (i.e., asymmetric attrition) and how it might be overcome. User experience
surveys showed that the app’s design is suitable for helping people apply psychotherapeutic techniques to cope with everyday
stress and anxiety. Users' feedback provided valuable information on how to further improve the app’s usability.

Conclusions: In this article, we presented and tested the first prototype of the InsightApp. Our encouraging preliminary results
show that it is worthwhile to continue developing the InsightApp and to evaluate it in a randomized controlled trial. This could
lead to a highly cost-effective and highly scalable digital solution for studying underlying (meta-)cognitive mechanisms of
mental health, improving people's mental health, and preventing anxiety disorders and depression

As mobile devices have become a central part of our daily lives, they are also becoming increasingly important in research. In the medical context, for example, smartphones are used to collect ecologically valid and longitudinal data using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which is mostly implemented through questionnaires delivered via smart notifications. This type of data collection is intended to capture a patient’s condition on a moment-to-moment and longer-term basis. To collect more objective and contextual data and to understand patients even better, researchers can not only use patients’ input via EMA, but also use sensors as part of the Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) approach. In this paper, we examine how researchers have embraced the topic of MCS in the context of EMA through a systematic literature review. This PRISMA-guided review is based on the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost. It is shown through the results that both EMA research in general and the use of sensors in EMA research are steadily increasing. In addition, most of the studies reviewed used mobile apps to deliver EMA to participants, used a fixed-time prompting strategy, and used signal-contingent or interval-contingent self-assessment as sampling/assessment strategies. The most commonly used sensors in EMA studies are the accelerometer and GPS. In most studies, these sensors are used for simple data collection, but sensor data are also commonly used to verify study participant responses and, less commonly, to trigger EMA prompts. Security and privacy aspects are addressed in only a subset of mHealth EMA publications. Moreover, we found that EMA adherence was negatively correlated with the total number of prompts and was higher in studies using a microinteraction-based EMA (
𝜇
EMA) approach as well as in studies utilizing sensors. Overall, we envision that the potential of the technological capabilities of smartphones and sensors could be better exploited in future, more automated approaches.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/2/472,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:KavufL45CtAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.mdpi.com

To face this challenge, we developed emma, an app for Ecological Momentary Assessment/Intervention (EMA/EMI) and prediction of suicide risk in high risk patients. Objective: We wanted to test the feasibility of implementing this mHealth-based suicide risk assessment and prevention tool and its impact in subjects at high risk of suicide in real world conditions. Methods: The EMMA Study is an ongoing longitudinal interventional multicenter trial in which patients at high-risk for suicide (n=100) use emma for 6 months. During this period, they complete four EMA types (daily, weekly, monthly, spontaneous) and may use EMI modules. Participants undergo clinical assessment at month 0, 1, 3 and 6 after inclusion. Results: Among the 43 patients already recruited in the EMMA Study, 14 participants had completed the follow-up. Their data were analyzed to evaluate emma implementation and impact on suicide risk management. EMA completion rates were extremely heterogeneous among the 14 participants with a sharp decrease over time. The completion rates of the weekly EMA (25% to 87.5%) were higher than for the daily EMA (0% to 53.3%). Most patients (n=10/14) answered the EMA questionnaires spontaneously. Similarly, the Safety Plan Modules use was very heterogeneous (2 to 75 times). Specifically, 11 patients used the Call Module (1 to 29 times), designed by our team to help them to get in touch with healthcare professionals and/or relatives during a crisis. All patients used the Breathing Space Module and 8 the Emotion Regulation Module (1 to 46 times). The diversity of patient profiles and use of the EMA and EMI modules proposed by emma was highlighted by three case reports.

Although efficacious, many children (40-50%) do not show a significant reduction in symptoms and/or full recovery from primary anxiety diagnoses. Children may fail to improve because they do not fully understand or apply the skills learned in the clinic to their daily life. Homework is routinely assigned in CBT with the goal of generalizing skills beyond the therapy session. Many children however, are likely to struggle with homework completion due to a variety of reasons, including (1) lack of motivation, (2) forgetfulness, and (3) lack of CBT skills understanding. Mobile health (m-Health) gamification provides a potential solution to improving CBT efficacy by delivering more engaging and interactive strategies to facilitate CBT skills practice in everyday life (in vivo).
This dissertation describes both the process of redesigning an existing m-Health system entitled Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment (SmartCAT 1.0) and the utilization of the redesigned SmartCAT (SmartCAT 2.0) in brief (8-session) CBT (BCBT) clinical trial. SmartCAT consists of a smartphone app, and a therapist portal.
Results from the clinical implementation indicate that the app was frequently used throughout the treatment. On average, anxious children spent 40.43 minutes on the app (SD=55.51) completing 13.93 activities per session (SD=11.23). At the .10 level, the app usage of SmartCAT 2.0 (Median=82.5) was higher than that of SmartCAT 1.0 (Median=39), U=34.00, p<.01, Cohen’s r=.52.

Post-treatment analysis revealed that remission of anxiety was not associated with app usage patterns, behaviors, patient demographics, and clinical characteristics. On average, the therapist visited the portal twice per week, spending an average of 5.5 minutes per visit, per patient.
In conclusion, SmartCAT 2.0 showed good acceptability, usefulness, and engagement among anxious youth receiving BCBT treatment.

Background:
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has become a popular mobile health study design to understand the lived experiences of dynamic environments. The numerous study design choices available to EMA researchers, however, may quickly increase participant burden and could affect overall adherence, which could limit the usability of the collected data.


Objective:
This study quantifies what study design, participant attributes, and momentary factors may affect self-reported burden and adherence.


Methods:
The EMA from the Phase 1 Family Matters Study (n=150 adult Black, Hmong, Latino or Latina, Native American, Somali, and White caregivers; n=1392 observation days) was examined to understand how participant self-reported survey burden was related to both design and momentary antecedents of adherence. The daily burden was measured by the question “Overall, how difficult was it for you to fill out the surveys today?” on a 5-item Likert scale (0=not at all and 4=extremely). Daily protocol adherence was defined as completing at least 2 signal-contingent surveys, 1 event-contingent survey, and 1 end-of-day survey each. Stress and mood were measured earlier in the day, sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were reported using a comprehensive cross-sectional survey, and EMA timestamps for weekends and weekdays were used to parameterize time-series models to evaluate prospective correlates of end-of-day study burden.


Results:
The burden was low at 1.2 (SD 1.14) indicating “a little” burden on average. Participants with elevated previous 30-day chronic stress levels (mean burden difference: 0.8; P=.04), 1 in 5 more immigrant households (P=.02), and the language primarily spoken in the home (P=.04; 3 in 20 more non-English–speaking households) were found to be population attributes of elevated moderate-high burden. Current and 1-day lagged nonadherence were correlated with elevated 0.39 and 0.36 burdens, respectively (P=.001), and the association decayed by the second day (β=0.08; P=.47). Unit increases in momentary antecedents, including daily depressed mood (P=.002) and across-day change in stress (P=.008), were positively associated with 0.15 and 0.07 higher end-of-day burdens after controlling for current-day adherence.


Conclusions:
The 8-day EMA implementation appeared to capture momentary sources of stress and depressed mood without substantial burden to a racially or ethnically diverse and immigrant or refugee sample of parents. Attention to sociodemographic attributes (eg, EMA in the primary language of the caregiver) was important for minimizing participant burden and improving data quality. Momentary stress and depressed mood were strong determinants of participant-experienced EMA burden and may affect adherence to mobile health study protocols. There were no strong indicators of EMA design attributes that created a persistent burden for caregivers. EMA stands to be an important observational design to address dynamic public health challenges related to human-environment interactions when the design is carefully tailored to the study population and to study research objectives.

Background:
Sexual minority cisgender men and transgender (SMMT) individuals, particularly emerging adults (aged 18-34 years), often report hazardous drinking. Given that alcohol use increases the likelihood of HIV risk behaviors, and HIV disproportionately affects SMMT individuals, there is a need to test interventions that reduce hazardous alcohol use and subsequent HIV risk behaviors among this population. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile phones to deliver risk reduction messages based on current location and behaviors, can help to address triggers that lead to drinking in real time.


Objective:
This study will test an EMI that uses motivational interviewing (MI), smartphone surveys, mobile breathalyzers, and location tracking to provide real-time messaging that addresses triggers for drinking when SMMT individuals visit locations associated with hazardous alcohol use. In addition, the intervention will deliver harm reduction messaging if individuals report engaging in alcohol use.


Methods:
We will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial (N=405 HIV-negative SMMT individuals; n=135, 33% per arm) comparing the following conditions: (1) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption (a smartphone-delivered 4-session MI intervention), (2) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption and Environmental Risk (an EMI combining MI with real-time messaging based on geographic locations that are triggers to drinking), and (3) a smartphone-based alcohol monitoring–only control group. Breathalyzer results and daily self-reports will be used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes of drinking days, drinks per drinking day, binge drinking episodes, and HIV risk behaviors. Additional assessments at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months will evaluate exploratory long-term outcomes.


Results:
The study is part of a 5-year research project funded in August 2022 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The first 1.5 years of the study will be dedicated to planning and development activities, including formative research, app design and testing, and message design and testing. The subsequent 3.5 years will see the study complete participant recruitment, data collection, analyses, report writing, and dissemination. We expect to complete all study data collection in or before January 2027.


Conclusions:
This study will provide novel evidence about the relative efficacy of using a smartphone-delivered MI intervention and real-time messaging to address triggers for hazardous alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors. The EMI approach, which incorporates location-based preventive messaging and behavior surveys, may help to better understand the complexity of daily stressors among SMMT individuals and their impact on hazardous alcohol use and HIV risk behaviors. The tailoring of this intervention toward SMMT individuals helps to address their underrepresentation in existing alcohol use research and will be promising for informing where structural alcohol use prevention and treatment interventions are needed to support SMMT individuals.

Background:
The utility of brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) to improve empathy and theory-of-mind has been underinvestigated, particularly in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).


Objective:
In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to examine the efficacy of a 14-day, fully self-guided, mindfulness EMI on the empathy and theory-of-mind domains for GAD.


Methods:
Adults (aged ≥18 y) diagnosed with GAD were randomized to a mindfulness EMI (68/110, 61.8%) or self-monitoring app (42/110, 38.2%) arm. They completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report empathy measure and theory-of-mind test (Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task) at prerandomization, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU) time points. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted with the intent-to-treat principle to determine prerandomization to postintervention (pre-post intervention) and prerandomization to 1MFU (pre-1MFU) changes, comparing the mindfulness EMI to self-monitoring.


Results:
Observed effects were generally stronger from pre-1MFU than from pre-post intervention time points. From pre-post intervention time points, the mindfulness EMI was more efficacious than the self-monitoring app on fantasy (the ability to imagine being in others’ shoes; between-intervention effect size: Cohen d=0.26, P=.007; within-intervention effect size: Cohen d=0.22, P=.02 for the mindfulness EMI and Cohen d=−0.16, P=.10 for the self-monitoring app). From pre-1MFU time points, the mindfulness EMI, but not the self-monitoring app, improved theory-of-mind (a window into others’ thoughts and intentions through abstract, propositional knowledge about their mental states, encompassing the ability to decipher social cues) and the fantasy, personal distress (stress when witnessing others’ negative experiences), and perspective-taking (understanding others’ perspective) empathy domains. The effect sizes were small to moderate (Cohen d=0.15-0.36; P<.001 to P=.01) for significant between-intervention effects from pre-1MFU time points. Furthermore, the within-intervention effect sizes for these significant outcomes were stronger for the mindfulness EMI (Cohen d=0.30-0.43; P<.001 to P=.03) than the self-monitoring app (Cohen d=−0.12 to 0.21; P=.001 to P>.99) from pre-1MFU time points. No between-intervention and within-intervention effects on empathic concern (feeling affection, compassion, and care when observing others in distress, primarily attending to their emotional well-being) were observed from pre-post intervention and pre-1MFU time points.


Conclusions:
The brief mindfulness EMI improved specific domains of empathy (eg, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective-taking) and theory-of-mind with small to moderate effect sizes in persons with GAD. Higher-intensity, self-guided or coach-facilitated, multicomponent mindfulness EMIs targeting the optimization of social relationships are likely necessary to improve the empathic concern domain in this population.

Abstract

Background
Risky drinking is a significant public health issue in young Australian adults. Brief interventions are one of few effective methods of reducing risky drinking but are time and cost intensive; innovative methods of delivery are therefore of interest. Mobile phones offer new opportunities to collect data and intervene during risky drinking events. Mobile phones have successfully been used for delivery of alcohol-related brief interventions and data collection but not in combination with or during drinking events.

Objective
This pilot study will investigate the efficacy of an ecological momentary intervention (EMI), with combined ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and brief intervention delivered by mobile phones to young adults during risky drinking events.

Methods
We will use a 3-armed randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of the intervention for reducing peak single occasion drinking. Our sample is recruited from an observational cohort study of young, risky drinkers. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 3 intervention arms. On 6 nights across a 12-week study period, EMI and EMA groups will complete hourly EMA surveys on their mobile phone. EMI participants will receive tailored feedback short message service (SMS) texts corresponding to their EMA survey responses. The EMI participants will not receive feedback SMS. A third group will have no contact (no-contact control). All groups will then be contacted for a follow-up interview within 4 weeks of the 12-week study period ending.

Results
The primary outcome is mean reduction in standard drinks consumed during their most recent heavy drinking occasion as measured at follow-up. Secondary outcomes include alcohol consumption over the previous 6 months, experiences of alcohol-related harms, attitudes toward drinking and drunkenness, hazardous drinking and use of tobacco and illicit drugs. A random effects mixed modelling approach using maximum likelihood estimation will be used to provide estimates of differences in mean drinking levels between those receiving the intervention and control participants.

Conclusions
This study is novel in that, unlike previous work, it will intervene repeatedly during single occasion drinking events. Further, it extends previous research in this area, which has applied limited tailoring of message content for SMS-based brief interventions. The findings of this study will contribute to the growing body of evidence to inform the use of mobile health interventions for reducing alcohol consumption and harms.

Abstract
Based on ICT, specifically smartphones and their mobile apps, this exploratory study questions the impact of EMIs on
employees' perceived stress during workdays. A sample of 15 workers, working at least 3 days a week and divided into
one control group (n=5) and one experimental group (n=10), used an EMI application called ""Mon Sherpa"" for one week.
Participants responded to two questionnaires at the beginning of the study: a sociodemographic questionnaire and the
PSM-9 (Psychological Stress Measure). They completed the PSM-9 once again in the middle and at the end of the
experiment to compare the score's evolution depending on the formed groups. Additionally, semi-structured interviews
were conducted with participants of the experimental group (n=9) to identify their perception of the application. The
statistical results indicated no effects of the EMIS. However, interviews indicated somatic, behavioral, and cognitive
evolution throughout the experiment in the field of stress, anxiety, and invasive thoughts. These conflicting results might
be explained by an immediate but not lasting effect of EMIS on work-related stress. It may also be partly explained by
some limitations of the study. More cross-disciplinary and larger research is required.

Abstract
Voice hearing experiences, otherwise known as auditory verbal hallucinations,
involve the perception of sounds or voices in the absence of external stimuli. These
experiences are a common occurrence across many mental health conditions and can be
distressing, impairing, and are associated with poor quality of life. Whilst some people can
effectively manage their voices independently, or even experience them positively, many
seek help from mental health services. For these individuals, evidence-based treatment
approaches typically include a combination of medication and psychological therapy.
Psychological therapy can help people to gain a greater understanding of these experiences,
improve self-management, and minimise their impact on daily living. However, existing
psychological therapies show only moderate effectiveness, and can be difficult to access,
with long wait times, geographical barriers, and prohibitive costs. Many individuals with
persisting mental health problems face these difficulties, highlighting a need for novel and
innovative interventions that are more effective and accessible for those who need them.
When used in conjunction with standard therapies, otherwise known as blended
therapy, digital technologies have potential to support delivery and improve the efficacy of
therapeutic components. Smartphones are particularly promising given ownership is
becoming ubiquitous and they tend to be carried on the person; offering an opportunity to
extend the therapeutic domain to everyday life. Ecological momentary intervention (EMI) is
one application of this, involving the use of mobile devices to deliver interventions at
specified moments in daily life. A related approach called ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) uses mobile devices to assess clinically-relevant phenomenon as it arises in natural
environments. When blended with standard face-to-face therapies, EMI and EMI (EMA/I)
might enhance assessment and promote the implementation of intervention strategies beyond
the therapeutic context. This might lead to more potent interventions that help support people
to self-manage distressing experiences, such as hearing voices. As such, the focus of this
thesis was to examine the potential to harness these technologies as tools within a blended
therapy for hearing voices. Specifically, an intervention was developed that used EMA to
assess predictors of fluctuations in the intensity of voices in their natural environment. EMA-
derived feedback was discussed during face-to-face therapy sessions to inform clinical
formulation. Based on this formulation, tailored, individualised coping strategies were
selected, with personalised EMI prompts then sent to individuals in their daily life. The aim
of this research was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical
efficacy of this approach.
To establish the evidence-base and inform the development of the intervention, the
first thesis paper involved a systematic review of existing literature on the clinical
application of EMA/I in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Findings demonstrated the
early stage of this research, with a small number of studies supporting the feasibility and
acceptability of these approaches for a variety of purposes, and promise for improving
outcomes. Following the systematic review, which provided a rationale for the current
research and details on the typical design of EMA/I studies, an initial prototype of the
intervention was developed, which was also informed by consultation with lived experience
consultants and experts in the field. An initial pilot study with a small number of participants
was conducted to test procedures. Key findings led to refinement of the intervention and trial
protocol, including technical issues that were solved in the next stage of the research. As an
outcome of this piloting, a single case study was published to illustrate the approach and
describe the development. Following this, a trial protocol was published, outlining the
background and details of the methodology used in the main study conducted as part of this
research, namely a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). In line with the overall aim of
this thesis, findings from the pilot RCT supported the feasibility and acceptability of the
intervention, with good engagement and satisfaction rates. Clinical outcomes were
promising, showing the intervention has potential to improve outcomes related to voices,
coping, and awareness, however potentially not overall emotional distress.
This research is the first to examine the use of EMA and EMI within a blended
therapy for psychotic experiences. These technologies were successfully used to support
therapeutic components and ultimately assisted people to more effective self-manage
distressing voice hearing experiences in their daily life. Beyond the potential to enhance
psychological treatments for voices specifically, the model of blending EMA/I with standard
therapies has broader clinical potential beyond psychosis, justifying further research and
development

Gambling is a common activity internationally, but it can become
problematic and lead to significant harms for some people. A reformulated relapse
prevention (RP) model (Witkiewitz & Marlatt, 2009) has been widely cited to
explain the precipitation and maintenance of problem gambling to subsequently
inform prevention and treatment approaches. Components of the RP model lack
ecologically valid empirical assessments, however, due to a reliance on traditional
cross-sectional methodologies that cannot capture transient precipitants of
gambling (e.g., cravings, self-efficacy) nor their dynamic interactions with stable
precipitants of gambling in real-time. In addition, evidence-based face-to-face
treatments for problem gambling face low uptake rates, which indicates a need for
innovative treatment modalities that extend the reach of treatment to moments of
need in SeoSle¶V eYeU\da\ liYeV. ThiV UeVeaUch bUoadl\ aimed Wo adYance Whe
gambling aetiological and treatment literatures by employing ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) and intervention (EMI) methodologies to explore
real-time associations between gambling cravings, self-efficacy, and gambling
episodes to enable the development and evaluation of a targeted real-time
intervention for craving management. Study 1 involved twice-daily EMAs across
a 4-week study period in 97 regular (monthly) gamblers drawn from a larger
gambling prevalence survey in Tasmania, Australia. The results revealed that
gambling cravings predicted gambling episodes; gambling self-efficacy and
gambling duration were reciprocally related; and craving self-efficacy predicted
gambling expenditure. Significant moderation analyses identified that participants
who gambled for positive reinforcement or coping motives, or people with
comorbid substance use, were more vulnerable to the transition between craving
or self-efficacy and gambling behaviour. Study 2 followed on from this
investigation by developing and usability testing the first smartphone-delivered
EMI for gambling craving management (GAMBLINGLESS: CURB YOUR URGE).

Abstract

Background: Sexual minority cisgender men and transgender (SMMT) individuals, particularly emerging adults (aged 18-34
years), often report hazardous drinking. Given that alcohol use increases the likelihood of HIV risk behaviors, and HIV
disproportionately affects SMMT individuals, there is a need to test interventions that reduce hazardous alcohol use and subsequent
HIV risk behaviors among this population. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile phones to deliver risk
reduction messages based on current location and behaviors, can help to address triggers that lead to drinking in real time.

Objective: This study will test an EMI that uses motivational interviewing (MI), smartphone surveys, mobile breathalyzers,
and location tracking to provide real-time messaging that addresses triggers for drinking when SMMT individuals visit locations
associated with hazardous alcohol use. In addition, the intervention will deliver harm reduction messaging if individuals report
engaging in alcohol use.

Methods: We will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial (N=405 HIV-negative SMMT individuals; n=135, 33% per
arm) comparing the following conditions: (1) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption (a smartphone-delivered 4-session
MI intervention), (2) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption and Environmental Risk (an EMI combining MI with real-time
messaging based on geographic locations that are triggers to drinking), and (3) a smartphone-based alcohol monitoring–only
control group. Breathalyzer results and daily self-reports will be used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes of drinking
days, drinks per drinking day, binge drinking episodes, and HIV risk behaviors. Additional assessments at baseline, 3 months, 6
months, and 9 months will evaluate exploratory long-term outcomes.

Results: The study is part of a 5-year research project funded in August 2022 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism. The first 1.5 years of the study will be dedicated to planning and development activities, including formative research,
app design and testing, and message design and testing. The subsequent 3.5 years will see the study complete participant recruitment,
data collection, analyses, report writing, and dissemination. We expect to complete all study data collection in or before January
2027.

Conclusions: This study will provide novel evidence about the relative efficacy of using a smartphone-delivered MI intervention
and real-time messaging to address triggers for hazardous alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors. The EMI approach, which
incorporates location-based preventive messaging and behavior surveys, may help to better understand the complexity of daily

This study investigated the efficacy of an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) targeting body checking behaviors (weighing, mirror checking, and feeling the body for fat). Body checking has been shown to increase body dissatisfaction and play a role in eating disorders. A digitally based intervention delivered in individuals' naturalistic environments has not yet been explored in the literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to combine ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture body checking frequency and an EMI to target body checking. For the current study, 44 female undergraduates with high body checking levels and healthy weight participated in a five-day intervention where they received five messages via their smart phones each day assessing the frequency of body checking. On the final two days of the study, an intervention message was also sent containing cognitive-behavioral strategies for decreasing body checking. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate the relationship between time (within day and across days), body dissatisfaction, and reported body checking. Body checking behaviors increased within each day while decreasing across the five day intervention period. Additionally, analyses of pre to posttest measures found healthy improvements in a number of body image related constructs. These results suggest that targeting body checking behaviors through a brief ecological momentary intervention may be a useful clinical tool.",https://bearworks.missouristate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3381&context=theses,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:z_3j72FWlUQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",bearworks.missouristate.edu

First year university students engage in heavy alcohol use. Concerns around adverse alcohol-related health outcomes has prompted research on methods to reduce alcohol consumption in university students. The current study investigated the effectiveness of a combined Web-Based Intervention (WBI) and Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) on reducing alcohol consumption in first-year university students. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), EMA+WBI, or EMA+WBI+EMI. The WBI consisted of personalized feedback on participants’ alcohol consumption while the EMIs consisted of a combination of social norms, potential alcohol-related consequences, and protective behavioural strategies. To assess the impact of the intervention, participants completed three surveys across the academic year (i.e., pre-university, end of semester 1, end of semester 2) and responded to fortnightly EMA text messages to report their weekend alcohol consumption. Results revealed that alcohol consumption reported by those in the EMA+WBI+EMI and EMA+WBI conditions did not differ from that of participants in the EMA control condition. Further, although participants in the EMA+WBI+EMI condition reported an average of one less harm than those who received the EMA+WBI condition, it was not significantly different from the number of harms reported by those in the EMA control condition.

As students enter the university environment, they are presented with various
commitments that may or may not impede academic performance. With the issues of
student attrition and retention, there is a need to provide further tools for students to use
to monitor their performance. As students’ progress to higher level coursework,
expectations and time commitments increase, and self-regulation of learning becomes
even more important. Researchers may be able to deliver information to help students
with self-regulation of learning by leveraging new affordances in technology in students’
daily lives. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the feasibility and associated
findings of an ecological momentary intervention surrounding self-regulation, motivation
and study strategy utilization. This quasi-experimental study had 49 participants. The
overarching project for this dissertation was a two-week intensive longitudinal design
with a baseline appointment. For the in the moment assessment via a smartphone
application, there were two conditions: an intervention and an assessment-only group.
This dissertation includes two manuscripts. The first manuscript examines
methodological issues related to the feasibility of using multiple types of prompting
(user-initiated and researcher-generated) when utilizing in the moment data collection in
an educational context, specifically factors that may influence participants’ response rates
and compliance to the researcher protocol. The second manuscript examines motivational
and emotional differences of the same participants within a self-regulation intervention
delivered in the moment via ecological momentary intervention. Specifically, I
investigated motivational and emotional factors related to student behavior (as measured
by reports of studying) during the monitoring time period.
In the feasibility paper, I found overall that participants responded to
approximately two prompts a day and that baseline factors such as lower self-control
were associated with greater missing data. I also found discrepancies between responses
to in-the-same-moment study related questions (i.e., participants saying they had not
studied while also reporting a subsequent amount of time spent studying), which
informed which outcomes to use in the content-based manuscript. In the content
manuscript, I found no condition differences between the intervention and assessment-
only groups in regard to the number of user-initiated study sessions, indicating a lack of
compliance to the intervention protocol. I found that academic motivation and anxiety
over time were associated with the probability of reporting studying. Finally, I found
moderate relationships for end of day reports of study times with the in the moment
reports, suggesting a potential rounding bias.
Based upon the results, it appears there were issues with fidelity of
implementation within the protocol. This could be due to the burden placed upon
participants for in the moment data collection, or additional circumstances not measured
within the study. In regard to lower response rates, participant compensation could have
played a role due to the data collection burden. With the majority of data collection
taking place during the latter part of the semester, the time of the study may have
contributed to lower instances of studying as participants for various reasons (e.g., fewer
assessments, already established study practices).There needs to be further refinement to
the intervention protocol to be able to measure studying in the moment including direct
reminders to participants about their study behaviors and ways to further develop the
training protocol for initiating prompts. Additionally, waves of data collection across the
course of the semester will be explored in future work

Theories propose that judgment of and reactivity to inner experiences are mediators of the effect of mindfulness-based interventions on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, no study has tested such theories using brief, mindfulness ecological momentary intervention (MEMI). We thus tested these theories using a 14-day MEMI versus self-monitoring app (SM) control for GAD.

Methods

Participants (N = 110) completed self-reports of trait mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), GAD severity (GAD-Questionnaire-IV), and trait perseverative cognitions (Perseverative Cognitions Questionnaire) at prerandomization, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU). Counterfactual mediation analyses with temporal precedence were conducted.

Results

Improvement in pre–post mindfulness domains (acceptance of emotions, describing feelings accurately, acting with awareness, judgment of inner experience, and reactivity to inner experience) predicted pre-1MFU reduction in GAD severity and pre-1MFU reduction in trait perseverative cognitions from MEMI but not SM. MEMI reduced pre–post reactivity to inner experiences (but not other mindfulness domains) significantly more than SM. Only reduced pre–post reactivity significantly mediated stronger efficacy of MEMI over SM on pre-1MFU reductions in GAD severity (indirect effect: β = −2.970 [−5.034, −0.904], p = .008; b path: β = −3.313 [−6.350, −0.276], p = .033; percentage mediated: 30.5%) and trait perseverative cognitions (indirect effect: β = −0.153 [−0.254, −0.044], p = .008; b path: β = −0.145 [−0.260, −0.030], p = .014; percentage mediated: 42.7%). Other trait mindfulness domains were non-significant mediators.

Conclusions

Reactivity to inner experience might be a mindfulness-based intervention change mechanism and should be targeted to optimize brief MEMIs for GAD.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/68D34F1EE370AFCCE660E4F7625EBCF7/S0924933824017504a.pdf/treatment_condition_as_a_moderator_and_change_in_trait_mindfulness_as_a_mediator_of_a_brief_mindfulness_ecological_momentary_intervention_for_generalized_anxiety_disorder.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:5vCzSL8MTRkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.cambridge.org

Abstract

Compassion-focused interventions represent a promising transdiagnostic approach, but the mechanisms involved in hybrid delivery combining face-to-face sessions and an ecological momentary intervention remain unexplored. The current study aimed at exploring associations of putative mechanisms with clinical outcomes at post-intervention/follow-up and mediation of outcome at follow-up by preceding pre-to post-intervention changes in putative mechanisms. The compassion-focused EMIcompass intervention was applied in an exploratory randomized controlled trial (treatment as usual (TAU) vs. TAU + EMIcompass) with youth with early mental health problems. Data was collected before randomization, at post-intervention and at four-week follow-up. We recruited N = 92 participants, N = 46 were allocated to the experimental condition. After control for baseline levels of the target outcomes, baseline-to post-intervention improvement in adaptive emotion regulation was associated with lower levels of clinical outcomes (e.g. psychological distress b = −1.15; 95%CI = −1.92 to −0.39) across time points. We could not detect indirect effects, but we observed associations of change in self-compassion and adaptive emotion regulation with outcomes at follow-up in the mediation analysis (e.g., β = −0.35, 95%CI = −0.52 to −0.16). If successfully targeted by interventions, self-compassion and emotion regulation may be promising putative therapeutic mechanisms of change.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:haiIuIeQ-WcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.sciencedirect.com

Questions regarding which intervention is most effective in a given individual, when it is best delivered, and what mechanisms of change underlie observed effects therefore naturally arise in this setting. To achieve this, EMI are typically informed by the collection of multivariate, intensive longitudinal data of various target constructs - designed to assess an individual’s psychological state - using ecological momentary assessments (EMA). However, the dynamic and interconnected nature of such multivariate time series data poses several challenges when analyzing and interpreting findings. This may be illustrated when understanding psychological variables as part of an interconnected network of dynamic variables, and the delivery of EMI as time-specific perturbations to these variables. Network control theory (NCT) is a branch of dynamical systems theory that precisely deals with the formal analysis of such network perturbations and provides solutions of how to perturb a network to reach a desired state in an optimal manner. In doing so, NCT may help to formally quantify and evaluate proximal intervention effects, as well as to identify optimal intervention approaches given a set of reasonable (temporal or energetic) constraints. In this proof-of-concept study, we leverage concepts from NCT to analyze the data of 10 individuals undergoing joint EMA and EMI for several weeks. We show how simple metrics derived from NCT can provide insightful information on putative mechanisms of change in the inferred EMA networks and contribute to identifying optimal leveraging points.

Abstract

Background: Many suicide risk factors have been identified, but traditional clinical methods do not allow the accurate
prediction of suicide behaviors. To face this challenge, we developed emma, an app for Ecological Momentary
Assessment/Intervention (EMA/EMI) and prediction of suicide risk in high risk patients.

Objective: We wanted to test the feasibility of implementing this mHealth-based suicide risk assessment and prevention tool and
its impact in subjects at high risk of suicide in real world conditions.

Methods: The EMMA Study is an ongoing longitudinal interventional multicenter trial in which patients at high-risk for suicide
(n=100) use emma for 6 months. During this period, they complete four EMA types (daily, weekly, monthly, spontaneous) and
may use EMI modules. Participants undergo clinical assessment at month 0, 1, 3 and 6 after inclusion.

Results: Among the 43 patients already recruited in the EMMA Study, 14 participants had completed the follow-up. Their data
were analyzed to evaluate emma implementation and impact on suicide risk management. EMA completion rates were extremely
heterogeneous among the 14 participants with a sharp decrease over time. The completion rates of the weekly EMA (25% to
87.5%) were higher than for the daily EMA (0% to 53.3%). Most patients (n=10/14) answered the EMA questionnaires
spontaneously. Similarly, the Safety Plan Modules use was very heterogeneous (2 to 75 times). Specifically, 11 patients used the
Call Module (1 to 29 times), designed by our team to help them to get in touch with healthcare professionals and/or relatives
during a crisis. All patients used the Breathing Space Module and 8 the Emotion Regulation Module (1 to 46 times). The
diversity of patient profiles and use of the EMA and EMI modules proposed by emma was highlighted by three case reports.

Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that it is possible and acceptable to collect longitudinal fine-grained
contextualized data (EMA) and to offer personalized intervention (EMI) in real time to people at high risk of suicide. Patients
have different clinical and digital profiles and needs that require a highly scalable, interactive and customizable app. To become
a complementary tool for suicide prevention, emma should be integrated in the existing emergency procedures. Clinical Trial:

Stress is a ubiquitous risk factor for poor somatic and mental health (Schneiderman et al., 2005). Therefore, effective stress management and stress beliefs are of utmost importance to reduce negative consequences of stress and to reduce dysfunctional coping behavior such as smoking. Various techniques have already been demonstrated to effectively reduce stress, for example techniques from cognitive-behavioral therapy (Ebert et al., 2014), mindfulness-based activities (Goldberg et al., 2021), yoga (Pascoe et al., 2017), and music listening (De Witte et al., 2020). Further, interventions combining various stress management techniques have been shown reduce stress (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction program, MBSR, Kabat-Zinn, 2013). So far, most stress management programs targeted medium- to long term improvements in stress but have not focused on stress management in acute moments of stress in the daily lives of participants. Additionally, many stress management interventions are not applicable in everyday life, not easily accessible for everyone as programs are often costly or are not adaptable to individual preferences of participants. Therefore, we developed an ecological momentary intervention (EMI). It is an individually tailored eHealth prevention program, or short, EPIGRAM, that includes a variety of evidence-based stress-reducing components and strategies presented as individually selectable activities within one app. EPIGRAM aims at 1) training stress management skills as a preventive health intervention, and 2) providing tools for regulating stress in moments of acute stress in everyday life. Further, using modern assessment methods like ecological momentary assessment (EMA) we can adequately capture stress in everyday life and reduce memory bias (Shiffman et al., 2008). Results of a pilot study by our group showed that EPIGRAM was generally feasible, with some aspects of the study design and the technical application still in need of improvement. Moreover, EPIGRAM was effective in reducing average daily stress levels and momentary stress in situations of increased stress in everyday life of undergraduate psychology students (OSF project: https://osf.io/zfh8q/). Even though the sample of the pilot study was not particularly stressed, results revealed stress-reducing effects. We posit that chronically stressed individuals should benefit from such a digital stress management intervention. In the realm of stress-related health issues, medically unexplained symptoms, characterized as somatic complaints without a sufficient medical explanation (Van Den Bergh et al., 2017), are common and impact the daily lives of those affected (Henningsen, 2018). As feasible and evidence-based low-threshold stress management interventions for the daily life of affected individuals are missing, we also specifically target individuals experiencing somatic complaints. Thus, we adapted EPIGRAM based on the results of our pilot study and now want to investigate it in a randomized controlled trial with chronically stressed participants from the general population who also have at least mild somatic symptoms (e.g., joint pain, shortness of breath, dizziness). Our primary aim is to investigate the immediate and intermediate efficacy of EPIGRAM on reducing subjective stress and salivary cortisol levels. Our secondary goals are the investigation of the effects of EPIGRAM on the intensity of and impairment by somatic symptoms, on craving for nicotine-containing products (cigarettes, e-cigarettes), and on stress beliefs. Methods: We will include N = 120 chronically stressed participants with at least mild somatic symptoms from the general population, who will be randomized to an intervention group and a waitlist control group with a 1:1 ratio. The study consists of three phases (baseline, intervention, post). In the baseline phase, participants complete seven days of EMA, in which they answer questions regarding subjective stress, secondary outcomes, a list of control variables, and provide a saliva sample at 11am, 3pm, 7pm. In addition, participants complete a self-triggered evening assessment (no saliva sample). In all phases, participants are also asked to make event-based data entries whenever they feel stressed, followed by event-related questions and saliva sampling directly and 20 min after the entry. In the intervention phase, participants only complete the self-triggered evening questionnaire and the event-based data entries. In the intervention phase, participants in the intervention group actively use EPIGRAM as a smartphone-based EMI for 5 weeks. EPIGRAM offers eight modules aimed at improving stress management skills: (1) breath work, 2) time management, 3) problem solving, 4) mindfulness and relaxation, 5) music and nature sounds, 6) yoga, 7) social support, 8) self-compassion) and a daily diary. Participants can freely choose between the modules and integrated activities and complete them whenever and how often they see fit. Moreover, the intervention group is prompted to use EPIGRAM as a just-in-time intervention in moments of acute stress (event-based data-entries). The control group does not use EPIGRAM and is asked to proceed with their previous activities in moments of acute stress. The post phase is identical to the baseline phase and begins after the end of the intervention phase (post EMA for 7 days). Before the baseline EMA and after the post EMA, participants complete a battery of online questionnaires assessing chronic stress, somatic symptoms, fatigue, stress reactivity, mindfulness, self-compassion, and stress competence.

The present study investigated the use of self-monitoring with goal-directed feedback as an
ecological momentary intervention for reducing the frequency of disordered eating and body
checking behaviors over a two-week period. This study also examined if self-monitoring
significantly reduced baseline eating disorder pathology at post-test. Sixty-seven college-age
women with subclinical eating disorder pathology were randomized into one of three groups: a
non-directed EMI group that engaged in two weeks of self-monitoring (NG-EMI group); a goal-
directed EMI that, in addition to completing the two-week self-monitoring period, received daily
text messages containing goal-directed and psychoeducation; and a control group that completed
only the pre- and post-tests. Participants in the EMI groups were prompted via text message five
times per day to record recent disordered eating and body checking behaviors as well as their
state body dissatisfaction (i.e., BISS) and state negative affect (i.e., PANAS-X). All participants
completed online pre- and post-test measures of body shape concern, global eating disorder
pathology, and body checking and avoidance behavior. EMI participants also reported feasibility
and acceptance of the EMI procedures at post-test. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed greater
momentary disordered eating and body checking significantly predicted greater state body
dissatisfaction and negative affect. Results also suggested both EMI groups reported significantly
fewer disordered eating and body checking behaviors over time. Body checking, but not
disordered eating behaviors, reduced significantly faster in the G-EMI group compared to the
NG-EMI group. The G-EMI group reported less eating disorder pathology at post-test compared
to the NG-EMI group and control group. EMI participants indicated overall feasibility and
acceptance of the self-monitoring intervention. The present results suggested self-monitoring,
specifically with the addition of goal-directed and psychoeducational information, might be an
effective intervention for reducing disordered eating and body checking behaviors over time in
women with subclinical eating disorder pathology. Clinical implications, study limitations, and
future directions for research are discussed

The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (m=70.8%), and outcomes were satisfying by users (m=72.6%). Conclusions: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, hence limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily life. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.",https://psyarxiv.com/r4vwz/download?format=pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:kVQc8gC2YJ8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",psyarxiv.com

Background:
Previous research has identified health disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual women, including increased rates of obesity and binge eating in sexual minority women. Established predictors of binge eating behavior include negative emotions and sociocultural processes; however, these studies are generally conducted in samples of young women where sexual identity is not known or reported. There is a dearth of research evaluating how sexual minority–specific factors (eg, minority stress and connectedness to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community) may affect binge eating in sexual minority women. In addition, no studies have examined these processes in racially diverse samples or considered how intersecting minority identities (eg, Black and sexual minority) may affect eating behaviors.


Objective:
The Health and Experiences in Real Life (HER Life) Project aims to clarify real-world predictors of binge eating in young heterosexual and sexual minority women using ecological momentary assessment. The role of affective, social, and health behavior factors in binge eating will be examined for all women (aim 1), and sexual minority–specific predictors will also be considered for sexual minority women participants (aim 2). Person-level moderators of race, body- and eating-related factors, and sexual minority–specific factors will also be examined to better understand how real-world binge eating predictors may differ for various demographic groups (aim 3).


Methods:
Researchers aim to recruit 150 sexual minority and 150 heterosexual women from across the United States, including at least 50 Black women for each group, using web-based recruitment methods. The eligibility criteria include identifying as a woman, being aged between 18 and 30 years, and having had at least two binge eating episodes in the last 2 weeks. Participants must endorse being only or mostly attracted to men (considered heterosexual) or only or mostly attracted to women or having a current or most recent female partner (considered sexual minority). Eligible participants complete an initial web-based baseline survey and then 14 days of ecological momentary assessment involving the completion of a morning and before-bed survey and 5 prompted surveys per day as well as a user-initiated survey after binge eating episodes. The data will be analyzed using a series of multilevel models.


Results:
Data collection started in February 2021. We have currently enrolled 129 sexual minority women and 146 heterosexual women. Data collection is expected to conclude in fall 2022.


Conclusions:
The Health and Experiences in Real Life Project aims to elucidate potential differences between sexual minority and heterosexual women in within-person factors predicting binge eating and inform eating disorder interventions for sexual minority women. The challenges in recruiting sexual minority women, including the determination of eligibility criteria and considerations for remote data collection, are discussed.

Abstract

Background: There is significant evidence supporting a link between excessive digital
media use and adverse mental health outcomes. Since the average American teenager
spends approximately 7 hours a day using digital media, this relationship has become of
considerable interest in the field of public health. Studies have shown that anxiety and
depression may both be associated with increased screen time as well as with Problematic
Internet Use (PIU). PIU refers to a set of symptoms related to an individual’s inability to
control their use of the Internet and appears to have characteristics of both substance use
disorders and impulse control disorders. However, research on PIU has many limitations,
including the lack of formal diagnostic criteria, unequal gender representation in study
samples, and the relative dearth of studies conducted in adolescents, especially those with
pre-existing mental health issues due to their status as a protected population. This study
aims to address these limitations in existing literature through use of ecological
momentary assessment (EMA), a research method that samples participants in their own
environment repeatedly using one of various data collection methods (e.g. paper and
pencil diary, text message surveys, app-based surveys). The specific aims of this study
were: 1) to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a six-week daily EMA protocol in
a clinical population of adolescents and young adults using a smartphone application, 2)
to describe the relationship between PIU and depression/anxiety in a clinical sample of
adolescents and young adults ages 12-23, and 3) to identify possible relationships on
which to focus future studies of problematic digital media use and psychiatric
symptomatology in this vulnerable population.

Methods: The study enrolled 25
adolescents and young adults ages 12-22 years who owned a smartphone and received
mental health services at a community hospital in the greater Boston area. Participants
were surveyed once a day for six weeks using a smartphone application, mindLAMP, to
record self-report data. The daily survey included validated depression, anxiety, and PIU
scales (the PHQ-8, GAD-7, and PIU-SF-6, respectively) as well as two sub-surveys
inquiring about risky online behaviors and screen time use, and were collected via
mindLAMP surveys. Participants also completed a short exit survey once their study
period concluded. Feasibility was assessed by evaluating the sample-wide mean rate of
response on daily surveys for the six-week protocol, rates of daily survey initiation and
completion, and study completion rate. Acceptability was determined based on whether
this data collection method provided more data than the current standard of care, which
typically involves one meeting per week for psychotherapy. 

Results: 96% of participants
completed the study, and results demonstrated a 39.8% mean response rate, 43.2% mean
survey initiation rate, and 38.5% mean survey completion rate. Type of phone use
(overall rate p=0.029, initiation rate p=0.023, completion rate p=0.037), presence of an
anxiety disorder (overall rate p=0.006, initiation rate p=0.038, completion rate p=0.004),
and presence of co-morbid diagnoses (overall rate p=0.042, completion rate p=0.047)
were significantly related to response rate, whereas age, gender, symptom severity,
presence of an affective disorder, gender dysphoria, or ADHD were not. Regarding
specific aim two, significant associations were detected between symptom scale scores
and PIU and risky online behavior assessment (QUAL) scores such that: PIU-SF-6 and
GAD-7 scores were positively correlated (p=0.032), PIU-SF-6 and PHQ-8 scores were
positively correlated (p=0.050), GAD-7 and QUAL scores were positively correlated
(p=0.004), and PHQ-8 and QUAL scores were positively correlated (p=0.0002). These
results replicate findings in the literature of a significant relationship between anxiety and
depression and both PIU and risky online behaviors. The lack of observed significant
relationship between PIU and QUAL contradicts findings within the literature, and is
possibly due to our small sample size. Significant associations were not detected between
between categorical diagnoses of ADHD, Anxiety Disorders, Affective Disorders, or
Gender Dysphoria and PIU-SF-6 scores.

Conclusions: Results indicate that this EMA
protocol is feasible and acceptable in this population, suggesting that this methodology
may represent a new avenue to conduct research in adolescents and young adults with
mental health concerns and, in the future, deliver treatment to these individuals.
Limitations of this study include small sample size and participant bias in self-report data.
Recommendations for future research include replication of this EMA protocol with a
larger number of participants, incorporating methodologies that address the self-report
bias.

Abstract
The increasing prevalence of smart mobile devices (e.g., smartphones) enables the combined use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and mobile crowdsensing (MCS) in the healthcare domain. This combination not only allows researchers to collect ecologically valid data, but also to use smartphones as well as external sensors to capture the context in which these data are collected. By correlating subjective EMA data collected through self-reports with objective MCS sensor measurements in mobile applications, new valuable insights about participants and patients can be gained. However, the operationalization of EMA and MCS is not clearly defined. In addition, engineering of software systems that enable both EMA and MCS is a challenging endeavor that is accompanied by a multitude of conceptual, legal, architectural, and technical challenges. 

This thesis identifies these challenges based on a literature review and the insights gained in several large-scale, long-term eHealth & mHealth projects. Based on the state of the art, the conceptual and operational foundations of combining EMA and MCS in the healthcare domain are introduced. 
In particular, characteristic requirements for an integrated EMA & MCS platform are elaborated in a structured manner and implemented in a conceptual framework. The framework fosters the operationalization of EMA & MCS endeavors in eHealth & mHealth by leveraging the synergies between the two concepts and providing a holistic view on the overall topic. 
Major aspects of the conceptual framework include the design of a reference software architecture, the management of heterogeneous sensor measurements in MCS, and addressing the specifics of data analysis in the context of EMA & MCS.
Moreover, it is shown how the concepts and artifacts proposed in the thesis were iteratively validated and their practical feasibility was evaluated.
Altogether, the contributions presented by this thesis intend to establish a profound and holistic understanding of EMA, MCS, and their combined use in eHealth and mHealth. The proposed conceptual framework and each of its components contribute to operationalizing EMA & MCS endeavors in generic healthcare scenarios and provide technical support for the entire workflow of realizing EMA & MCS software solutions, from their development to the analysis of EMA & MCS healthcare data.
Finally, the knowledge gained and the artifacts created shall serve as a foundation for new EMA & MCS endeavors and eHealth research in general, for example, in the context of personalized treatments.

First, I aimed to investigate digital markers in the prediction of clinical outcomes. Second, I aimed to examine how early adversity may combine and interact with putative candidate mechanisms in the development of psychopathology. Third, I aimed at the development of a hybrid transdiagnostic intervention for enhancing resilience in youth with early mental health problems. I aimed to explore its reach, putative mechanisms of change involved, and personalised intervention trajectories including context factors (i.e., what works for whom under which circumstances?). In line with the first goal, Chapter II presented the first study, which examined the predictive value of momentary manifestations of negative symptoms as digital markers for clinical outcomes in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis using an experience sampling design. I found evidence for momentary manifestations of negative symptoms, especially social anhedonia, to predict clinical outcomes. Higher levels of momentary manifestations of negative symptoms were associated with higher levels of illness severity and poorer functioning at 1- and 2-year follow-up. This approach offers important insights into service users’ symptoms in the context of their daily life, which are relevant for research and practice. Moreover, subjective experiences of negative symptoms, especially social anhedonia, in daily life may be a promising target for future intervention approaches in the early stages of psychosis. Addressing the second aim, Chapters III and IV presented investigations of stress reactivity and threat anticipation as putative mechanisms linking early adversity with psychopathology. In Chapter III, I examined stress reactivity as a putative mechanism linking childhood trauma with clinical outcomes in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis. Replicating previous findings, childhood trauma modified the effect of daily stressors on negative affect and psychotic experiences. Individuals exposed to higher levels of childhood trauma showed more intense psychotic experiences and stronger increases in negative affect in response to minor daily stressors. In addition, there was some evidence suggestive of the predictive value of stress reactivity for clinical outcomes at follow-up. Some evidence for partial mediation of the association of childhood trauma and clinical outcomes via stress reactivity emerged. Taken together, these findings added evidence to the mediated synergy model and highlighted stress reactivity as a promising target mechanism for ecological momentary interventions. In Chapter IV, I investigated the role of threat anticipation in the development of psychopathology. I found evidence that threat anticipation and experiences of early adversity were associated with psychopathology. In addition, 184 I observed mediation effects for the association between early adversity and psychopathology via pathways through threat anticipation. This suggests the relevance of threat anticipation as a putative transdiagnostic mechanism linking early adversity with psychopathology that may be targeted by prevention and intervention approaches. In line with the third goal, Chapter V presented an intervention manual for a hybrid compassion-focused intervention targeting putative transdiagnostic candidate mechanisms such as stress reactivity and threat anticipation in youth with early mental health problems (i.e., EMIcompass) and provided promising initial evidence on the intervention’s reach. In Chapter VI, I explored putative therapeutic mechanisms of change in the EMIcompass intervention. I did not detect initial signals of a mediation of the effect of experimental condition on clinical outcomes at follow-up via putative therapeutic mechanisms. However, results show that, if targeted successfully, change in self-compassion and emotion regulation may be promising targets for intervention and prevention approaches. To explore personalised intervention trajectories including context factors, Chapter VII presented a realist evaluation of the implementation of EMIcompass. Qualitative results indicated that the EMIcompass intervention worked by strengthening participants’ soothing system and improved their well-being. In addition, there was evidence indicating that the intervention may even improve the functioning of participants’ drive system. The digital delivery format was perceived as facilitating the translation into daily life and lowering the burden of, and barriers to, treatment. The findings may inform the development and implementation of future digital mental health interventions in general and future versions of EMIcompass in particular.",https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/34183/1/Dissertation_Isabell_P%C3%A4tzold.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:Kjg-1lisE9kJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de

Abstract

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a method that allows for data collection in real-time, may offer benefits for communication research. We conducted two EMA studies on different topics (i.e., alcohol and sexual content in media and social media use, emotions, and tanning) in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and completed in-depth interviews (N = 19 and N = 16) following each study. Participants were open to the method and described potential changes in awareness and behavior, which could contribute to changes in data collected and potentially serve as an unintentional intervention. Researchers should consider the intent of their research and possible unintended effects of the questions posed.

Excessive alcohol use is a major public health concern. With increasing access to mobile technology, novel mHealth approaches for alcohol misuse, such as ecological momentary intervention (EMI), can be implemented widely to deliver treatment content in real time to diverse populations. This review summarizes the state of research in this area with an emphasis on the potential role of wearable alcohol biosensors in future EMI/just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) for alcohol use.

Recent Findings

JITAI emerged as an intervention design to optimize the delivery of EMI for various health behaviors including substance use. Alcohol biosensors present an opportunity to augment JITAI/EMI for alcohol use with objective information on drinking behavior captured passively and continuously in participants’ daily lives, but no prior published studies have incorporated wearable alcohol biosensors into JITAI for alcohol-related problems. Several methodological advances are needed to accomplish this goal and advance the field. Future research should focus on developing standardized data processing, analysis, and interpretation methods for wrist-worn biosensor data. Machine learning algorithms could be used to identify risk factors (e.g., stress, craving, physical locations) for high-risk drinking and develop decision rules for interpreting biosensor-derived transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) data. Finally, advanced trial design such as micro-randomized trials (MRT) could facilitate the development of biosensor-augmented JITAI.

Summary

Wrist-worn alcohol biosensors are a promising potential addition to improve mHealth and JITAI for alcohol use. Additional research is needed to improve biosensor data analysis and interpretation, build new machine learning models to facilitate integration of alcohol biosensors into novel intervention strategies, and test and refine biosensor-augmented JITAI using advanced trial design.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:riP75-E25iwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Abstract

Objective: Body dissatisfaction rates continue to remain high and the consequences remain dire,
especially among young women. One sociocultural factor found to contribute to body
dissatisfaction is media use. Traditional media literacy interventions have found some success in
decreasing body image-related constructs, though are limited in their reach and are often quickly
outdated. This study developed and examined a media literacy intervention delivered via a
smartphone app designed to help college women disrupt connection between media use and body
dissatisfaction and negative affect.

Method: Participants included 94 University of Hawai‘i students, randomly assigned to the
intervention group, the app-based control group, or the traditional control group. Participants
using the app received 5 prompts per day for 15 days. The app-based control group self-
monitored while the intervention group both self-monitored and received prompts providing
psychoeducation and activities designed to increase media literacy. Assessment measures were
collected at baseline and again 15 days later.

Results: The intervention produced significant improvements in the intervention group compared
to the control group on measures of fatigue. There were also overall reductions over time in
general negative affect, fear, sadness, guilt, hostility, shyness, general positive affect, joviality,
self-assurance, attentiveness, serenity and critical thinking about media messages that were not
specific to condition. Feedback questions gathered at follow-up from the intervention group
showed that participants rated the intervention as acceptable. Additionally, participants endorsed
learning more about the link between the media ideals and body image.
Discussion: This study provides evidence in support of the feasibility of delivering a media
literacy intervention via a smartphone application. Participation in the study found significant
decreases in types of affect, such as general negative affect, general positive affect, and sadness
from baseline to post-intervention. However, there may be potential for greater change. Study
limitations such as power and challenges with the smartphone application are discussed. Future
directions related to the creation of digital interventions are discussed. Overall, participants rated
the intervention as acceptable, opening the door for future research in which the intervention and
its delivery system are improved, and its efficacy is reexamined

Abstract
Usability is important when evaluating products and providing feedback on improving the system and
its intern functions. Since the use of mobile intervention has grown in health research, the need for
evaluation has increased. This pilot study took place in Kambaland, a rural area of Kenya, where
intimate partner violence (IPV) still is a severe problem.
26 male partners with a high risk of committing IPV completed anger management training sessions
and a following smartphone intervention. The mobile phase included an Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) and Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) with the application movisensXS.
Participants should learn to reflect on their behavior before it comes to violent actions to improve their
relationships. After the intervention, they evaluated the usability of the smartphone app using the
System Usability Scale (SUS) and other context-specific questions. Moreover, reliable participation was
measured by the number of days on which the men took part and the length of participation time.
The men rated the intervention with an average SUS score of 69.69. They participated in EMI 91.50%
of the time and in EMA 91.38% of the time. The men worked on their if-then plans with an average
participation time of 3 minutes and 15 seconds.
The results indicated that the anger management intervention was accepted based on regular
attendance, but the implementation in the app offers room for improvement.

Abstract
Objective

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Ecological Momentary Motivational Enhancement Therapy (EM-MET) in reducing craving and severity of Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) among young adults.

Methods

This multicenter, single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted over a period of 11 weeks. Eighty patients with CUD will be randomly assigned to two equal-sized parallel groups, either the Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) group or the EM-MET group. All participants will receive four individual face-to-face sessions of MET (twice a week). The MET group will not receive any other treatments after these sessions; however, in the EM-MET group, the top triggers of patients will be assessed using mobile-based Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) five times a day within three weeks (after face-to-face sessions) and they will receive a call from the therapist who provides them with EM-MET (in the form of an emergency telephone helpline) as soon as they report experiencing triggers of cannabis use that are assessed using EMA in their everyday lives. Primary outcomes including CUD severity and the severity of craving will be evaluated using the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire and the Self-efficacy and Temptation Scale, respectively. These assessments will be conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and a six-week follow-up.

Discussion

If proven feasible and effective, the results of this study will offer clinicians an evidence-based treatment approach to address craving and dependency in patients with CUD. Moreover, these patients will receive effective treatment in real time and in real life, when and where it is most needed. However, it is important to consider the limitations of this study, such as the specific population studied in Tehran, Iran, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Nevertheless, the implementation of Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) in real-life settings holds promise for timely and effective treatment.

Abstract
Background: mobile applications (apps) facilitate cancer pain ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and provide more reliable data than retrospective monitoring. The aims of this study are (a) to describe the status of persons with cancer pain when assessed ecologically, (b) to analyze the utility of clinical alarms integrated into the app, and (c) to test the feasibility of implementing an app for daily oncological pain monitoring. Methods: in this feasibility study, 21 patients (mean age = 56.95 years, SD = 10.53, 81.0% men) responded to an app-based evaluation of physical status (baseline and breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP)) and mental health variables (fatigue, mood, and coping) daily during 30 days. Results: cancer pain characterization with the app was similar to data from the literature using retrospective assessments in terms of BTcP duration and perceived medication effectiveness. However, BTcP was less frequent when evaluated ecologically. Pain, fatigue, and mood were comparable in the morning and evening. Passive coping strategies were the most employed daily. Clinical alarms appear to be useful to detect and address adverse events. App implementation was feasible and acceptable. Conclusion: apps reduce recall bias and facilitate a rapid response to adverse events in oncological care. Future efforts should be addressed to integrate EMA and ecological momentary interventions to facilitate pain self-management via apps.

The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic comes with a significant mental health burden. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to explore if a brief gratitude approach can relieve the mental health burden in terms of fear of Covid, depression, stress, and anxiety and simultaneously enhance happiness and gratitude among a German non-clinical study sample. The current study is an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) study with a mixed method design to explore the effects of a 16-day gratitude intervention combining an experience sampling method (ESM) with a pre-and posttest design. Results revealed that the gratitude EMI was not associated with reduced fear of Covid, depression, anxiety, and stress or increased gratitude or happiness over time as trait constructs. Of the state constructs, momentary fear of Covid did significantly, but weakly, decrease over time. The other state constructs of sadness, anxiety, stress, grateful mood, gratitude, and happiness did not significantly change over time. Further, results indicated a non-linear dose-response association between the frequency of performing the gratitude exercise and several state constructs. Future studies can integrate a control group with an adaptive just-in-time system to the EMI to tailor the intervention based on the current state feelings of the participants.

Background: Mobile e-health technologies have proven to provide tailored assessment, intervention, and coaching capabilities for various usage scenarios. Thanks to their spread and adoption, smartphones are one of the most important carriers for such applications.

Problem: However, the process of design, realization, evaluation, and implementation of these e-health solutions is wicked and challenging, requiring multiple stakeholders and expertise.

Method: Here, we present a tailorable intervention and interaction e-health solution that allows rapid prototyping, development, and evaluation of e-health interventions at scale. This platform allows researchers and clinicians to develop ecological momentary assessment, just-in-time adaptive interventions, ecological momentary intervention, cohort studies, and e-coaching and personalized interventions quickly, with no-code, and in a scalable way.

Result: The Twente Intervention and Interaction Instrument (TIIM) has been used by over 320 researchers in the last decade. We present the ecosystem and synthesize the main scientific output from clinical and research studies in different fields.

Discussion: The importance of mobile e-coaching for prediction, management, and prevention of adverse health outcomes is increasing. A profound e-health development strategyand strategic, technical, and operational investments are needed to prototype, develop, implement, and evaluate e-health solutions. TIIM ecosystem has proven to support these processes.

Abstract
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can be used to examine the dynamics of suicidal ideation in daily life. While the general acceptability and feasibility of EMA in suicide research has been established, further examination of potential iatrogenic effects (i.e., negative reactivity) and identifying those more likely to react negatively is needed. Participants (N = 82) with current suicidal ideation completed 21 days of EMA (4×/day) and filled in M = 78% (Med = 84%) of the EMA. No positive or negative affect reactivity was observed in EMA ratings over the study period. Retrospectively, most participants rated their experience as positive (69%); 22% indicated mood worsening, and 18% suicidal ideation reactivity. Those with more borderline personality traits, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and higher depressive, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptoms, were more likely to report iatrogenic effects. In conclusion, while high compliance rates and lack of affect reactivity during EMA indicate that EMA is well tolerated in suicide research, a minority of participants may report subjective mood effects in retrospect.

Abstract
The literature reveals that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is an important public mental health problem that affects both the patients and their families. Moreover, studies indicate a high prevalence of psychological symptoms and burden in relatives of people with BPD. Therefore, it is necessary to develop useful and accessible interventions specifically addressed to the caregivers. Smartphone interventions with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) offer several potential advantages in this regard. The aims of our study are to test the effectiveness of a combined intervention supported by a smartphone app versus the same intervention supported by a paper-based manual, studying the feasibility and acceptance of both conditions and evaluating the perceptions and opinions of families about both interventions. This paper contains the study protocol. Method: The design of this study protocol is a randomized controlled trial. A minimum of 116 relatives will be randomly assigned to two conditions: Treatment as usual (TAU) (N = 58) or Treatment as usual + EMI (TAU- +EMI) (N = 58), with TAU being the Family Connection program. The primary outcome will be the Burden Assessment Scale. Secondary outcomes will include psychological symptoms, mastery and empowerment, and resilience. Outcomes will be assessed from pre-treatment to post-treatment (3 months). Statistical analyses will be performed using Student's t-tests, mixed models (ANCOVA) and intention-to-treat analysis. Discussion: The results of this study will provide a basis for future EMA- and EMI-based application interventions for family members of people with BPD and family members of people with other mental disorders who could benefit from the skills taught

Abstract

Objective

The Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) concept was the basis for developing a smartphone application for the real-time report of awake bruxism (AB) activities. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the EMA with a randomised controlled trial designed to compare the frequency of AB reported in two separate single observation points between a group of students monitored over time with an EMA smartphone application and a non-EMA monitored group.

Methods

Sixty-four (N = 64) dental students (22.3 YO [±2.6]; 52F; 12 M) answered the Oral Behaviour Checklist (OBC-1) and were randomised into an EMA-group (EG) and control group (CG). EG were monitored with a smartphone application for AB report during seven consecutive days and completed three EMA monitoring periods (EMA-1, 2 and 3) at one-month intervals. After the third period (EMA−3), both EG and CG answered again the OBC (OBC–2). Descriptive statistics were performed to characterise the sample. Pearson's chi-squared test, Fixer Exact test and post hoc Z test with Bonferroni correction were performed. The study hypothesis was that EMA could influence the AB reported by the participants because it implies an increase in the awareness, self-recognition, and self-control of bruxism behaviours. The level of significance was set at p < .05.

Result

The percentage of participants who changed the report of the activity of clenching their teeth while awake between OBC-1 and OBC-2 was significantly higher among participants in EG, when compared to CG (p = .027). For all other behaviours reported the within- and between-group differences from OBC-1 to OBC-2 were not significant. Clenching and bracing were the most frequently reported, whilst grinding was the less frequent behaviour.

Conclusion

A smartphone-based EMA approach demonstrated be useful to monitor AB over time, increasing individual's awareness, particularly to bracing and clenching behaviours.

Pain is a biopsychosocial phenomenon, resulting from the interplay between physiological and psychological processes and social factors. Given that humans constantly interact with others, the effect of social factors is particularly relevant. Documenting the significance of the social modulation of pain, an increasing number of studies have investigated the effect of social contact on subjective pain intensity and pain-related physiological changes. While evidence suggests that social contact can alleviate pain, contradictory findings indicate an increase in pain intensity and a deterioration of pain coping strategies. This evidence primarily stems from studies examining the effect of social contact on pain within highly controlled laboratory conditions. Moreover, pain assessments often rely on one-time subjective reports of average pain intensity across a predefined period. Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) can circumvent these problems, as they can capture diverse aspects of behavior and experiences multiple times a day, in real time, with high resolution, and within naturalistic and ecologically valid settings. These multiple measures allow for the examination of fluctuations of pain symptoms throughout the day in relation to affective, cognitive, behavioral, and social factors. In this opinion paper, we review the current state and future relevance of EMA-based social pain research in daily life. Specifically, we examine whether everyday-life social support reduces or enhances pain. The first part of the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the use of EMA in pain research and summarizes the main findings. The review of the relatively limited number of existing EMA studies shows that the association between pain and social contact in everyday life depends on numerous factors, including pain syndromes, temporal dynamics, the nature of social interactions, and characteristics of the interaction partners. In line with laboratory research, there is evidence that everyday-life social contact can alleviate, but also intensify pain, depending on the type of social support. Everyday-life emotional support seems to reduce pain, while extensive solicitous support was found to have opposite effects. Moreover, positive short-term effects of social support can be overshadowed by other symptoms such as fatigue. Overall, gathering and integrating experiences from a patient’s social environment can offer valuable insights. These insights can help interpret dynamics in pain intensity and accompanying symptoms such as depression or fatigue. We conclude that factors determining the reducing versus enhancing effects of social contact on pain need to be investigated more thoroughly. We advocate EMA as the assessment method of the future and highlight open questions that should be addressed in future EMA studies on pain and the potential of ecological momentary interventions for pain treatment.

Advances in digital technology have greatly increased the ease of collecting intensive longitudinal data (ILD) such as ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) in studies of behavior changes. Such data are typically multilevel (e.g., with repeated measures nested within individuals), and are inevitably characterized by some degrees of missingness. Previous studies have validated the utility of multiple imputation as a way to handle missing observations in ILD when the imputation model is properly specified to reflect time dependencies. In this study, we illustrate the importance of proper accommodation of multilevel ILD structures in performing multiple imputations, and compare the performance of a multilevel multiple imputation (multilevel MI) approach relative to other approaches that do not account for such structures in a Monte Carlo simulation study. Empirical EMA data from a tobacco cessation study are used to demonstrate the utility of the multilevel MI approach, and the implications of separating participant- and study-initiated EMAs in evaluating individuals’ affective dynamics and urge.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1099517/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1fFT-oSmdjAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

As the global prevalence of trauma rises, there is a growing need for accessible and scalable treatments for trauma-related disorders like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma-related intrusive memories (TR-IMs) are a central PTSD symptom and a target of exposure-based therapies, gold-standard treatments that are effective but resource-intensive. This study examined whether a brief ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol assessing the phenomenology of TR-IMs could reduce intrusion symptoms in trauma-exposed adults.

Participants (N=131) experiencing at least 2 TR-IMs per week related to a DSM-5 criterion A trauma completed a 2-week EMA protocol during which they reported on TR-IM properties three times per day, and on posttraumatic stress symptoms at the end of each day. Longitudinal symptom measurements were entered into linear mixed-effects models to test the effect of Time on TR-IMs.

Over the 2-week EMA protocol, intrusion symptom severity (cluster B scores) significantly declined (t = −2.78, p = 0.006), while other symptom cluster scores did not significantly change. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that this effect was specific to TR-IMs (t = −4.02, p < 0.001), and was not moderated by survey completion rate, total PTSD symptom severity, or ongoing treatment.

Our findings indicate that implementing an EMA protocol assessing intrusive memories could be an effective trauma intervention. Despite study limitations like its quasi-experimental design and absence of a control group, the specificity of findings to intrusive memories argues against a mere regression to the mean. Overall, an EMA approach could provide a cost-effective and scalable treatment option targeting intrusive memory symptoms.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2024/05/16/2024.05.15.24307377.full.pdf,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:fwfBgtKdqwAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.medrxiv.org
