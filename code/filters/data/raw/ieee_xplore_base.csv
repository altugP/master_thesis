Fully or partially electronically supported treatments can relieve the health system and bridge or shorten the waiting time for treatments for patients. In this work we combine our technical expertise with the theoretical foundations of JITAIs in an interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate the appropriate use of theory in building JITAIs in a dynamic system. As a result, we present a highly configurable, generic and modular EMA and JITAI mobile framework which enabled us to generate a cross-platform breast cancer aftercare mobile app in a large-scale German study. The aim is to learn more about the validity, usefulness and feasibility of such mobile-device-assisted studies, taking into account administrative burden as well as user acceptance.

However, significant barriers to the design and adoption of these systems remain, including challenges of user engagement, reporting burden, data validity and honest disclosure. While prior research has examined the feasibility of a variety of EMA systems, few reviews have attended to their design. Through inter-disciplinary narrative literature review (n = 342), this paper presents a characterization of the EMA technology design space, drawing upon a diverse set of literatures, contexts, applications and demographic groups.

For example, healthcare providers can repeatedly sample a person's condition to monitor progression of symptoms and intervene if necessary. There is usually a utility-tolerability trade-off between collecting information at sufficient frequencies and quantities to be useful, and over-burdening the user or the underlying technology, particularly when active input is required from the user. Selecting the next sampling time adaptively using previous responses, so that people are only sampled at high frequency when necessary, can help to manage this trade-off. We present a novel approach to adaptive sampling using clustered continuous-time hidden Markov models. The model predicts, at any given sampling time, the probability of moving to an `alert' state, and the next sample time is scheduled when this probability has exceeded a given threshold. The clusters, each representing a distinct sub-model, allow heterogeneity in states and state transitions. The work is illustrated using longitudinal mental-health symptom data in 49 people collected using ClinTouch, a mobile app designed to monitor people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Using these data, we show how the adaptive sampling scheme behaves under different model parameters and risk thresholds, and how the average sampling can be substantially reduced whilst maintaining a high sampling frequency during high-risk periods.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2020.3031263","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/P010148/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9226077","mHealth;ecological momentary assessment;ecological momentary intervention;digital phenotyping;hidden Markov models;risk prediction;schizophrenia;adaptive sampling","Hidden Markov models;Monitoring;Adaptation models;Biomedical monitoring;Informatics;Real-time systems;Markov processes","Ecological Momentary Assessment;Humans;Mental Health;Mobile Applications;Monitoring, Physiologic;Schizophrenia","8","","39","IEEE","15 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study was a ‘proof of concept’ evaluation to see if, in the context of a manualized stress management program, adding JIT intervention reminders via mobile technology would enhance outcomes more than the provision of random (untailored) reminders (both also relative to a measurement only active control condition). Individuals participated in a stress management course and carried a palmtop computer for 11 days (2 days acclimation and assessment, 1 week intervention, and 2 days post-treatment assessment). For the intervention week participants were assigned to one of three groups and either: (a) only completed self-report assessments multiple times each data (using ecological momentary assessment [EMA]; (b) completed EMA and received random reminders to use stress management skills; (c) completed EMA and received JIT tailored reminders to use stress management intervention elements when high stress or negative affect were reported. Individuals receiving JIT reminders reported stressful events less frequently, lower stress severity, less negative affect, lower levels of a stress biomarker (cortisol), less frequent eating, less alcohol consumption, less smoking and better sleep quality than the other two groups at post-treatment assessment. Tailored mHealth interventions designed in conjunction with ambulatory assessment protocols to provide JIT intervention elements can improve the efficacy of a standard stress intervention above and beyond any effects of simple reminders or over the intervention training. Implications for mHealth and JIT interventions are discussed.","","978-1-5090-3090-3","10.1109/WH.2016.7764561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7764561","","Stress;Mobile communication;Mood;Training;Mobile handsets;Appraisal;Atmospheric measurements","","41","","32","IEEE","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Behavior-context wise intervention is provided to adapt behavior in actionable manner. The interventions are in the form of personalized education, and context-based just-in-time recommendations with enhanced impact through analysis of unhealthy factors of lifestyle. The healthy behavior index supports the quantifications and mapping of behavior-context and status to drive the interventions along with analysis of the change in behavior.

A total of 297 respondents were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=147) or the waiting list group (n=150). The intervention group received access to the intervention for 12 weeks. At pre- and post-test we measured dietary and physical activity behaviour (primary outcomes) and BMI, knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, subjective behaviour and insight in behaviour (secondary outcomes). All participants, regardless of randomized group, show improvement in healthy behaviour and subjective assessment of healthy behaviour. People who are older, score higher on dietary behaviour and under-estimate their dietary behaviour are more likely to use the Healthy Weight Assistant (HWA). Using the HWA leads to improvement in physical activity behaviour and insight in this behaviour.

For the chronic disorder tinnitus, only few long-running intervention studies exist, which use mobile technology in a larger setting. Tinnitus is characterized by its heterogeneous patient’s symptom profiles, which complicates the development of general treatments. In the UNITI project, researchers from different European countries try to unify existing treatments and interventions to cope with this heterogeneity. One study arm (UNITI Mobile) exploits mobile technology to investigate newly implemented interventions types, especially within the pan-European setting. The goals are to learn more about the validity and usefulness of mobile technology in this context. Furthermore, differences among the countries shall be investigated. Practically, two native intervention apps have been developed for UNITI and the mobile study arm, which pose features not presented so far in other apps of the authors. Along the implementation procedure, it is discussed whether these features might leverage similar types of studies in future. Since instruments like the mHealth evidence reporting and assessment checklist (mERA), developed by the WHO mHealth technical evidence review group, indicate that aspects shown for UNITI Mobile are important in the context of health interventions using mobile phones, our findings may be of a more general interest and are therefore being discussed in the work at hand.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630482","","Crowdsensing;Instruments;Europe;Mobile handsets;Biology","Cell Phone;Ecological Momentary Assessment;Humans;Mobile Applications;Telemedicine;Tinnitus","10","","24","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although sensors provide intensive data on the patterns and variations of physical activity over time, the influences of these variations are often unmeasured. Health behavior theories provide an explanatory framework of the putative mediators of physical activity changes. Incorporating the intensive longitudinal measurement of these theoretical constructs is critical to improving the fit of control system model of physical activity and for advancing behavioral theory.

Specifically, we focus on the structure, functionality, and development process of MyDay, which is an IoT-based, multi-faceted self-management problem solving tool for pediatric T1D patients. By leveraging IoT technologies, MyDay can connect with various devices to integrate traditionally paper-documented physiological data (e.g., blood glucose values) in real-time with psychosocial and contextual data, such as mood, stress, and social activities. By integrating relevant–but heterogeneous–data sources, MyDay can create personalized feedback for self-awareness of factors associated with diabetes self-management patterns and promote data sharing and problem solving. Iterative user-centered design cycles were used throughout the development of MyDay to document and/or troubleshoot feasibility and technical stability, optimize feedback for effective health communication through data visualization, identify barriers to app use, optimize assessment, and evaluate capability of the app as a problem solving tool. Each iterative design round identified technical and design issues that were addressed in subsequent rounds by incorporating user input and expertise.

Digital health interventions such as mHealth, Telemedicine, e-health and other health related applications, have demonstrated the potential for improving healthcare servicing in developing countries like South Africa. However, there are notable challenges or barriers to implementing digital heath interventions. There has not been enough research into understanding barriers into health technology solutions in South Africa. Aim: This review seeks to identify DHI and study core barriers to digital health solutions in South Africa. Methods: The systematic scoping review will search for primary peer reviewed literature and grey literature. Grey literature search will be limited to official reports on digital health interventions in South Africa. The study will primarily be guided by the PRISMA guidelines. Information sources for this review will include Pubmed, Google search engine, Web of science and EMBASE. The screening and data extraction process will follow using various themes developed by the author. Results: The study is expected to identify research gaps that can inform policy framework on DHI and provide a body of knowledge to improve the implementation of innovative solutions in the healthcare sector.","1949-0488","978-1-6654-8988-1","10.1109/SISY56759.2022.10036322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036322","mHealth;Telehealth;Digital Health Intervention;Digital Health;Digital Health Technology;e-Health;Barriers;South Africa","Heating systems;Systematics;Telemedicine;Search engines;Electronic healthcare;Internet;Intelligent systems","","","","29","IEEE","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, traditional visit-based therapy sessions are restrained by challenges, such as limited follow-up, insufficient data collection, low treatment adherence, and delayed intervention. In this paper, we present Instant Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (iACT), a system designed to enhance the quality of pediatric ACT. iACT utilizes text messaging technology, which is the most popular cell phone activity among adolescents, to conduct real-time psychotherapy interventions. The system is built on cloud computing technologies, which provides a convenient and cost-effective monitoring environment. To evaluate iACT, a trial with 60 adolescents with SCD is being conducted in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Georgia State University.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0216-7","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6609992","","Pain;Educational institutions;Diseases;Google;Psychology;Pediatrics","Acceptance and Commitment Therapy;Adolescent;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Cell Phone;Child;Humans;Psychotherapy;Telemedicine","12","","22","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, mobile health (mHealth) apps aimed at improving individuals' diet, physical activity, sleep and mental health, are emerging at an increasing pace. These modern digital health interventions are a promising solution to promote behaviour change and help people maintain better health while controlling rising healthcare expenditures. However, the real-life effects of mHealth apps are often overshadowed by high dropout rates, with the loss of participants during the intervention seeming to be the rule rather than the exception. We designed the mHealth4U model as a sample-based study of user requirement and design preferences to enable more targeted health and wellbeing self-management. This model is aimed at understanding how life-changing digital health interventions can be designed and what software design components might increase consumers' acceptance, adherence and continuous engagement. We put forward three hypotheses in terms of designing an mHealth app that is consumer-centred: consumers prefer (1) self-management mHealth apps that target multiple key health and wellbeing dimensions, (2) intelligent recommendations, and (3) behaviour change support delivered precisely where, when and how it is needed most. We design the mHealth4U model around the 3U cyber security design components (user, usage and usability) and validate the hypotheses through a randomised sampling test with 114 participants.

However, current measurement approaches which assess flow via self-report scales after task execution are limited due to obtrusiveness and a lack of real-time support. Hence, new measurement approaches must be created to overcome these limitations. In this article, we use cardiac features (heart rate variability; HRV) and a Random Forest classifier to distinguish high and low flow. Our results from a large-scale lab experiment with 158 participants and a field study with nine participants reveal, that with HRV features alone, flow-classifiers can be built with an accuracy of 68.5 percent (lab) and 70.6 percent (field). Our research contributes to the challenge of developing a less obtrusive, real-time measurement method of flow based on physiological features and to investigate flow from a physiological perspective. Our findings may serve as foundation for future work aiming to build physio-adaptive systems which can improve employee's performance. For instance, these systems could ensure that no notifications are forwarded to employees when they are ‘sensing’ flow.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2020.3045269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9296229","Flow;machine learning;heart rate variability (HRV);field study;lab experiment","Heart rate variability;Physiology;Task analysis;Information systems;Real-time systems;Particle measurements;Current measurement","","13","","87","IEEE","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For slowing the progression of renal failure, dietary protein restriction has been recommended for patients with CKD. However, receiving lower doses of this dietary intervention reduces its effectiveness and results in usage attrition and patient dropout. Therefore, dietary compliance has become a well-recognized challenge to the development of effective dietary protein restriction interventions. Using a food journaling app to log dietary intake has been shown to benefit people and health researchers. We hypothesized that using a food journaling app affects patients' dietary compliance (the first hypothesis), and indirectly improves health outcomes because of the increased compliance (the second hypothesis). We conducted a 12-week dietary protein restriction intervention. Twenty recruited participants were required to eat low-protein meals (0.6 g/kg ideal body weight/day), and self-report their dietary intake by using a food journaling app. Thirteen of 20 participants completed the dietary protein restriction intervention, and their health outcomes were measured according to changes in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, albumin, and glycated hemoglobin compared with those who dropped out. The empirical results support the first hypothesis and show that using the food journaling app can significantly increase the dietary compliance, but the results regarding the second hypothesis were not significant.","1530-1605","978-0-7695-5670-3","10.1109/HICSS.2016.421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7427605","dietary protein restriction interventions;chronic kidney disease;dietary compliance;food journaling app;health outcomes","Kidney;Proteins;Medical treatment;Smart phones;Diabetes;Cardiovascular diseases","","5","","45","IEEE","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finding reliable methods to forecast continuos engagement can aid in creating adaptive applications like web-based interventions, intelligent student tutoring, the creation of socially intelligent human-robots, etc. In this paper, we compare observational estimates from expert raters to vision-based learning, for estimating user engagement. The vision-based approach uses automated computation of Action Units combined with an RNN. Several data collection techniques have been explored in the past that capture different modalities for engagement from obtaining self-reports and gathering external observations via crowd-sourcing or even trained expert raters. Traditional machine learning approaches discard annotations from inconsistent raters, use rater averages or apply raterspecific weighting schemes. Such approaches often end up throwing away expensive annotations. We introduce a novel approach that exploits the inherent confusion and disagreement in raters annotations to build a scalable engagement estimation model that learns to appropriately weigh subjective behavioral cues. We show that actively modeling the uncertainty, either explicitly from expert raters or from automated estimation with AU, significantly improves prediction over prediction from just the average engagement ratings. Our approach performs significantly better or on par with experts in predicting engagement for a trauma-recovery application.","","978-1-5386-4886-5","10.1109/WACV.2018.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8354139","","Tools;Psychology;Task analysis;Training;Observers;Machine learning;Monitoring","","4","","44","IEEE","7 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are also challenges. We present FlowVis, an application which facilitates visual exploration of participants' experiences over the course of a digital health intervention. This application is based on the concept of participant trajectories, defined as paths that an individual might traverse during an intervention, characterized by key characteristics such as outcomes, usage, and qualitative data. FlowVis supports identification of subgroups of participants by similarities in their trajectories over time. We present a case study of the use of FlowVis in three parts. First, we perform exploratory analyses of the utility of different clustering methods for exploring digital health intervention data. Second, we present a flow-based visualization examining changes in participants' outcomes over the course of the intervention. Third, we compare subgroups of participants by their app usage behaviors. Though we illustrate usage of the application to explore data from one digital health intervention, the application can be applied to analyze other intervention datasets and potentially other types of performance data.

In this paper, we present a mobile health (mHealth) solution that leverages the Short Message Service (SMS) or text messaging feature of mobile devices to motivate behavior change among tobacco users. Our approach implements the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and a phase-based framework. We make contributions to improving previous mHealth intervention approaches by delivering personalized and evidence-based motivational SMS messages to participants. Our proposed solution implements machine learning algorithms that take the participant's demographic profile and previous smoking behavior into account.

However, these programs are expensive, resource-intensive and struggle with scalability and reachability, leading to limited take-up and short-term impact. Digital Health Intervention (DHI) programs incorporate the use of technology - mobile, web, wearables, virtual and augmented reality - to address these limitations while being more cost-effective. DHIs have shown major success in improving physical and mental health outcomes for the general public as well as reducing adverse outcomes or high-risk groups. However, it is still very challenging and expensive to design and run high quality mobile-based DHI programs, in part due to the lack of technical skills of researchers in this field. Our proposed mobile eHealth Learning and Intervention Platform (eHeLP) aims to address these challenges with a novel approach that allows health researchers to focus on their studies, and participants to have access to multiple health programs that meet their needs. The platform caters for identified stakeholders in the DHI field and encourages the development of a new health-tech industry. We present our vision eHeLP, why this idea is worth further research, risks we perceive, and next steps.","","978-1-4503-5712-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8543461","mHealth;Digitial Health Intervention;eHealth Marketplace;Health Analytics","Electronic healthcare;Data collection;Stakeholders;Ecosystems;Diseases;Australia;Industries","","","","23","","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pervasive usage of mobile technology by adolescents provides unprecedented data on their social interactions, communication patterns, and romantic relationship conflicts; as well as an opportunity to develop timely interventions to improve their wellbeing. This study investigates the potential of utilizing text messaging metadata from conversations with parental figures, friends, and other social connections for scalable early identification of moments of disagreement in romantic relationships in non-incarcerated, justice-involved youth. We utilize changepoint detection on text message metadata across various relationships, including the number of messages, length of messages, and response time, to identify changes in communication patterns across hours, days, and weeks, to estimate the day of a romantic disagreement. When comparing our predicted disagreement times to the current standard of intervention delivery, at random, we found statistically significant improvements in predicting disagreements with romantic partners.

Although asthma is intractable, its severity can be controlled through education and, more recently, the innovative use of mobile phone apps. In Indonesia, however, research on the impact of such apps on asthma patient's quality of life is limited. This non-experimental study sought to comprehend asthma patients' living conditions and determine if mobile phone app-based education could improve their quality of life. The survey was conducted between August and December 2022, with a total sample size of 40 participants based on the study's criteria. The Mini AQLQ questionnaire was used to collect data before and after the provision of education, and Wilcoxon hypothesis testing was used to analyze the data. 55% of participants initially had a poor quality of life, while 45% had an excellent quality of life. The high quality of life group increased to 62.5% after education, while the poor quality of life group decreased to 37.5%. The statistical analysis revealed that participant's average and median scores increased from the pre-test to the post-test. The Wilcoxon test yielded a p-value of 0.022, indicating a statistically significant difference between pre-test and post-test quality of life scores. Therefore, this study concludes that smartphone-based education can improve asthma patients' quality of life.","","979-8-3503-0533-3","10.1109/eSmarTA59349.2023.10293313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10293313","attitudes;knowledge;perception;telepharmacy;young pharmacist","Surveys;Statistical analysis;Education;Mobile handsets;Asthma;Testing;Diseases","","","","40","IEEE","31 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to investigate day-to-day fluctuations, experience sampling is a common assessment instrument. In recent years, experience sampling researchers have begun to provide their participants personalized feedback reports. Mostly, however, feedback only serves to motivate participation and is therefore provided at the end of a study. Accordingly, the potential benefits inherent in the personalized feedback on phenomena still being investigated are understudied. Taking into account individual variability, we developed personalized feedback on energy trajectories and associated behaviors. This feedback is automatically created from the self-reported data of each participant during daily diaries. We conducted a comprehensive randomized controlled study across four weeks with a sample of 136 employees from diverse occupational contexts to evaluate the effectiveness of this personalized feedback.

We propose a comprehensive theory-based framework of user features, the virtual individual (VI) model, to support the extensive personalization of digital well-being interventions. We introduce a prototype HRS (With-Me HRS) with knowledge-based filtering, which recommends behavior change objectives and activities from several lifestyle domains. With-Me HRS realizes a minimum set of important VI model features related to well-being, lifestyle, and behavioral intention. We report the preliminary validity and usefulness of the HRS, evaluated in a real-life health-coaching program with 50 participants. The recommendations were used in decision-making for half of the participants and were hidden for others. For 73% of the participants (85% with visible vs. 62% with hidden recommendations), at least one of the recommended activities was included into their coaching plans. The HRS reduced coaches’ perceived effort in identifying appropriate coaching tasks for the participants (effect size: Vargha-Delaney  $\hat {A}$  = 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.84) but not in identifying behavior change objectives.

In this paper, a novel JITAI mHealth app for GD called “Don't Go There” (DGT) is presented. It capitalizes on smartphones' global positioning software (GPS) or other zero-permission embedded sensors to recognizes a user's location. When the patient turns off the GPS capabilities, we infer the geolocation solving a probabilistic route matching problem. The purpose of DGT is to construct a geofence around a gambler's favored gambling establishment, to discourage participation. We hypothesize that the deployment of this app could lead to a reduction in gambling behavior and problems and improve psychological functioning.","2331-9860","978-1-7281-3893-0","10.1109/CCNC46108.2020.9045251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9045251","localization;GPS;geofence;mobile sensors;mHealth","Geology;Psychology;Probabilistic logic;Software;Sensors;Global Positioning System","","9","","14","IEEE","26 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Provisioning a web-based patient support system that helps in patient centered decision making and physician centered health monitoring would greatly help to reduce the treatment cost and improve the quality of life among patients. Extracting useful knowledge from very large web-based medical database and providing scientific decision-making is very difficult and yet critical. Applying Artificial Intelligence techniques for heterogeneous and large databases can deal with this problem.

They are also commonly used by Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) to assess suicidality. Specifically, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), a widely used suicide assessment questionnaire, helps MHPs determine the severity of suicide risk and offer an appropriate treatment. A major challenge in suicide treatment is the social stigma wherein the patient feels reluctance in discussing his/her conditions with an MHP, which leads to inaccurate assessment and treatment of patients. On the other hand, the same patient is comfortable freely discussing his/her mental health condition on social media due to the anonymity of platforms such as Reddit, and the ability to control what, when and how to share. The popular “SuicideWatch” subreddit has been widely used among individuals who experience suicidal thoughts, and provides significant cues for suicidality. The timeliness in sharing thoughts, the flexibility in describing feelings, and the interoperability in using medical terminologies make Reddit an important platform to be utilized as a complementary tool to the conventional healthcare system. As MHPs develop an implicit weighting scheme over the questionnaire (i.e., C-SSRS) to assess suicide risk severity, creating a relative weighting scheme for answers to be automatically generated to the questions in the questionnaire poses as a key challenge. In this interdisciplinary study, we position our approach towards a solution for an automated suicide risk-elicitation framework through a novel question answering mechanism. Our two-fold approach benefits from using: 1) semantic clustering, and 2) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models. We also generate a gold standard dataset of suicide posts with their risk levels. This work forms a basis for the next step of building conversational agents that elicit suicide-related natural conversation based on questions.","2325-6516","978-1-5386-6783-5","10.1109/ICOSC.2019.8665525","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8665525","Semantic Social Computing;Suicide Risk Assessment;Reddit;C-SSRS;The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition (DSM-5);Web-based Intervention;Semantic Machine Learning","Semantics;Social networking (online);Mental disorders;Knowledge discovery;Risk management;Task analysis;Medical services","","19","","19","IEEE","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following model development, a series of simulation scenarios illustrating the basic workings of the model are presented. The model's usefulness is demonstrated in the solution of two important practical problems: 1) semiphysical model estimation from data gathered in a physical activity intervention (the Mobile Interventions for Lifestyle Exercise and Eating at Stanford study) and 2) as a means for discerning the range of “ambitious but doable” daily step goals in a closed-loop behavioral intervention aimed at sedentary adults.

However, there are still many unresolved challenges to achieving viable operations for deep space habitats, mainly due to communication latencies. These latencies will limit the ability of mission control on Earth to command and control these space habitats and will also prevent mission control from assisting astronauts in real time. For example, astronauts occasionally require assistance while following procedures to perform maintenance tasks. Traditionally, mission controllers provide real-time support while monitoring astronauts during the execution of these maintenance tasks in low Earth orbit habitats (e.g., International Space Station). To mitigate the loss of this type of real-time support for deep space habitats, the use of Autonomous systems powered by artificial intelligence (AI) methods has been proposed. To develop these autonomous systems, we first need to understand the current state of the art for human task support in low earth orbit. To improve our understanding, we designed and conducted a survey study with ten former astronauts who performed space habitat maintenance tasks to identify and quantify feedback options (or suggestions) to be given during task execution. Although assistance from mission control is far more complex than just simple status feedback, simplifying assistance as a limited set of feedback options may make the implementation of human-AI teams easier. In this paper, we present the design process and results of the survey study regarding the preferred feedback options as a means of assistance for maintenance tasks in space habitats.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521038","","Surveys;Autonomous systems;Space technology;Habitats;Buildings;Low earth orbit satellites;Real-time systems","","","","11","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We tested one such method that focuses on using behavior change techniques for the design phase, and tested OpenEHR and BPMN2 as the basis for the ICT platform to support the deployment phase.","","978-1-4673-7701-0","10.1109/WiMOB.2015.7347983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347983","eCare;interoperability;interventions;behavior change interventions;OpenEHR;BPMN2","Medical services;Object oriented modeling;Data models;Interoperability;Standards;Psychology;Business","","","","20","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Barriers to treatment include limited access to trained professionals and high financial cost. eHealth applications are one alternative to treatment outside of a traditional clinical setting. Patients can readily access eHealth interventions on their own time via devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones. Despite the scalability and accessibility of eHealth applications, their benefits are overshadowed by high attrition rates. MindTrails (MT), an existing eHealth platform, uses Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) to treat anxiety through online interventions designed to change negative thinking patterns. The MindTrails program has the potential to treat a large population of anxious individuals. The objective of this work is to identify, analyze, and implement strategies to increase user engagement with MindTrails by exploring the integration of gamification/engagement strategies into the program. Our design for increasing engagement focuses on the Doherty Web Strategies, incorporating interactive, personal, supportive, and social elements. Using this new design, users will be able to set personalized goals that are clear, actionable, and reasonably challenging. To meet our objective, we developed high fidelity wireframes and prototypes, with the intent of utilizing user studies to evaluate the efficacy in MindTrails. Results of user tests are hypothesized to show the effectiveness of a personalized gamification feature in increasing user engagement while simultaneously reducing attrition. The improved design will be included in the next launch of the MindTrails program and demonstrates progress toward increasing the effectiveness of CBM treatment in eHealth applications.","","978-1-7281-0998-5","10.1109/SIEDS.2019.8735645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735645","eHealth;gamification;mental health;user engagement;user experience design","Prototypes;Electronic healthcare;Sociology;Statistics;Avatars;Diseases","","6","","14","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions can significantly reduce stress, in both face to face and digital formats. However, adherence to digital interventions is typically low. Virtual humans may improve adherence through their increased humanlike-ness and rapport-building behaviors. This study aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in response to MBSR when delivered by a virtual human, a human teletherapist or a chatbot. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 108 stressed University students randomized to one of the three delivery methods. Participants attended one in-person session of an MBSR intervention using their allocated delivery method and were asked to complete online homework at least twice a week for the following four weeks. The primary outcome was perceived stress, with secondary outcomes of physiological stress indices over the session, mindfulness, homework adherence, and perceived empathy of the agent. Results showed significant reductions in stress and increases in mindfulness across all groups over time. Peripheral skin temperature significantly increased across all three groups, but only the teletherapy group had significantly increased electrodermal activity after the in-person session. There were no significant effects on heart rate or indices of heart rate variability. Homework adherence was significantly greater in the virtual human group compared to the teletherapy group, and homework engagement was lowest in the chatbot group. The teletherapist was rated significantly more empathetic than the other agents. Overall, these results support the use of all three digital interventions for delivering MBSR. Virtual humans may have the advantage of increasing adherence to homework mindfulness sessions in student populations, but more work is needed to increase perceived empathy and to replicate these results in other populations.","","979-8-3503-2745-8","10.1109/ACIIW59127.2023.10388195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388195","Mindfulness;Stress;Virtual humans","Sociology;Psychology;Human factors;Chatbots;Skin;Physiology;Statistics","","1","","29","IEEE","16 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A predictive model for optimizing acceptance and use of mHealth interventions in low-resource settings: A case of Mamacare prototype","S.

Unfortunately, numerous challenges emanating from poverty, inadequate resources, illiteracy and cultural barriers contribute to poor health and high mortality rate in low-resource settings. To address these challenges, there are numerous mHealth interventions seeking to exploit opportunities provided by over 90% mobile penetration in developing countries. However, research shows that most of the interventions have failed to justify their value proposition to motivate integration into the conventional healthcare systems. This poor up-take requires a holistic approach in order to align mHealth solutions to consumer needs in the intended context of use. In this paper, we present a conceptual model named TIPFit that forms the basis for predicting acceptance and use of mHealth intervention at the design stage. To measure the predictive power of the model, we conducted repeated measures experiment using a cohort of 79 randomly selected subjects. During design of mHealth intervention named Mamacare, we operationalized TIPFit model into blueprints used for prototyping Mamacare; and indicators for data collection during the experiment. To analyze the pre-intervention dataset, we used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) that predicted 66.9% acceptance and 60.7% intended use. To evaluate the predictive power of the model, the cohort was recruited into Mamacare intervention that involved sending targeted SMS alerts as well as receiving real-time data on vital signs such as blood pressure. Results from datasets obtained after exposing the subjects to the intervention demonstrated 60.2% acceptance and 47.6% actual use. Although there was significant difference between our prediction and actual outcome, the study demonstrates that use of TIPFit model at the design stage is crucial to predicting fit and utilization of mHealth solutions in low-resource settings. Furthermore, the study shows that the proposed model can be tailored into a tool for evaluating intervention's progress towards attainment of desired health outcome.","2153-0033","978-1-5386-2775-4","10.1109/AFRCON.2017.8095535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8095535","Behaviour science;design science;mHealth;partial least squares;post-deployment;predictive model;prototype;structural equation modelling;utilization","Predictive models;Mathematical model;Mobile handsets;Prototypes;Pediatrics;Medical services;Tools","","1","","26","IEEE","7 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, we present a mobile intervention, termed Smart Continuity of Care for Opioid Recovery (SCCORe). It is a personalized composite intervention that closely connects OUD recovery patients with healthcare professionals and other caregivers. It also addresses the educational, monitoring, treatment and support needs for success in recovery, with induced engagement as needed.

The wide adoption of mobile technologies amongst the youth, especially in developing countries, makes mobile health interventions appealing to the youth. Thus, self-healthcare monitoring applications could be widely adopted by the youth, if designed in a way that is appealing to them. It is in this context that this paper investigates factors that could influence the use of self-healthcare monitoring mobile applications by the South African youth. From a sample of 280 students conveniently sampled from an institution of higher learning in South Africa, findings reveal that factors that motivate the use of mobile self-healthcare applications include results demonstrability, performance expectancy factors, savings, social aspects, awareness, connectivity, accessibility, ease of use, privacy, user satisfaction and affordability.

An interesting and important question not addressed in prior work is if face-based models of engagement are generalizable and context-free, or do engagement models depend on context and task. This research shows that context-sensitive face-based engagement models are more accurate, at least in the space of web-based tools for trauma recovery. Estimating engagement is important as various psychological studies indicate that engagement is a key component to measure the effectiveness of treatment and can be predictive of behavioral outcomes in many applications. In this paper, we analyze user engagement in a trauma-recovery regime during two separate modules/tasks: relaxation and triggers. The dataset comprises of 8M+ frames from multiple videos collected from 110 subjects, with engagement data coming from 800+ subject self-reports. We build an engagement prediction model as sequence learning from facial Action Units (AUs) using Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs). Our experiments demonstrate that engagement prediction is contextual and depends significantly on the allocated task. Models trained to predict engagement on one task are only weak predictors for another and are much less accurate than context-specific models.

Traditional intervention approaches like “Digital Detox” or Cognitive Behavior Therapy are not practical or scalable enough. However, there are examples of digital solutions to tackle problematic smartphone use - but their impact has not been examined thoroughly yet. We developed a new approach by conceptualizing four versions of digital Usage Management Tools (UMTs), which give the user personalized recommendations based on different types of private data. To test whether smartphone users would accept these UMTs, we conducted an online survey with 192 participants. The general evaluation of our UMTs was positive but deteriorated significantly after the privacy disclosure.

It has been shown that the risk factors of dementia are a mixture of pathological, lifestyle and heritable factors, with some of those being provably modifiable. Early diagnosis of dementia and approaches to slow down its evolution are currently the most prominent management methodologies due to lack of a cure. For that reason, a plethora of home-based assistive technologies for dementia management do exist, with most of them focusing on the improvement of memory and thinking. The main objective of LETHE is prevention in the whole spectrum of cognitive decline in the elderly population at risk reaching from asymptomatic to subjective or mild cognitive impairment to prodromal Dementia. LETHE will provide a Big Data collection platform and analysis system, that will allow prevention, personalized risk detection and intervention on cognitive decline. Through the subsequent 2-year clinical trial, the LETHE system, as well as the respective knowledge gained will be evaluated and validated. The scope of the current paper is to introduce the LETHE study and its respective novel platform as a holistic approach to multidomain lifestyle intervention trial studies. The present work depicts the architectural perspective and extends beyond state-of-the-art guidelines and approaches to health management systems and cloud platform development.Clinical Relevance — Patient Management Systems as well as lifestyle management platforms have significant clinical relevance as they allow for remote and continuous monitoring of patients' health status.

A recent study indicates PF being a significant predictor of heart rate variability (HRV) and mediating relationship between HRV and pain interference. In recent years, HRV has been studied using non-linear dynamics approaches which better quantify the fractal behavior of the inter-beat interval time series. In this study, we propose the use of multi-scale HRV features for predicting PF. The new features are tested on a dataset collected from 200 hospital workers (nurses and staff) during their normal work shifts. We show that fusion of breathing signal features further improves the performance showing the complementarity of two feature sets. We achieve an overall improvement of 4.54% F1-score over benchmark HRV features. These results indicate the importance of non-linear features for PF measurement. An accurate measurement of PF can help in developing pain and distress intervention methods by unobtrusive measurement of physiological signals using wearable sensors in real life conditions.","","978-1-7281-3891-6","10.1109/ACIIW.2019.8925281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925281","pain;psychological flexibility;heart rate variability;SVM;wearable sensors","Heart rate variability;Feature extraction;Pain;Time series analysis;Psychology;Benchmark testing","","3","","39","Crown","8 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we show that time of the day and features from modalities such as screen usage, accelerometer, app usage, and location are indicative of eating and non-eating events. Then, we show that eating events can be inferred with an AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) of 0.65 using subject-independent machine learning models, which can be further improved up to 0.81 for subject-dependent and 0.81 for hybrid models using personalization techniques. Moreover, we show that users have different behavioral and contextual routines around eating episodes requiring specific feature groups to train fully personalized models. These findings are of potential value for future mobile food diary apps that are context-aware by enabling scalable sensing-based eating studies using only smartphones; detecting under-reported eating events, thus increasing data quality in self report-based studies; providing functionality to track food consumption and generate reminders for on- time collection of food diaries; and supporting mobile interventions towards healthy eating practices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3179702","European Commission’s Horizon 2020 Project “WeNet: The Internet of Us”(grant numbers:823783); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9786810","Smartphone sensing;mobile sensing;eating behavior;food diary;mobile health;automatic dietary monitoring;diet monitoring;eating event;eating episode;machine learning;personalization","Sensors;Behavioral sciences;Wearable computers;Machine learning;Training;Statistics;Sociology","","4","","78","CCBY","2 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, we take two modeling approaches to understand what features of physical activity, sleep, and user emotional wellbeing best predict changes in depressive symptoms. We find overlap in the features selected by our two modeling approaches, which implies the importance of certain features. Characteristics around sleep, such as change and irregularity of sleep duration, appear as meaningful predictors, as does personality. Our work corroborates prior results that sleep is strongly related to changes in depressive symptoms, but we show that even a very coarse measure has some predictive capability.","","978-1-5090-3090-3","10.1109/WH.2016.7764552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7764552","","Mood;Sensors;Smart phones;Accelerometers;Sociology;Statistics;Feature extraction","","14","","35","IEEE","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mobile devices in particular offer many advantages in regard to their deployment for the purposes of shaping care. Yet, these systems and their implications for practice are not predetermined but crafted, often in unforeseen ways, by design. Amidst growing knowledge of complex clinical contexts, human–computer interaction researchers have come to understand the need to approach design as participatory, iterative process grounded in research, and informed by the experiences of stakeholders broadly defined. In this article we build upon prior efforts to support care, by making the case for a recentering of the artefacts we perceive as “designed,” “designable,” and “design-worthy” in the creation and implementation of the digital health intervention. In doing so, we draw on the example of a mobile health technology platform to support mental healthcare through Danish primary care.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2022.3197330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9875372","","Electronic healthcare;Public healthcare;Human computer interaction;Oral communication;Heart;Mobile applications;Clinical diagnosis","","","","20","IEEE","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Although “supportive accountability” (the addition of human coaching to a digital intervention) may help reduce attrition, human support is not always well-suited for DMH interventions targeting anxiety or emotional difficulties (due to the inherent challenge of social interaction among individuals in these populations.) In response, a virtual conversational agent was designed after evaluating support needs with respect to embodiment/non-embodiment, free-text response/quick replies, and domain-free/domain-specific conversational properties. DARA's usability and comprehensiveness were evaluated among 12 subject-matter experts using a suite of quantitative and qualitative usability questions, including the PSSUQ Version 3. Usage data were also recorded from chatbot interactions. Results suggest that chatbots may be particularly appropriate for anxious users, although navigation and lack of depth in chatbot responses may pose concerns. We suggest that these concerns can be resolved by technical improvements and hybridization of the human-chatbot support system. We make future recommendations for the design and integration of the DARA chatbot and the use of chatbots in other DMH interventions targeting anxiety.","","978-1-6654-5111-6","10.1109/SIEDS55548.2022.9799419","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799419","","Navigation;Anxiety disorders;Sociology;Mental health;Chatbots;Usability;Statistics","","","","35","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

App-based lifestyle interventions have been utilized to promote physical activity in people with or at risk for chronic conditions. However, these mHealth tools have remained largely static and do not adapt to the changing behavior of the user. In a step toward designing adaptive interventions, we propose BeWell24Plus, a framework for monitoring activity and user engagement and developing computational models for outcome prediction and intervention design. In particular, we focus on devising algorithms that combine data about physical activity and engagement with the app to predict future physical activity performance. Knowing in advance how active a person is going to be in the next day can help with designing adaptive interventions that help individuals achieve their physical activity goals. Our technique combines the recent history of a person’s physical activity with app engagement metrics such as when, how often, and for how long the app was used to forecast the near future’s activity. We formulate the problem of multimodal activity forecasting and propose an LSTM-based realization of our proposed model architecture, which estimates physical activity outcomes in advance by examining the history of app usage and physical activity of the user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our forecasting approach using data collected with 58 prediabetic people in a 9-month user study. We show that our multimodal forecasting approach outperforms single-modality forecasting by 2.2% to 11.1% in mean-absolute-error.","2376-8894","978-1-6654-5925-9","10.1109/BSN56160.2022.9928521","National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9928521","machine learning;physical activity;wearables;time-series forecasting","Measurement;Body sensor networks;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;History","","","","9","IEEE","1 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Factors affecting students to drop include family, individual, community and school related factors were identified. Based from these factors, appropriate types of intervention programs were determined through focus group discussions with secondary school teachers and guidance counselors. A web-based intervention support program system was developed with the use of Fuzzy Logic-Based prescriptive analytics. First, the system predicts students at risk of dropping out through the identified factors as inputs. Second, based from the results of the prediction, the system's fuzzy inference mechanism determines both the intervention applicability and effectivity to provide suitable intervention prescription as the system's final output. Results show that students who are at risk of dropping out can be identified earlier with the correct inputs in the developed system and appropriate interventions vary from one student to another. Thus, making the study useful in addressing the issue with increasing school dropouts by prescribing suitable intervention programs.","","978-1-6654-1484-5","10.1109/CSPA52141.2021.9377304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377304","fuzzy logic;prescriptive analytics;interventions","Fuzzy logic;Education;Buildings","","","","18","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Toward this direction, this paper presents an integrated mHealth system that provides real-time personalized feedback to patients for assessing the proper medication use and educating them and helping them avoid common mistakes. The identification of proper inhaler use is based on conventional and data-driven feature extraction and classification methods employed for the identification of four events (inhaler actuation, inhalation, exhalation, and background noise). The proposed scheme reaches 98% classification accuracy significantly outperforming recent and relevant state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, intuitive feedback interfaces were implemented in the form of a virtual guidance agent integrated with the mobile application, which can help patients follow their action plan and assess their inhaler technique in a more engaging manner.

Dalziel","University of Western, Penrith, NSW","2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Education Media (ICEM)","26 May 2014","2013","","","1","6","The University of Western Sydney (UWS) draws on a diverse population of students, many of whom come from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. In a bid to improve digital access for students in an increasingly blended learning environment, UWS distributed over 11,000 iPads to first year students and academic staff at the start of 2013. The School of Medicine at UWS implemented several different strategies to see which would best foster student engagement and effective iPad use: (1) Student centred collaborative learning; (2) Student creation of digital content; (3) Interactive exercises during lectures, and (4) A student-centric approach to course administration As the start of the year coincides with the start of first semester in Australia, these initiatives were introduced as soon as the students commenced study in medicine. Action based research based on observation of students' behaviour and student surveys was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies. It is anticipated that these innovations offer cumulative benefits for student satisfaction beyond the advantage of each individual strategy. For example, providing regular updates of course information encourages students to retain their device at all times, which ensures widespread iPad availability for interactive exercises in lectures and small-group collaborative learning. This paper discusses the implementation of these strategies and early results from student feedback.","","978-1-4799-3216-0","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820201","Blended learning;iPad;collaborative learning;engagement;health intervention apps","Tablet computers;Educational institutions;Calendars;Portable computers;Conferences;Councils;Media","","2","","6","IEEE","26 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MEWS app, as a real-time clinical decision support (RT-CDS) application, does not require the use of an Electronic Health Record System to support its operation. Instead, it is able to receive patient vital sign measurements from any patient physiological monitoring device connected to OpenICE, irrespective of the device manufacturer. Based on the received vital signs, MEWS calculates an overall score indicating the monitored patient's current status and is intended to direct clinicians to patients showing signs of deteriorating conditions and hence needing immediate intervention. The implementation and deployment of the MEWS app on OpenICE presents a preliminary step to understand the challenge of establishing (data) interface protocols to enable medical device interoperability generally, and for RT-CDS applications in particular, and to establish requirements for bridging the gap of current industrial standardization activities in addressing this challenge.","","978-1-7281-4687-4","10.1109/CHASE48038.2019.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8908656","Interoperable-medical-system;data-interface;real-time-clinical-decision","Biomedical monitoring;Medical devices;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Medical services;Interoperability","","1","","18","IEEE","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461555","FAU Emerging Fields Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7169494","Wearable technologies;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;knowledge discovery;patients;Internet of things (IoT);knowledge discovery;parkinson's disease (PD);patients;wearable technologies","Parkinson's disease;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of things;Wearable sensors","Cell Phone;Humans;Internet;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine","246","","112","IEEE","28 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, patients suffering from medical disorders/conditions, such as dementia, epilepsy, stroke, and cardiac arrest often find themselves in situations requiring immediate intervention from medical personnel who need prompt access to personal medical records. Given the urgency of such situations, access to the required patient's information in a medical database can be tedious and may deplete critical, life-saving, time; thus, a more adaptable, interoperable, and efficient means of obtaining personal medical information becomes a necessity. As such, this study presents the design and development of a SIM card-based personal medical record bracelet/pendant system, tagged with a `Medirec' logo for ease of member recognition, and which is readable on Nokia Symbian mobile phones. The system consists of either a silicon-gel wristband or an army-style pendant that houses the SIM-card, encoded with the individual's medical record that is then displayed on the phone by a custom-developed `Medirec' software application. The developed system is cost-effective, un-encumbering, and ubiquitous. It also takes into account the holder's right to privacy inherent in the procedural manner in which the information is handled. At the same time, the system is considered to be interoperable with existing database systems.","1948-2922","978-1-4244-9352-4","10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098724","Personal Health Systems;Personal Health Records;Personalized Health;Mobile Health;Electronic Health Records","USA Councils;Mobile handsets;Medical services;Conferences;Medical diagnostic imaging;History","","1","","18","IEEE","12 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We evaluated two feedback styles, i.e., cooperative and directive, in the TNO Experience lab, with older and younger adults playing the role of patient and technical specialist, respectively, in “failure scenarios”. Results show that most effective troubleshooting occurs with teams consisting of a older patient receiving cooperative feedback and a younger technical specialist receiving directive feedback.

Therefore, this study designed a computerized mind therapy module for youth aged 19 to 24 years to self-manage mild depression. The methodology comprised of three phases, namely document analysis, brainstorming, and storyboard sketching to design the requirements of a computerized therapy module that considers the needs of youth users. The first phase involved document analysis of written and electronic materials from previous studies. The second phase is a brainstorming session on the content of the application module conducted with seven experts consisting of mental health professionals, and multimedia experts with more than 10 years of experience. And the third phase involves developing the computerized therapy module, and sketching storyboards for low-fidelity prototype development. The results of the study consist of a computerized therapy module and a low-fidelity prototype interface that was developed based on the youth's needs.

The participants were 90 distance students registered in two courses of an English Integrated Skills class, which is included in the English Major offered by Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja. The students belonged to an A2 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The research was conducted through a mixed approach in which a diagnostic questionnaire was first administered to determine the participants' learning needs. Subsequently, a pedagogical intervention was carried out by two instructors for a 14-week period. This process included academic monitoring and personalized feedback. At this intervention, 30 matching audiogames were carefully designed and used in both courses. Once this stage finished, a students' perceptions questionnaire was applied and an interview was conducted to teachers who were in charge of using these games as a supplementary resource in their classes. The results demonstrated that gamification through audiogames is highly effective since they have the potential to strengthen both, productive and receptive English as a Foreign Language (EFL) skills, especially the listening ability. In addition, the use of audiogames improves students' learning experience, encourages autonomous learning, and helps them to be actively involved in academic activities, thus improving their attention, participation and reflection.","","978-1-7281-9268-0","10.1109/LACLO50806.2020.9381160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381160","Gamification;audiogames;higher education;English language","Education;Europe;Games;Tools;Reflection;Interviews;Monitoring","","1","","0","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, teenagers are more vulnerable for abuse and health problems in particularly for teenage pregnancy. To minimize this issue, Health Organizations have started conducting workshops with the intention of empowering teenagers with knowledge, attitude and safety skills required to prevent pregnancy. However, teenagers seem reluctant to show their interest for studying about sexuality and talk about their issues openly. Therefore, health organizations emphasize the importance of identifying an innovative and personalized strategy to develop psychosocial competencies in teenagers. Since information and communication technology has proven to bring benefits for education through online learning technologies, the present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an online educational intervention to develop psychosocial competencies required to prevent teenage pregnancy. Data were gathered through interviews, questionnaires and focused group interviews from a group of female adolescents. The findings imply that psychosocial competencies can be improved better through an online intervention than a classroom-based intervention and it suggested that delivering lessons using videos, games and discussions might probably be well accepted by the adolescents. According to the findings, several paper prototypes were developed and evaluated. Based on the results of the prototype evaluation, an online intervention was developed. The final product was evaluated in a true experiment. The results of the study could be interpreted as the online intervention was successful in achieving psychosocial competencies among adolescents. Further the findings of the present study signified that the psychosocial competencies can be developed among the teenagers using videos, games and discussions as instructional aids or approaches.","2472-7598","978-1-5386-7352-2","10.1109/ICTER.2018.8615582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8615582","Design guidelines;Gaming principles;Instructional design;Psychosocial competency;Teenage pregnancy","Games;Pregnancy;Organizations;Sociology;Statistics;Education;Interviews","","","","28","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transformer’s self-attention weights, on the other hand, can capture rich associations between each time point and the entire sequence. Because of the rarity of anomalies, it is difficult for anomalous points to establish associations with the entire sequence, but they tend to have close associations with neighboring regions.This difference can be leveraged to differentiate anomalies.By improving the self-attention module of the original Transformer model, we construct a Transformer model with dual-path modeling capability. Using the idea of anomaly detection based on association modeling, we perform anomaly detection on bridge data. The experimental results show that the precision reaches 91.5%. This detection method is effective in distinguishing anomalies.This paper takes the bridge of urban rail transportation in Wuhan as the background, with a large amount of data and a high demand for real-time support for the detection of numerous sensor data. After adopting the sparse attention mechanism, the time cost decreased by 10.7% while the precision did not decrease by about 1%.

These environments usually follow the `one size fits all' approach and provide students with the same feedback. Several personalized feedback frameworks have been proposed which adapt the different types of feedback based on the student characteristics and/or the assessment question characteristics. The frameworks are intradisciplinary, neglect the characteristics of the assessment question, and either hard-code or auto-generate the types of feedback from a restricted set of solutions created by a domain expert. This paper contributes to research carried out on personalized feedback frameworks by proposing a generic novel system which is called the Ontology-based Personalized Feedback Generator (OntoPeFeGe). OntoPeFeGe addressed the aforementioned drawbacks using an ontology-a knowledge representation of the educational domain. It integrated several generation strategies and templates to traverse the ontology and auto-generate the questions and feedback. The questions have different characteristics, in particular, aiming to assess students at different levels in Bloom's taxonomy. Each question is associated with different types of feedback that range from verifying student's answers to giving the student more details related to the answer. The feedback auto-generated in OntoPeFeGe is personalized using a rule-based algorithm which takes into account the student characteristics and the assessment question characteristics. The personalized feedback in OntoPeFeGe was quantitatively evaluated on 88 undergraduate students. The results revealed that the personalized feedback significantly improved the performance of students with low background knowledge. In addition, the feedback was evaluated qualitatively using questionnaires provided to teachers and students. The results showed that teachers and students were satisfied with the feedback.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8379418","Ontology;formative feedback;Bloom’s taxonomy;question generation;feedback generation;personalized","Generators;Ontologies;Taxonomy;Knowledge based systems;Computer science;Feeds;Back","","23","","59","OAPA","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design process relies on a behavioral dynamical model based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), with a controller formulation based on hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) being used to implement the decision scheme. The discrete and logical features of HMPC coincide naturally with the categorical nature of the intervention components and the logical decisions that are particular to an intervention for physical activity. The intervention incorporates an online controller reconfiguration mode that applies changes in the penalty weights to accomplish the transition between the behavioral initiation and maintenance training stages.

A digital medicine solution which provides an accessible, real-time mobile health (mHealth) biofeedback intervention for panic attacks may address this problem. Critical to this approach are methods for capturing physiological arousal during an attack. Herein, we validate an algorithm for capturing physiological arousal using smartphone video of the fingertip. Results demonstrate that the algorithm is able to estimate heart rates that are highly correlated with ECG-derived values (r > 0.99), effectively reject low-quality data often captured outside of controlled laboratory environments (AUC > 0.90), and resolve the physiological arousal experienced during a panic attack. Moreover, patient reported measures indicate that this measurement modality is feasible during panic attacks, and the act of taking the measurement may stop the attack.

This stems from the fact that in most cases, pregnant learners do not receive adequate support. Hence, learners end up hiding their pregnancies or terminating their pregnancies. This poses a serious health-related concern because if pregnancies are not nurtured at an early stage, the results therefore could be complications that may endanger the life of the pregnant learner and the unborn baby. In addition, if pregnant learners are not given adequate care, they end up dropping from school and hence jeopardizing their future careers. In South Africa, there are many interventions that cater for maternal health. However, the uptake of such interventions among secondary school learners is very minimal due to the stigma attached to falling pregnant out of the wedlock and at a very young age. On the other hand, mobile phones penetration among the youth in South Africa is high. This presents an opportunity for designing mHealth interventions targeting pregnant learners. This paper presents a preliminary design of an mHealth intervention that could help teenagers get accurate information pertaining to pregnancy-related issues and get help when needed. In addition, the intervention involves major stakeholders that should be involved in addressing teenage pregnancy issues. It is believed that this proposed mHealth intervention will be more efficient compared to other interventions provided that buy-in from all the identified stakeholders is secured.","2377-6919","978-1-5386-5566-5","10.1109/GHTC.2018.8601877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8601877","pregnancy;teenagers;secondary school;South Africa","Pregnancy;Pediatrics;Engineering profession;Conferences;Education;Collaboration;Africa","","1","","29","IEEE","6 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Proposed assessment design is a skills-oriented game-based assessment approach. Learners can determine their own goals and create individualized multimodal artefacts; receive cognitive challenge through cognitively complex tasks structured in gamified non-linear learning paths; while reflecting on personal growth through personalized feedback derived from learning analytics. This pilot research looked to: (i) establish validity of all key elements within the assessment design through structural equation modelling, and (ii) identify if application of assessment design leads to improved learner satisfaction based on differences-in-differences estimation using hierarchical linear regression. Results validated all key elements of GHMA assessment model, as beneficial factors tied to positive learner satisfaction on assessment delivery.

However, SA often develops and changes rapidly, especially during highly-demanding operational tasks such as piloting aircraft or responding to emergencies. In order to enable just-in-time interventions, systems must have access to the current state of operator SA. Gold-standard objective measures of situation awareness require freeze-probes, a metric that cannot be implemented in operational settings. In order to access this dynamic cognitive state, this work seeks to develop unobtrusive and real-time methods for estimating SA. To do so, this study collected psychophysiological, neurophysiological, behavioral, and performance data while subjects complete the MATB-II, a complex task-battery designed to imitate high-workload scenarios. The task was frozen at regular intervals and subjects completed objective SA assessments and workload questionnaires. Between these freeze-probes, task difficulty and priority were manipulated in order to induce a variety of SA outcomes. Data streams including fNIRS, EEG, ECG, eye-tracking, heart rate, EDA, respiration, and in-task behavioral measures were collected. In correlational analysis, features such as heart rate and skin conductance response were found to be potentially useful data streams for estimating situation awareness. In future work, these and other data streams will be incorporated into models to predict scores on objective freeze-probe assessments in real-time.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-9032-0","10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115788","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115788","","Heart rate;Measurement;Correlation;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Real-time systems;Physiology","","1","","14","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we design a persuasive mobile app, called SleepFit, targeted at young adults with the aim of improving their sleep habits or behaviours which in turn would improve their mental health and wellbeing. To achieve this, we employ the user-centered design approach in five stages. First, we elicit user preferences by conducting two concurrent focus group (FG) sessions to understand participants' current sleep habits, contributing factors, and how a persuasive mobile app (such as SleepFit) can help to improve their situation. Second, we design low-fidelity prototypes (LFP) illustrating various features of SleepFit based on our findings from the FG sessions after data analysis. Third, we conduct a user study to assess perceived persuasiveness of the features illustrated by the LFP. Our findings show that users perceived 7 features (Sleep Analysis, News Feed, Smart Alarm, Chat, Sleep Music, Notification, and Sleep Diary) as significantly persuasive for improving their sleep habits. Fourth, we design high-fidelity prototypes which reflect only the features that are perceived as significantly persuasive, based on the results of the LFP evaluation. Finally, we conduct a usability evaluation of the high-fidelity prototypes (HFP) and then refine the HFP based on qualitative feedback after thematic analysis.","2573-3060","978-1-6654-2649-7","10.1109/SEGAH52098.2021.9551907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551907","sleep disorder;mental health;persuasive technology;persuasive strategies;mobile app;behaviour change;user-centered design;thematic analysis;wellbeing","User centered design;Refining;Prototypes;Mental health;User experience;Mobile applications;Serious games","","1","","35","IEEE","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for the last two decades, trials were carried out to improve compliance and understand factors impacting compliance, but there were not enough conclusive results. With the advent of big data analytic and real-time monitoring, new opportunities open up to tackle this compliance issue.

A variety of personalized wellness applications support self-quantification based recommendations to provide wellness status for achieving personalized targets. However, these applications are unable to promote the induction of new healthy habits and thus are not too much effective for long term as users tend to loose their interest. Thus, we have proposed a methodology for User-Centric Adaptive Intervention based on behavior change theory for maintaining end-users’ interest. The methodology consists of four steps: (1) quantification of behavior based on contributing factors governed by expert-driven rules; (2) behavior-context based mapping for the identification of behavior status of the user; (3) selection of appropriate way of intervention to get fruitful outcomes; and finally (4) feedback based evaluation on the basis of recorded activities and questionnaires for satisfaction. A comprehensive healthy behavior index-based quantification supports the machine learning-based prediction model for behavior-context mapping. Furthermore, the evaluation is performed through implicit and explicit feedback analysis along with the accuracy of the behavior-context prediction model through multiple scenarios to cover comprehensive situations. The ensemble classifier suggests the accuracy of 98.02% for the behavior-context prediction model, which is higher than the other classifiers. The gain in behavior change is drawn from implicit feedback, which depicts that behavior context-based methods have improved the adaptation in behavior at a steady pace for the long term. The explicit feedback from 99 end-users of wellness application based on the proposed methodology obtained Good and Desired status for widely used System Usability Score and AttrakDiff tools respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3026688","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC); Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2017-0-01629); Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant; Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2017-0-00655); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Grant Information Technology Research Center; Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2020-0-01489,NRF-2016K1A3A7A03951968,NRF-2019R1A2C2090504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205803","User behavior;behavior-context;lifestyle;lifelog monitoring;self-quantification;healthy behavior index;adaptive interventions","Diseases;Fats;Predictive models;Monitoring;Alcoholic beverages","","","","90","CCBY","25 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This integration of technology in the education sector has given rise to the edtech industry which is transforming as newer technologies are introduced. Training delivered to the learners, along with the assessment of the learners, are the fundamental components of the education sector. However, current methods of delivering training and assessing learners face numerous challenges, including skill shortage due to technology advancements, high costs, conducting complex training in high- risk environments. Similarly, assessment methods struggle with inflexible assessment strategies and limited personalized feedback to learners. Addressing these challenges in training and assessment, this study proposes a smart training and assessment framework (STAF) which leverages the benefits of augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) based large language models (LLMs) which stand out as a monumental leap in reshaping the training and assessment sector. As part of this study, an AR based training module was created and delivered to students. A survey was conducted of these students to gain insights about the adaptability of AR based trainings and potential to improve these trainings. It is concluded that along with AR in education, AI and LLMs with prompt engineering strategies should be integrated in the education domain for better interactivity and enhanced student performance. Currently, limited research is conducted on integration of LLMs in AR environments for the education sector and this paper provides an in-depth exploration of the immense potential of the applications of LLMs within the realm of training and assessment for improved learner performance.","","979-8-3503-3852-2","10.1109/IEEECONF58110.2023.10520594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10520594","edtech;large language models;AR training;smart assessment;prompt engineering","Training;Surveys;Industries;Visualization;Costs;Virtual assistants;Natural languages","","","","16","IEEE","14 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We express the mathematical model as a function of activity, habit, and nutrition with the first order law of thermodynamics, basal metabolic rate (BMR), total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), and body-mass-index (BMI) to establish a link between health behavior and weight change. We have used revised Harris-Benedict formulas (HB) for BMR and TDEE calculations. The proposed model showed a strong relationship between health behavior and weight change. The adoption of BMR and TDEE measures following the revised HB formula has outperformed the classical Wishnofsky’s rule (3500 kcal. ≈ 1 lb. or 7700 kcal ≈ 1 Kg.), and the models proposed by Toumasis et al., Azzeh et al., and Mickens et al. with an average standard deviation (σ) of ±2.26, ±2.67, ±2.432, and ±2.29 respectively. This study helped us to understand the impact of healthy behavior on weight change with a mathematical model and its importance in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.","","978-1-6654-8016-1","10.1109/HealthCom54947.2022.9982785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982785","Model;Obesity;Healthy Behavior;Weight loss;Harris-Benedict Formula;Optimization","Weight measurement;Obesity;Thermodynamics;Predictive models;Mathematical models;Data models;Behavioral sciences","","","","47","IEEE","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To do so, we applied a survey with assignments and their respective source codes answered by students in previous terms. Teachers and students analyze those source codes and gave suggestions to improve them qualitatively and, we found that most students identified code quality aspects with a similarity equal to or greater than 50% in comparison to teachers' and that similarity increases as students progress in the course. We found that students are particularly good at finding and giving feedback on complexity issues.

While these tools may have positive effects, they require use of students’ personal data, and more research into student preferences regarding these tools is needed. In this study, we investigated how learning strategies and study engagement are related to students’ willingness to share data with learning analytics (LA) applications and whether these factors predict students’ opt-in for LA-based formative feedback. Students (N = 158) on a self-paced online course set their personal completion goals for the course and chose to opt in for or opt out of personalized feedback based on their progress toward their goal. We collected self-reported measures regarding learning strategies, study engagement, and willingness to share data for learning analytics through a survey (N = 73). Using a regularized partial correlation network, we found that although willingness to share data was weakly connected to different aspects of learning strategies and study engagement, students with lower self-efficacy were more hesitant to share data about their performance. Furthermore, we could not sufficiently predict students’ opt-in decisions based on their learning strategies, study engagement, or willingness to share data using logistic regression. Our findings underline the privacy paradox in online privacy behavior: theoretical unwillingness to share personal data does not necessarily lead to opting out of interventions that require the disclosure of personal data.

However, achieving adoption and scaling of digital tools in healthcare remains a challenging goal globally. This challenge is compounded by an inconsistent and fragmented approach to adoption and scaling, as well as a limited reliance on theoretical tools throughout a digital health intervention's lifecycle phases. This article argues that adoption and scaling requirements should be prominently integrated into each phase of traditional healthcare system development and project management processes to facilitate these systems' widespread adoption and use. Addressing this necessitates the operationalization of multiple theoretical tools across a digital health intervention's lifecycle. To tackle the identified weakness of limited reliance on theoretical tools, we conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis, culminating in a reusable framework for theory operationalization. To illustrate how the above framework can be applied in practice, we provide and discuss a use case scenario, involving a hypothetical design, development, and implementation of a remote patient management application. This work expands existing literature on technology implementation in healthcare by introducing a framework that assists practitioners to connect theoretical concepts to traditional system development and project management activities and phases.","1937-4178","","10.1109/EMR.2024.3412795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555885","Adoption;lifecycle;project;scaling;theory","Medical services;Project management;Reviews;Planning;Systematics;Electronic healthcare;Data mining","","","","","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The higher education sector is searching for new creative ways to provide the information online because of the switch from face-to-face to online synchronous course delivery. Students are also becoming accustomed to studying online, and research has shown that synchronous online learning has a variety of effects on student engagement. For instance, according to statistics from the National Survey of Student Engagement, students are less likely to participate in collaborative learning, studentfaculty interactions, and conversations when learning online if they use quantitative reasoning during face-to-face instruction. Additionally, studies suggest that because they depend on their devices to take online classes, students feel more alienated from their lecturers. This has been linked to a drop in contacts with peers and teachers as a result. By using a cutting-edge deep learning model to predict learner engagement behaviour in a synchronous teaching environment, our research intends to improve online engagement. The model with a clever trigger will encourage the disengaged pupils to communicate with the teachers online. Smart triggers will be built around factors that have been found, focusing on disengaged students to engage them in real-time with automatic, personalized feedback.","2325-9418","978-1-6654-7350-7","10.1109/INDICON56171.2022.10040191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040191","Deep learning model;online synchronous learning;Learner engagement;Personalized feedback;Interaction Quality (IoQ) factors","Deep learning;Learning management systems;Pandemics;Navigation;Education;Switches;Oral communication","","","","22","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During this unprecedented event of the century, people's health emerged as the most vulnerable and affected area either directly or indirectly by the coronavirus and its new variants. Disrupting almost all spheres of life, patients' health and care systems required timely support from healthcare professionals to provide the needed medical advice on one hand and a prescriptive mechanism to avoid another impending casualty. Similarly, a proactive approach became desirable from the health ministry, pharmaceutical firms, medical insurance companies, and other stakeholders in fine-tuning their offerings to the patients as per the recommender systems. The devices to measure the vitals of a person, became more efficient and ergonomically sound with the advent of wearable gadgets. These devices monitored the physical activities of the user and transferred the vital signals wirelessly to any base computing device and cloud-based repositories. This mechanism, however, was reported to fail in addressing the issues with non-communicating or stand-alone devices that were used by the masses in developing countries including India. If the real-time data could be used from these devices, the healthcare diagnosis and analysis of a patient's medical condition could have taken a progressive dimension with the addition of missing data points. This research thus aims to fill the information gap and proposes a transforming approach towards existing non-communicating devices used to measure the vitals like blood pressure, oxygen level, blood sugar, etc. The proposed MIST-based Cyber-Physical System shall create extensive scalability towards the retrieval of the vital details from the devices which were otherwise captured offline previously and were unused at multiple critical points of healthcare processes.","2575-7288","978-1-6654-0816-5","10.1109/ICACCS54159.2022.9785355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785355","MIST;Cyber-Physical Systems;Body Area Network;Healthcare Informatics;Recommender Systems","COVID-19;Pandemics;Medical services;Cyber-physical systems;Stakeholders;Biomedical monitoring;Statistics","","1","","20","IEEE","7 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Background: Tracking interactions on collaborative learning environments (CLEs) with an increasing number of collaborative tools, offering real-time support for students, is one of the most intense and exhaustive challenges online teachers face. In this work context, social presence indicates a level of awareness of the other in the CLE, and it is necessary to improve and promote online social interactions. Research Questions: Aiming to answer the research question if the support of the teaching presence through Amadeus-SIMM helps to promote the learners’ social presence in a distance learning course, an experiment was conducted through a Python Programming distance course with Computer Science and Electrical Engineering learners. Methodology: The research methods adopted were a survey and the reports generated by Amadeus-SIMM. The statistical models used were the difference between means calculated in two moments on the same sample and the chi-square test with two criteria. Findings: The conclusion is that the significant differences in six of the eight survey-independent questions related to the dependent question indicate an increase in learners’ perception of social presence. The statistical analysis verified that the difference between the sample means in the two measurements of social behavior visibility, engagement, information intermediation, and prestige is statistically significant to confirm that Amadeus-SIMM supports teachers in promoting learners’ social presence.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2022.3154935","CAPES—Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education, Brazil; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733016","Amadeus-SIMM;collaborative learning environment (CLE);social presence;teaching presence","Monitoring;Education;Social networking (online);Collaborative work;Collaborative tools;Blogs;Real-time systems","","3","","26","IEEE","11 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present the evaluation results of the impact that clinically diagnosed osteoarthritis of the knee at early stages has on insole pressure sensors while walking at normal speeds focusing on the effects caused at points, where knee forces tend to peak for normal users. From the different parts of the foot affected at high knee force moments, the forefoot pressure distribution and the heel to forefoot weight reallocation strategies have shown to provide better correlations with the user's perceived pain in the knee for OA users with mild knee pain. This paper shows how the time differences and variabilities from two sensors located in the metatarsal zone while walking provide a simple mechanism to detect different strategies used by users suffering OA of the knee from control users with no knee pain. The weight dynamic reallocation at the midfoot, when moving forward from heel to forefoot, has also shown to positively correlate with the perceived knee pain. The major asymmetries between pressure patterns in both feet while walking at normal speeds are also captured. Based on the described features, automatic evaluation self-management rehabilitation tools could be implemented to continuously monitor and provide personalized feedback for OA patients with mild knee pain to facilitate user adherence to individualized OA rehabilitation.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2017.2696303","HERMES-SMART DRIVER(grant numbers:TIN2013-46801-C4-2-R (MINECO)); Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI); ANALYTICS USING SENSOR DATA FOR FLATCITY Project through the AEI(grant numbers:TIN2016-77158-C4-1-R (MINECO/ERDF, EU)); European Regional Development Fund; Ministerio de Educación Cultura y Deporte(grant numbers:PRX15/00036); sabbatical leave by the Carlos III of Madrid University; Yorkshire and Humber; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906527","Insole pressure sensors;mild knee pain;osteoarthritis;machine learning;classification","Knee;Pain;Pressure sensors;Legged locomotion;Foot;Correlation","","18","","36","IEEE","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often manifests itself in terms of hand-washing compulsions. Detecting these compulsions can potentially improve the effectiveness of treatments. Therapists can offer additional just-in-time mobile interventions, improved momentary assessment, and interactive exposure and reaction prevention (ERP) training. This, however, requires reliable and ambulatory detection of obsessive hand-washing. We present a novel technique which enables hand-washing detection by means of a wrist-worn, capacitive sensing device. It relies on the effect that touching running tap water yields a strong change in the capacitance between the wearer and the environment. The WetTouch system exploits this effect and we present first findings on the feasibility of such detection. For this, a set of seven pertinent activities with and without touching water was measured, and we found that hand-washing is clearly identifiable for two different subjects. The technique hence paves the path towards reliable and unobtrusive hand-washing detection in ambulatory applications with capacitive sensing.","","978-1-6654-1647-4","10.1109/PerComWorkshops53856.2022.9767345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9767345","hand-washing;capacitive sensing;water;ground","Electrodes;Training;Conferences;Prototypes;Capacitance;Sensors;Recording","","","","33","IEEE","6 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In preparation for this world, integrative teaching and learning approaches that highlight connections between different concepts, and between theory and practice, develop the critical thinking attributes of engineering graduates. One means of facilitating integrative learning experiences that was further impelled by the COVID19 disruption is the adoption of digital tools within a hybrid module design. This paper presents and evaluates various digital interventions within an integrative, hybrid-learning mode applied to a content-dense materials science module in the second year of a Bachelor of Engineering degree programme. The evaluation focuses on analysing students' perceptions on the effectiveness of the different digital tools that were used to support integrated learning in a theory-rich module. Quantitative and qualitative feedback drawn from questionnaires revealed that, overall, students valued the well-structured, logical online format of the module and recommended this as a standard for other modules. Students also expressed appreciation for the explicit theory-practice links in the case studies and virtual practical sessions. Challenges with time management were also highlighted with students associating this with the wide range of activities that are employed in a hybrid, integrated approach to module design. Additionally, it was clear that there is a wide range of digital fluency across the student cohort. Students' level of competence relating to basic computer and data analysis skills directly influences their ability to engage and perform well in activities that required these skills, such as the projects and virtual practical sessions. It was concluded that the success of the current approach in preparing students for supercomplexity relies on restructuring other curricular items in a similar digitally aided integrative manner whilst providing support for time management and digital skills.","","978-1-6654-7528-0","10.1109/WEEF-GEDC54384.2022.9996253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996253","integrative approach;hybrid learning;digital tools;supercomplexity;holistic learning","COVID-19;Materials science and technology;Data analysis;Hybrid learning;Engineering education;Standards","","","","26","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
