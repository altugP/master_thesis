Operations management research on remote and mobile healthcare interventions tends to focus solely on output efficiency and leaving the questions of output-outcome relations to clinical medicine. However, with preventive interventions output-outcome relation plays a critical role in defining life-cycle long costs, outcomes and production effects of the technological intervention. Healthcare operations management can offer a valuable framework for better understanding remote mobile service systems and their effects. In this paper we explore different types of efficiency implications using mobile phone based solutions as an interesting example. We discuss time and location constraints of traditional service provision and how mobile services can impact them. We conclude by defining a new approach to studying mobile interventions from an operations management perspective.","International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine and Social Medicine, Cancun, MEXICO, FEB 01-07, 2009",,nan,,

However, self reports are not sufficient to measure actual adherence. Recording and recognizing personal activities in a ubiquitous environment has thus emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we present a model-driven sensor data assessment mechanism capable of identifying high level adherence-related activity patterns from low level signals. The proposed intelligent sensing algorithm can learn from a population-based training data set and adapt quickly to an individual's exercise patterns using the acquired personal data. Upon the recognition of each activity, the system can further provide personalized feedback such as exercise coaching, fitness planning, and abnormal event detection. The resulted system demonstrates the feasibility of a portable real-time personalized adherence feedback system that could be used for advanced healthcare services.","24th Medical Informatics in Europe Conference (MIE), Pisa, ITALY, AUG 26-29, 2012",10.3233/978-1-61499-101-4-1050,Personalization; activity adherence; intelligent sensing; fitness planning; abnormal event detection,,

Narciss (2004, 2008) distinguishes two dimensions within the feedback, the semantic dimension and the structural dimension. This article aims to analyze, from the student's perspective, the semantic dimension of feedback in a virtual learning environment (VLE). Firstly, importance that VLE students give to feedback and its degree of personalization is analyzed. Later, the object of analysis is usefulness that students deem feedback should have, paying special attention to each of its semantic sub-dimensions (Narciss, 2004). A survey was conducted among students of Business Administration degree of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). 182 students took part, divided into two groups (pilot and control). It was proved that 90\% of students give great or very great importance to reception of feedback from their tutors, a relevance they consider to be higher than the one in a face-toface environment. This percentage is around 75\% with regard to importance given to the level of personalization of feedback. The development of a factor analysis has revealed that usefulness of personalized feedback perceived by the students can be subsumed under two large dimensions: the one that makes learning (related to its semantic dimension) easier and the motivational one (by allowing an easier and more fluid communication with the tutor, contributing not to leave the course, etc.) The latter dimension has also proved to be key in order to attain improvements in the students' satisfaction with the learning process. This research was funded by the Catalan government and the UOC, within the framework of projects to Improve Teaching Quality (ITQ).","12th European Conference e-Learning (ECEL), SKEMA Business School, Sophia Antipolis, FRANCE, OCT 30-31, 2013",,feedback; VLE; students; semantic dimension; motivations; satisfaction,,

Individuals generally set a ``count goal{''} and then monitor the frequency of these behaviours via a process of counting/recording (i.e., number of alcoholic drinks, number of dollars gambled). We argue that this approach, although a key feature of interventions, presents a range of challenges, including: confusion regarding what constitutes a count; remembering to keep count; and remembering to stop at a certain count. We argue that these inherent features of ``count goals{''} may serve to undermine treatment effectiveness for addictive behaviours and potentially other behaviour change interventions. Furthermore, given counting of specific behaviours occurs frequently within digital interventions (e.g., steps, cigarettes, drinks), these issues may be further exacerbated within mHealth (interventions delivered through mobile digital devices). In this article, we offer an alternative to setting ``count goals{''} as part of a behavioural intervention. This approach directly limits a problem behaviour by constraining the time period, and rate of that behaviour, with no requirement to count or record the frequency of the behaviour-we refer to this as the ``Chronos Approach.{''} We suggest that this approach lends itself particularly well to mHealth interventions, whereby daily reminders and timed alerts can be easily programmed into a smartphone. We discuss the advantages of this method and illustrate how it can be effectively incorporated into mHealth behaviour interventions, providing a specific example of an alcohol reduction smartphone app wherein the Chronos Approach has been implemented.",nan,10.1111/cp.12226,addictive behaviours; alcohol problems; Chronos Approach; digital health; goal-setting; interventions; smartphone; time-based goals,,

Currently, several medical health (mHealth) apps for GD exist, but none are empirically validated and, even though they could be potentially useful, these interventions are static, reactive approaches and they are not based on the geo-fencing principle. Advances in smartphone technology now allow for a paradigm shift. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) are technology-based dynamic interventions that proactively respond to time-varying information to provide intervention at critical moments. In this paper, a novel JITAI mHealth app for GD called ``Don't Go There{''} (DGT) is presented. It capitalizes on smartphones' global positioning software (GPS) or other zero-permission embedded sensors to recognizes a user's location. When the patient turns off the GPS capabilities, we infer the geolocation solving a probabilistic route matching problem. The purpose of DGT is to construct a geofence around a gambler's favored gambling establishment, to discourage participation. We hypothesize that the deployment of this app could lead to a reduction in gambling behavior and problems and improve psychological functioning.","IEEE 17th Annual Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC), Las Vegas, NV, JAN 10-13, 2020",,localization; GPS; geofence; mobile sensors; mHealth,,

METHODS: The OL@-OR@ mHealth programme was a co-designed smartphone app. Culturally relevant data was collected to examine holistic health and wellbeing status, at baseline, and at 12 weeks (end of the trial). The concept of wellbeing was examined as part of a two-arm, cluster randomised trial, using only the Pasifika data: 389 (of 726) Pasifika adults were randomised to receive the mHealth intervention, while 405 (of 725) Pasifika adults were randomised to receive a control version of the intervention. Culturally relevant data was collected to examine holistic health and wellbeing status, at baseline, and at 12 weeks (end of the trial). The intervention effects and the association of demographic and behavioural relationships with wellbeing, was examined using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, there were significant differences between the intervention and control groups for the `family/community' wellbeing, at the end of the 12-week trial. There were no significant differences observed for all other wellbeing domains for both groups. Based on our multivariate regression analyses, education and acculturation (assimilation and marginalisation) were identified as positively strong factors associated to Pasifika `family and community' wellbeing.

However, mindfulness mobile apps have not been tested for their effects on rumination, especially among adolescents. Thus, we aimed to test the acceptability and effects of a mindfulness mobile intervention among ruminative adolescents using a within-subjects pretest/posttest design. Participants were 80 adolescents ages 12-15, selected for moderate-to-high rumination (M age = 14.01, SD = .99; 46.2\% girls; 86.25\% White; 3.75\% Hispanic). We asked adolescents to use our mindfulness app 3 times per day for 3 weeks. Participants and parents completed questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 and 12 weeks later. Acceptability was assessed by tracking app use and asking adolescents and parents to report on their experiences post-intervention. We assessed repetitive negative thinking (i.e., rumination and worry) and internalizing symptoms via self- and parent-report. The intervention demonstrated acceptability, and there were significant reductions in rumination, worry, anxiety and parent-reported internalizing symptoms post-intervention. Effects on rumination, anxiety and internalizing symptoms persisted throughout the 12-week follow-up with large effect sizes using an intention-to-treat approach. Thus, a brief mindfulness mobile app intervention appeared to be both engaging and helpful in reducing negative repetitive thinking and internalizing symptoms among ruminative adolescents.

We aimed to establish the feasibility of undertaking a definitive randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a blended digital intervention for relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Methods This multicentre, feasibility, cluster randomised controlled trial aimed to compare Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER) with treatment as usual in community mental health services (CMHS) in Glasgow and Melbourne. CMHS were the unit of randomisation, selected on the basis of those that probably had five or more care coordinators willing to participate. Participants were eligible if they were older than 16 years, had a schizophrenia or related diagnosis confirmed via case records, were able to provide informed consent, had contact with CMHS, and had had a relapse within the previous 2 years. Participants were randomised within stratified clusters to EMPOWER or to continue their usual approach to care. EMPOWER blended a smartphone for active monitoring of early warning signs with peer support to promote self-management and clinical triage to promote access to relapse prevention. Main outcomes were feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety, which was assessed through face-to-face interviews. App usage was assessed via the smartphone and self-report. Primary end point was 12 months. Participants, research assistants and other team members involved in delivering the intervention were not masked to treatment conditions. Assessment of relapse was done by an independent adjudication panel masked to randomisation group. The study is registered at ISRCTN (99559262). Findings We identified and randomised eight CMHS (six in Glasgow and two in Melbourne) comprising 47 care coordinators. We recruited 86 service users between Jan 19 and Aug 8, 2018; 73 were randomised (42 158\%1 to EMPOWER and 31 142\%] to treatment as usual). There were 37 (51\%) men and 36 (49\%) women. At 12 months, main outcomes were collected for 32 (76\%) of service users in the EMPOWER group and 30 (97\%) of service users in the treatment as usual group. Of those randomised to EMPOWER, 30 (71\%) met our a priori criterion of more than 33\% adherence to daily monitoring that assumed feasibility. Median time to discontinuation of these participants was 31-S weeks (SD 14.5). There were 29 adverse events in the EMPOWER group and 25 adverse events in the treatment as usual group. There were 13 app-related adverse events, affecting 11 people, one of which was serious. Fear of relapse was lower in the EMPOWER group than in the treatment as usual group at 12 months (mean difference -7.53 (95\% CI -14.45 to 0.60; Cohen's d-0.53). Interpretation A trial of digital technology to monitor early warning signs blended with peer support and clinical triage to detect and prevent relapse appears to be feasible, safe, and acceptable.

The objective of this study was to refine a mobile contingency management approach to reduce cannabis use to ultimately evaluate whether reductions in frequency and quantity of cannabis are related to improvements in functional and mental health status. Three cohorts of participants (n = 18 total, n = 10 women) were enrolled and completed 2 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) during a baseline ad lib cannabis use period, followed by a 6 -week reduction period. Participants completed EMA assessments multiple times per day and were prompted to provide videotaped saliva cannabis testing 2-3 times daily. Data from participants who were at least 80\% adherent to all EMA prompts were analyzed (13 out of 18). During the ad lib phase, participants were using cannabis on 94\% of the days and reported using a mean of 1.42 grams daily. The intervention was a mobile application that participants used to record cannabis use by saliva tests to bioverify abstinence and participants completed electronic diaries to report their grams used. During the 6 -week intervention phase, participants reported reducing their use days to 47\% of the days with a reported mean of .61 grams daily. In the last cohort, at least 50\% of the heavy users were able to reduce their cannabis use by at least 50\%. The effect of cannabis reduction (versus abstinence) is largely unknown. Observations suggest that it is possible to develop a mobile intervention to reduce cannabis use among heavy users, and this paradigm can be utilized in future work to evaluate whether reductions in cannabis use among heavy users will result in improvements in functional and mental health status.",nan,,cannabis; contingency management; cannabis use dis- order,,

Users' baseline characteristics were used as predictors of the profiles. The role of engagement with the app in the transition profiles was examined. Method: A total of 541 users completed the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 and the General Anxiety Disorder -7 when started using the app and 30 days after. Random -Intercept Latent Transition Analysis was implemented to identify users' profiles and transition patterns as classes. The age of the users and the Emotional Self -Awareness Scale -Revised (ESAS-R) were used as predictors of class membership at baseline. The Homework Rating Scale -Mobile Application (HRSMA; as a measure of engagement) was used as a predictor of class membership at 30 days of app use. Results: A 3 class solution was obtained according to the severity of symptoms (from mild to moderately severe). Age and ESAS-R predicted class membership initially; the higher the age and ESAS-R, the higher the probability of starting using the app with lower distress levels. The HRS-MA predicted class membership at 30 days of app use; the higher the engagement for more symptomatic and younger users, the higher the probability of improvement. However, older users tended to engage less. Conclusion: Our findings underpin the relevance of easily accessible digital interventions for young adults with mild to moderate mental health problems.

P.",,English,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA","Background: Workplace mental health is an important global health concern. Objectives: This unblinded, phase -III, wait -listed cluster randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) psychoeducation program using a spaced education approach on mental health literacy (MHL) in the workplace. The main interest of this paper was the immediate and 3 -month medium -term effect of the program on the MHL of workers. The purposely built mHealth platform was also evaluated as a health -related app. Methods: The mHealth platform was designed using the principle of spaced education as a psychoeducation intervention program, with various modules of web -based and mobile materials presented to the participant in a progressive manner. Short quizzes at the end of each module ensured adequate learning, and successful completion qualified the learner to progress to the next level. The trial recruited 456 employees of specific industries with high levels of work -related stress. Participants who were nested in different offices or units were allocated into the intervention and wait -listed control groups using a block randomization process, with the office or unit as the cluster. A separate sample of 70 individual raters were used for the evaluation of the mHealth platform. The Australian National MHL and Stigma Survey and the Mobile Apps Rating Scale were completed through a web -based self -reported survey to assess MHL and evaluate the app. The trial and follow-up data were analyzed by a generalized linear latent and mixed model with adjustments for the clustering effect of work sites and repeated measures. Results: Of the 456 participants in the trial, 236 (51.8\%) responded to the follow-up survey. Most MHL outcomes obtained significant results immediately after the intervention and across time. After adjusting for the clustering effect, the postintervention weighted mean scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than the control group for correct recognition of a mental health problem, help seeking, and stigmatization by 0.2 (SE 0.1; P =.003), 0.9 (SE 0.2; P <.001), and 1.8 (SE 0.4; P <.001), respectively. After adjusting for the clustering effect, significant differences across time were found in help -seeking intention ( P =.01), stigmatization ( P <.001), and social distancing ( P <.001). The evaluation of the mHealth program resulted in average scores of the 4 major domains ranging from 3.8 to 4.2, with engagement having the lowest score. Conclusions: The mHealth psychoeducation intervention program using this platform had immediate and 3 -month mediumterm effects of retaining and improving MHL. The platform was evaluated to have satisfactory performance in terms of functionality, aesthetics, information content, and utility in enhancing MHL. It is anticipated that ongoing development in digital health will provide great benefits in improving the mental health of the global population.",nan,10.2024/1/e51791,mHealth; web-based intervention; mental health literacy; psychoeducation; randomized controlled trial; workplace; performance; worker; intervention; digital health; mental wellness; promote; well-being; mobile health; technology,,

Many current physical activity behavioral interventions have shown limited success addressing the problem from a long-term perspective that includes maintenance. This paper proposes the design of a decision algorithm for a mobile and wireless health (mHealth) adaptive intervention that is based on control engineering concepts. The design process relies on a behavioral dynamical model based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), with a controller formulation based on hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) being used to implement the decision scheme. The discrete and logical features of HMPC coincide naturally with the categorical nature of the intervention components and the logical decisions that are particular to an intervention for physical activity. The intervention incorporates an online controller reconfiguration mode that applies changes in the penalty weights to accomplish the transition between the behavioral initiation and maintenance training stages. Controller performance is illustrated using an ARX model estimated from system identification data of a representative participant for Just Walk, a physical activity intervention designed on the basis of control systems principles.","",10.4995/riai.2022.16798,"",,

However, violent crimes and other hate incidents against SGM persons are consistently not reported and prosecuted because of chronic distrust between the SGM community and police. Brazil is one of the most dangerous countries for SGM persons in the world. Herein we describe the development of a mobile health intervention to address the rampant violence against this population, the Rainbow Resistance - Dandarah app. METHODS: We conducted community-based participatory research (CBPR) between 2019-2020. The study started with in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with representatives of the SGM community from Brazil. Descriptive qualitative data analysis included the plotting of a 'word cloud', to visually represent word frequency, data coding and analysis of more frequent themes related to app acceptability, usability, and feasibility. A sub-sample of SGM tested the app and suggested improvements, and the final version was launched in December 2019. RESULTS: Since the app was launched in December 2019, the app recorded 4,114 active SGM users. Most participants are cisgender men (50.9%), self-identified as gay (43.5%), White (47.3%), and aged 29 or less (60.9%). FGDs and IDIs participants discussed the importance of the app in the context of widespread violence toward SGM persons. Study participants perceived this mHealth strategy as an important, effective, and accessible strategy for SGM surviving violence. The CBPR design was highlighted as a key strategy that allowed SGM persons to collaborate in the design of this intervention actively. Some users reported how the panic button saved their lives during violent attacks. CONCLUSIONS: Rainbow Resistance - Dandarah app was endorsed as a powerful tool for enhancing reporting episodes of violence/discrimination against SGM persons and a key strategy to connect users with a safe network of supportive services. Results indicate that the app is an engaging, acceptable, and potentially effective mHealth intervention. Participants reported many advantages of using it, such as being able to report harassment and violence, connect with a safe network and receive immediate support.","",10.21203/rs.3.rs-2034975/v1,"",,
rayyan-28721336,Harnessing context sensing to develop a mobile intervention for depression,2011.0,1,1,,,,,,"MN Burns, M Begale, J Duffecy, D Gergle…",,,jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Mobile phone sensors can be used to develop context-aware systems that automatically detect when patients require assistance. Mobile phones can also provide ecological momentary interventions that deliver tailored assistance during problematic situations. However, such approaches have not yet been used to treat major depressive disorder.


Objective:
The purpose of this study was to investigate the technical feasibility, functional reliability, and patient satisfaction with Mobilyze!, a mobile phone- and Internet-based intervention including ecological momentary intervention and context sensing.


Methods:
We developed a mobile phone application and supporting architecture, in which machine learning models (ie, learners) predicted patients’ mood, emotions, cognitive/motivational states, activities, environmental context, and social context based on at least 38 concurrent phone sensor values (eg, global positioning system, ambient light, recent calls). The website included feedback graphs illustrating correlations between patients’ self-reported states, as well as didactics and tools teaching patients behavioral activation concepts. Brief telephone calls and emails with a clinician were used to promote adherence. We enrolled 8 adults with major depressive disorder in a single-arm pilot study to receive Mobilyze! and complete clinical assessments for 8 weeks.


Results:
Promising accuracy rates (60% to 91%) were achieved by learners predicting categorical contextual states (eg, location). For states rated on scales (eg, mood), predictive capability was poor. Participants were satisfied with the phone application and improved significantly on self-reported depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.82, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.43) and interview measures of depressive symptoms (betaweek = –.81, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 3.55). Participants also became less likely to meet criteria for major depressive disorder diagnosis (bweek = –.65, P = .03, per-protocol remission rate = 85.71%). Comorbid anxiety symptoms also decreased (betaweek = –.71, P < .001, per-protocol Cohen d = 2.58).


Conclusions:
Mobilyze! is a scalable, feasible intervention with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To our knowledge, it is the first ecological momentary intervention for unipolar depression, as well as one of the first attempts to use context sensing to identify mental health-related states. Several lessons learned regarding technical functionality, data mining, and software development process are discussed.

rayyan-28721338,Use of the experience sampling method in the context of clinical trials,2016.0,1,1,,,,,,"SJW Verhagen, L Hasmi, M Drukker…",,,mentalhealth.bmj.com,,"Abstract

Objective The experience sampling method (ESM) is a structured diary technique to appraise subjective experiences in daily life. It is applied in psychiatric patients, as well as in patients with somatic illness. Despite the potential of ESM assessment, the improved logistics and its increased administration in research, its use in clinical trials remains limited. This paper introduces ESM for clinical trials in psychiatry and beyond.

Methods ESM is an ecologically valid method that yields a comprehensive view of an individual's daily life. It allows the assessment of various constructs (eg, quality of life, psychopathology) and psychological mechanisms (eg, stress-sensitivity, coping). These constructs are difficult to assess using cross-sectional questionnaires. ESM can be applied in treatment monitoring, as an ecological momentary intervention, in clinical trials, or in single case clinical trials. Technological advances (eg, smartphone applications) make its implementation easier.

Results Advantages of ESM are highlighted and disadvantages are discussed. Furthermore, the ecological nature of ESM data and its consequences are explored, including the potential pitfalls of ambiguously formulated research questions and the specificities of ESM in statistical analyses. The last section focuses on ESM in relation to clinical trials and discusses its future use in optimising clinical decision-making.

Conclusions ESM can be a valuable asset in clinical trial research and should be used more often to study the benefits of treatment in psychiatry and somatic health.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721347,An ecological momentary intervention for smoking cessation: evaluation of feasibility and effectiveness,2016.0,1,1,,,,,,"MS Businelle, P Ma, DE Kendzor, SG Frank…",,,jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Despite substantial public health progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking in the United States overall, smoking among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults remains high.


Objective:
To determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a novel smartphone-based smoking cessation app designed for socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.


Methods:
Participants were recruited from a safety-net hospital smoking cessation clinic in Dallas, Texas, and were followed for 13 weeks. All participants received standard smoking cessation clinic care (ie, group counseling and cessation pharmacotherapy) and a smartphone with a novel smoking cessation app (ie, Smart-T). The Smart-T app prompted 5 daily ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) for 3 weeks (ie, 1 week before cessation and 2 weeks after cessation). During the precessation period, EMAs were followed by messages that focused on planning and preparing for the quit attempt. During the postcessation period, participant responses to EMAs drove an algorithm that tailored messages to the current level of smoking lapse risk and currently present lapse triggers (eg, urge to smoke, stress). Smart-T offered additional intervention features on demand (eg, one-click access to the tobacco cessation quitline; “Quit Tips” on coping with urges to smoke, mood, and stress).


Results:
Participants (N=59) were 52.0 (SD 7.0) years old, 54% (32/59) female, and 53% (31/59) African American, and 70% (40/57) had annual household income less than US $16,000. Participants smoked 20.3 (SD 11.6) cigarettes per day and had been smoking for 31.6 (SD 10.9) years. Twelve weeks after the scheduled quit date, 20% (12/59) of all participants were biochemically confirmed abstinent. Participants responded to 87% of all prompted EMAs and received approximately 102 treatment messages over the 3-week EMA period. Most participants (83%, 49/59) used the on-demand app features. Individuals with greater nicotine dependence and minority race used the Quit Tips feature more than their counterparts. Greater use of the Quit Tips feature was linked to nonabstinence at the 2 (P=.02), 4 (P<.01), and 12 (P=.03) week follow-up visits. Most participants reported that they actually used or implemented the tailored app-generated messages and suggestions (83%, 49/59); the app-generated messages were helpful (97%, 57/59); they would like to use the app in the future if they were to lapse (97%, 57/59); and they would like to refer friends who smoke to use the Smart-T app (85%, 50/59). A minority of participants (15%, 9/59) reported that the number of daily assessments (ie, 5) was “too high.”


Conclusions:
This novel just-in-time adaptive intervention delivered an intensive intervention (ie, 102 messages over a 3-week period), was well-liked, and was perceived as helpful and useful by socioeconomically disadvantaged adults who were seeking smoking cessation treatment. Smartphone apps may be used to increase treatment exposure and may ultimately reduce tobacco-related health disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults.

rayyan-28721356,A mobile just-in-time adaptive intervention for smoking cessation: pilot randomized controlled trial,2020.0,1,1,,,,,,"ET Hébert, CK Ra, AC Alexander, A Helt…",,,jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Smartphone apps for smoking cessation could offer easily accessible, highly tailored, intensive interventions at a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling. Although there are hundreds of publicly available smoking cessation apps, few have been empirically evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The Smart-Treatment (Smart-T2) app is a just-in-time adaptive intervention that uses ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to assess the risk for imminent smoking lapse and tailors treatment messages based on the risk of lapse and reported symptoms.


Objective:
This 3-armed pilot RCT aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an automated smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention (Smart-T2) relative to standard in-person smoking cessation clinic care and the National Cancer Institute’s free smoking cessation app, QuitGuide.


Methods:
Adult smokers who attended a clinic-based tobacco cessation program were randomized into groups and followed for 13 weeks (1 week prequitting through 12 weeks postquitting). All study participants received nicotine patches and gum and were asked to complete EMAs five times a day on study-provided smartphones for 5 weeks. Participants in the Smart-T2 group received tailored treatment messages after the completion of each EMA. Both Smart-T2 and QuitGuide apps offer on-demand smoking cessation treatment.


Results:
Of 81 participants, 41 (50%) were women and 55 (68%) were white. On average, participants were aged 49.6 years and smoked 22.4 cigarettes per day at baseline. A total of 17% (14/81) of participants were biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinent at 12 weeks postquitting (Smart-T2: 6/27, 22%, QuitGuide: 4/27, 15%, and usual care: 4/27, 15%), with no significant differences across groups (P>.05). Participants in the Smart-T2 group rated the app positively, with most participants agreeing that they can rely on the app to help them quit smoking, and endorsed the belief that the app would help them stay quit, and these responses were not significantly different from the ratings given by participants in the usual care group.


Conclusions:
Dynamic smartphone apps that tailor intervention content in real time may increase user engagement and exposure to treatment-related materials. The results of this pilot RCT suggest that smartphone-based smoking cessation treatments may be capable of providing similar outcomes to traditional, in-person counseling.

rayyan-28721357,The design of ecological momentary assessment technologies,2020.0,1,1,,,,,,"K Doherty, A Balaskas, G Doherty",,,ieeexplore.ieee.org,,"Abstract:
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods and technologies, designed to support the self-report of experience in the moment of daily life, have long been considered poised to revolutionize human-centred research, the practice of design and mental healthcare. The history of EMA is inextricably linked to technology, and mobile devices embody many of the characteristics required to support these methods. However, significant barriers to the design and adoption of these systems remain, including challenges of user engagement, reporting burden, data validity and honest disclosure. While prior research has examined the feasibility of a variety of EMA systems, few reviews have attended to their design. Through inter-disciplinary narrative literature review (n = 342), this paper presents a characterization of the EMA technology design space, drawing upon a diverse set of literatures, contexts, applications and demographic groups. This paper describes the options and strategies available to the EMA systems designer, with an eye towards supporting the design and deployment of EMA technologies for research and clinical practice.","",,"",,

Background:
Alcohol use is a risk factor for the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among African American men who have sex with men (MSM). Mobile phone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMA) could minimize bias due to retrospective recall and thus provide a better understanding of the social and structural context of alcohol use and its relationship with HIV-related risk behaviors in this population as well as other highly stigmatized populations.


Objective:
We describe the study design and the implementation, feasibility, reactivity, and acceptability of an EMA study of alcohol use and HIV-related behaviors among African American MSM in Baltimore.


Methods:
Participants were recruited through flyers and word-of-mouth in Baltimore from September 2013 to November 2014. Each participant was loaned an Android smartphone and instructed to respond to multiple prompts from the mobile app for 4 weeks. Data were collected through (1) random prompts delivered three times daily assessing participants’ location, activity, mood, and social context, (2) daily prompts capturing drinking and sex events occurring in the past 24 hours, and (3) event-contingent responses collecting participants’ self-reported episodes of drinking.


Results:
A total of 16 participants enrolled in the study. The current analyses focused on 15 participants who completed at least 24 days of follow-up (mean follow-up time 29 days; range 24-35 days). Study participants (N=15) were a median 38 years of age (range 27-62 years) with low levels of income and educational attainment. Ten individuals self-reported living with HIV/AIDS, over half reported drinking alcohol at least 2-3 times a week, and a third reported binge drinking (ie, 6 or more drinks on one occasion) on a weekly basis. Based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score, nearly half were classified as hazardous drinkers (score 8-15) and a fifth were likely dependent (score ≥16). A total of 140 participant-initiated events were reported, and 75% of 1308 random prompts and 81% of 436 daily prompts delivered were answered. Of seven devices used during the study, five were reported lost by participants. We did not observe strong reactivity effects, and self-reported acceptability to study procedures was uniformly favorable.


Conclusions:
This study provides evidence to support the feasibility and acceptability of using EMA methods for collecting data on alcohol use among African American men who have sex with men living in urban settings. These data provide the basis for future studies of EMA-informed mHealth interventions to promote the reduction of substance use and HIV risk-taking behaviors among African American MSM living in urban settings.

Abstract
Background

Smartphone apps can provide real-time, tailored interventions for smoking cessation. The current study examines the effectiveness of a smartphone-based smoking cessation application that assessed risk for imminent smoking lapse multiple times per day and provided messages tailored to current smoking lapse risk and specific lapse triggers.

Methods

Participants (N = 59) recruited from a safety-net hospital smoking cessation clinic completed phone-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) 5 times/day for 3 consecutive weeks (1 week pre-quit, 2 weeks post-quit). Risk for smoking lapse was estimated in real-time using a novel weighted lapse risk estimator. With each EMA, participants received messages tailored to current level of risk for imminent smoking lapse and self-reported presence of smoking urge, stress, cigarette availability, and motivation to quit. Generalized linear mixed model analyses determined whether messages tailored to specific lapse risk factors were associated with greater reductions in these triggers than messages not tailored to specific triggers.

Results

Overall, messages tailored to smoking urge, cigarette availability, or stress corresponded with greater reductions in those triggers than messages that were not tailored to specific triggers (p's = 0.02 to < 0.001). Although messages tailored to stress were associated with greater reductions in stress than messages not tailored to stress, the association was non-significant (p = 0.892) when only moments of high stress were included in the analysis.

Conclusions

Mobile technology can be used to conduct real-time smoking lapse risk assessment and provide tailored treatment content. Findings provide initial evidence that tailored content may impact users' urge to smoke, stress, and cigarette availability.","",,"",,

Background:
Real-time ecological momentary interventions have shown promising effects in domains other than alcohol use; however, only few studies regarding ecological momentary interventions for alcohol use have been conducted thus far. The increasing popularity of smartphones offers new avenues for intervention and innovation in data collection.


Objective:
We aimed to test the efficacy of an ecological momentary intervention, comprising mobile Web-based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and text messaging (short message service, SMS) brief interventions, delivered during drinking events using participants’ mobile phones.


Methods:
We conducted a three-armed randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of a mobile Web-based ecological momentary assessment with texting feedback on self-reported alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms in young adults. Participants were enrolled from an existing observational cohort study of young adults screened for risky drinking behavior. The intervention group (ecological momentary intervention group) completed repeated ecological momentary assessments during 6 drinking events and received immediate texting-based feedback in response to each ecological momentary assessment. The second group (ecological momentary assessment group) completed ecological momentary assessments without the brief intervention, and the third did not receive any contact during the trial period. Recent peak risky single-occasion drinking was assessed at the baseline and follow-up using telephone interviews. We used a random effects mixed modeling approach using maximum likelihood estimation to provide estimates of differences in mean drinking levels between groups between baseline and 12-week follow-up.


Results:
A total of 269 participants were randomized into the 3 groups. The ecological momentary intervention group exhibited a small and nonsignificant increase between baseline and follow-up in (geometric) the mean number of standard drinks consumed at the most recent heavy drinking occasion (mean 12.5 vs 12.7). Both ecological momentary assessment and control groups exhibited a nonsignificant decrease (ecological momentary assessment: mean 13.8 vs 11.8; control: mean 12.3 vs 11.6); these changes did not differ significantly between groups (Wald χ22 1.6; P=.437) and the magnitude of the effects of the intervention were markedly small. No other significant differences between groups on measures of alcohol consumption or related harms were observed. The intervention acceptability was high despite the technical problems in delivery.


Conclusions:
With a small number of participants, this study showed few effects of an SMS-based brief intervention on peak risky single-occasion drinking. Nevertheless, the study highlights areas for further investigation into the effects of EMI on young adults with heavy alcohol consumption.

rayyan-28721368,Assessing real-time moderation for developing adaptive mobile health interventions for medical interns: micro-randomized trial,2020.0,1,1,,,,,,"T NeCamp, S Sen, E Frank, MA Walton…",,,jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Individuals in stressful work environments often experience mental health issues, such as depression. Reducing depression rates is difficult because of persistently stressful work environments and inadequate time or resources to access traditional mental health care services. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions provide an opportunity to deliver real-time interventions in the real world. In addition, the delivery times of interventions can be based on real-time data collected with a mobile device. To date, data and analyses informing the timing of delivery of mHealth interventions are generally lacking.


Objective:
This study aimed to investigate when to provide mHealth interventions to individuals in stressful work environments to improve their behavior and mental health. The mHealth interventions targeted 3 categories of behavior: mood, activity, and sleep. The interventions aimed to improve 3 different outcomes: weekly mood (assessed through a daily survey), weekly step count, and weekly sleep time. We explored when these interventions were most effective, based on previous mood, step, and sleep scores.


Methods:
We conducted a 6-month micro-randomized trial on 1565 medical interns. Medical internship, during the first year of physician residency training, is highly stressful, resulting in depression rates several folds higher than those of the general population. Every week, interns were randomly assigned to receive push notifications related to a particular category (mood, activity, sleep, or no notifications). Every day, we collected interns’ daily mood valence, sleep, and step data. We assessed the causal effect moderation by the previous week’s mood, steps, and sleep. Specifically, we examined changes in the effect of notifications containing mood, activity, and sleep messages based on the previous week’s mood, step, and sleep scores. Moderation was assessed with a weighted and centered least-squares estimator.


Results:
We found that the previous week’s mood negatively moderated the effect of notifications on the current week’s mood with an estimated moderation of −0.052 (P=.001). That is, notifications had a better impact on mood when the studied interns had a low mood in the previous week. Similarly, we found that the previous week’s step count negatively moderated the effect of activity notifications on the current week’s step count, with an estimated moderation of −0.039 (P=.01) and that the previous week’s sleep negatively moderated the effect of sleep notifications on the current week’s sleep with an estimated moderation of −0.075 (P<.001). For all three of these moderators, we estimated that the treatment effect was positive (beneficial) when the moderator was low, and negative (harmful) when the moderator was high.


Conclusions:
These findings suggest that an individual’s current state meaningfully influences their receptivity to mHealth interventions for mental health. Timing interventions to match an individual’s state may be critical to maximizing the efficacy of interventions.

Abstract
Background

Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) influence behavior in real time, in real life. We evaluated trial feasibility and preliminary efficacy of MOMENT, a counseling-plus-EMI to reduce frequent marijuana use in youth in primary care.

Methods

Primary care patients age 15–24 years using marijuana at least 3 times/week were randomized to MOMENT [motivational enhancement therapy (MET)/smartphone-based momentary assessment/responsive motivational messaging] vs. No-messages (MET/momentary assessment) vs. MET-only. In MOMENT, two MET sessions were followed by 2 weeks of momentary assessment of marijuana use and factors related to use, with motivational messaging displayed after report of marijuana triggers, desire, use, and effort to avoid use. We evaluated study feasibility (recruitment, retention, and response rates; feedback survey responses) and explored intervention effects on marijuana desire and use at three months with linear mixed effects modeling.

Results

Seventy youth [mean (M) =20.7 years, 60% female] were assigned to MOMENT (n=27), No-messages (n=15; assignment suspended to enrich other arms), or MET-only (n=28). Most attrition occurred during baseline, before MET. Of those completing MET session 1, 82% completed their assigned treatment and 79% provided 3-month data. Participants highly rated acceptability; comments reflected changing motivation and behavior. Across arms, participants reported significantly lower marijuana use, desire, and problems at follow-up vs. baseline. Momentary marijuana desire declined more in MOMENT vs. MET-only. Marijuana use following a targeted context or behavior was less likely in MOMENT and No-messages, vs. MET-only.

Conclusions

The MOMENT intervention is feasible to deliver, acceptable, and potentially efficacious in reducing marijuana desire and use among adolescent and young adults in primary care. A larger randomized trial to evaluate efficacy is warranted.

rayyan-28721371,m-Path: An easy-to-use and flexible platform for ecological momentary assessment and intervention in behavioral research and clinical practice,2022.0,1,1,,,,,,"M Mestdagh, S Verdonck, M Piot, K Niemeijer…",,,researchgate.net,,"Abstract
In this paper, we present m-Path (www.m-Path.io), an online platform that provides a user-friendly and flexible framework for implementing smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and intervention (EMI) in both research and clinical practice in the context of blended care. Because real-time monitoring and intervention in people’s everyday lives have unparalleled benefits compared to traditional data collection techniques (e.g., experiments or retrospective surveys), EMA and EMI have become popular in recent years. On the one hand, the surge in use of these methods requires software that allows for increasingly complex designs and functionalities. On the other hand, EMA and EMI platforms should remain easy to use and accessible for researchers and clinicians with limited programming skills. m-Path accommodates to both of these needs, offering an intuitive web interface to set up highly tailorable smartphone-based EMA and EMI protocols. In this article, we review the strengths of daily life data collection and intervention in general and m-Path in particular. We discuss the regular workflow to design an EMA or EMI protocol within the m-Path framework, and summarize both the basic functionalities and more advanced features of our software.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721372,Mobile health technology using a wearable sensorband for female college students with problem drinking: an acceptability and feasibility study,2017.0,1,1,,,,,,"NR Leonard, M Silverman, DP Sherpa…",,,mhealth.jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
An increasing number of mobile app interventions have been developed for problem drinking among college students; however, few studies have examined the integration of a mobile app with continuous physiological monitoring and alerting of affective states related to drinking behaviors.


Objective:
The aim of this paper was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of Mind the Moment (MtM), a theoretically based intervention for female college students with problem drinking that combines brief, in-person counseling with ecological momentary intervention (EMI) on a mobile app integrated with a wearable sensorband.


Methods:
We recruited 10 non-treatment seeking, female undergraduates from a university health clinic who scored a 3 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption (AUDIT-C) to participate in this pilot study. Study activities involved an in-person baseline intake and 1 follow-up assessment, 2 in-person alcohol brief intervention counseling sessions, and use of MtM technology components (sensorband and EMI on a mobile app) for approximately 3-4 weeks. The intervention used motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies for reducing risks associated with drinking. We used both qualitative and quantitative assessments to measure acceptability of the intervention and feasibility of delivery. Use patterns of the sensorband and mobile app were also collected.


Results:
Quantitative and qualitative data indicated high levels of acceptability for the MtM intervention. Altogether, participants made reports on the app on 26.7% (78/292) the days the technology was available to them and completed a total of 325 reports with wide variation between participants. Qualitative findings indicated that sensorband-elicited alerts promoted an increase in awareness of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to current environmental stressors and drinking behaviors in theoretically meaningful ways. Specific challenges related to functionality and form of the sensorband were identified.


Conclusions:
Delivering intervention material “just-in-time,” at the moment participants need to use behavioral strategies has great potential to individualize behavioral interventions for reducing problem drinking and other health behaviors. These findings provide initial evidence for the promise of wearable sensors for increasing potency of theoretically grounded mobile health interventions and point to directions for future research and uptake of these technologies.

Abstract

This study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of an interactive smartphone application that aimed to improve daily-life social functioning and symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) with Experience Sampling Method (ESM) derived personalised feedback.Two groups of outpatients with a diagnosis of SZ were included (one receiving ESM-derived personalised feedback (n = 27) and one without feedback (n = 23)) and used the interactive smartphone application for three weeks. Main outcomes were momentary symptoms and social functioning, as assessed by ESM questionnaires. Additionally, feasibility and user-friendliness of the application were assessed. The response rate was 64% for the ESM questionnaires. In the feedback group, participants indicated that on 49% of the ESM days they acted on at least one personalised feedback prompt per day. Momentary psychotic symptoms significantly decreased over time only in the feedback group. Momentary loneliness and questionnaire-assessed psychotic symptoms decreased over time, irrespective of feedback. Participants evaluated the app as user-friendly and understandable. Momentary personalised feedback may impact momentary psychosis in daily life. Feelings of loneliness and questionnaire-based measured psychotic symptoms may be more responsive to non-specific effects of daily-life self-monitoring, not requiring specific feedback. Ecological momentary interventions offer opportunities for accessible and effective interventions in SZ.","",,"",,

Abstract

Common approaches to the psychological treatment of distressing voice hearing experiences, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, aim to promote more adaptive cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses to these experiences. Digital technologies such as smartphones show promise for supporting and enhancing these treatments by linking immediate therapeutic settings to the context of daily life. Two promising technologies include ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I), which may offer a means of advanced assessment and support in daily life, and inform the tailoring of interventions to suit individual needs. In this study, a highly novel intervention approach was developed involving four face-to-face sessions with a psychologist blended with EMA/I between sessions in order to improve coping with distressing voice hearing experiences. The authors describe the background and development of this approach along-side a single case illustration, which supported feasibility and acceptability. This study details how digital technologies such as EMA/I may be used in future as clinical tools to enhance standard psychological treatments and clinical care of people with persisting and distressing experiences.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721381,Recurrent neural networks in mobile sampling and intervention,2019.0,1,1,,,,,,"G Koppe, S Guloksuz, U Reininghaus…",,,academic.oup.com,,"The rapid rise and now widespread distribution of handheld and wearable devices, such as smartphones, fitness trackers, or smartwatches, has opened a new universe of possibilities for monitoring emotion and cognition in everyday-life context, and for applying experience- and context-specific interventions in psychosis. These devices are equipped with multiple sensors, recording channels, and app-based opportunities for assessment using experience sampling methodology (ESM), which enables to collect vast amounts of temporally highly resolved and ecologically valid personal data from various domains in daily life. In psychosis, this allows to elucidate intermediate and clinical phenotypes, psychological processes and mechanisms, and their interplay with socioenvironmental factors, as well as to evaluate the effects of treatments for psychosis on important clinical and social outcomes. Although these data offer immense opportunities, they also pose tremendous challenges for data analysis. These challenges include the sheer amount of time series data generated and the many different data modalities and their specific properties and sampling rates. After a brief review of studies and approaches to ESM and ecological momentary interventions in psychosis, we will discuss recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a powerful statistical machine learning approach for time series analysis and prediction in this context. RNNs can be trained on multiple data modalities simultaneously to learn a dynamical model that could be used to forecast individual trajectories and schedule online feedback and intervention accordingly. Future research using this approach is likely going to offer new avenues to further our understanding and treatments of psychosis.","",,"",,

Depression treatment might be enhanced by ecological momentary interventions (EMI) based on self-monitoring and person-specific feedback. This study is the first to examine the efficacy of two different EMI modules for depression in routine clinical practice.

Methods

Outpatients starting depression treatment at secondary mental health services (N = 161; MIDS−DEPRESSION = 35.9, S.D. = 10.7; MAGE = 32.8, S.D. = 12.1; 46% male) participated in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with three arms. Two experimental groups engaged in 28 days of systematic self-monitoring (5 times per day), and received weekly feedback on either positive affect and activities (Do-module) or negative affect and thinking patterns (Think-module). The control group received no additional intervention. Participants completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms (primary outcome), social functioning, and empowerment before and after the intervention period, and at four measurements during a 6-month follow-up period.

Results

Of the 90 (out of 110) participants who completed the intervention, 86% would recommend it. However, the experimental groups did not show significantly more or faster changes over time than the control group in terms of depressive symptoms, social functioning, and empowerment. Furthermore, the trajectories of the two EMI modules were very similar.

Conclusions

We did not find statistical evidence that this type of EMI augments the efficacy of regular depression treatment, regardless of module content. We cannot rule out that EMIs have a positive impact on other domains or provide a more efficient way of delivering care. Nonetheless, EMI's promise of effectiveness has not materialized yet.","",,"",,

Background:
Many suicide risk factors have been identified, but traditional clinical methods do not allow for the accurate prediction of suicide behaviors. To face this challenge, emma, an app for ecological momentary assessment (EMA), ecological momentary intervention (EMI), and prediction of suicide risk in high-risk patients, was developed.


Objective:
The aim of this case report study was to describe how subjects at high risk of suicide use the emma app in real-world conditions.


Methods:
The Ecological Mental Momentary Assessment (EMMA) study is an ongoing, longitudinal, interventional, multicenter trial in which patients at high risk for suicide are recruited to test emma, an app designed to be used as a self-help tool for suicidal crisis management. Participants undergo clinical assessment at months 0, 1, 3, and 6 after inclusion, mainly to assess and characterize the presence of mental disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Patient recruitment is still ongoing. Some data from the first 14 participants who already completed the 6-month follow-up were selected for this case report study, which evaluated the following: (1) data collected by emma (ie, responses to EMAs), (2) metadata on emma use, (3) clinical data, and (4) qualitative assessment of the participants' experiences.


Results:
EMA completion rates were extremely heterogeneous with a sharp decrease over time. The completion rates of the weekly EMAs (25%-87%) were higher than those of the daily EMAs (0%-53%). Most patients (10/14, 71%) answered the EMA questionnaires spontaneously. Similarly, the use of the Safety Plan Modules was very heterogeneous (2-75 times). Specifically, 11 patients out of 14 (79%) used the Call Module (1-29 times), which was designed by our team to help them get in touch with health care professionals and/or relatives during a crisis. The diversity of patient profiles and use of the EMA and EMI modules proposed by emma were highlighted by three case reports.


Conclusions:
These preliminary results indicate that patients have different clinical and digital profiles and needs that require a highly scalable, interactive, and customizable app. They also suggest that it is possible and acceptable to collect longitudinal, fine-grained, contextualized data (ie, EMA) and to offer personalized intervention (ie, EMI) in real time to people at high risk of suicide. To become a complementary tool for suicide prevention, emma should be integrated into existing emergency procedures.

Heavy alcohol use is a serious health issue in the United States with consequences such as illness, injury, and death. College students are among the most vulnerable to problems associated with risky drinking. This demographic is known as the Net Generation because members have grown up with digital technologies such as smartphones and apps. Thus, mobile health (mHealth) applications, successful in the delivery of health information and interventions to tech-savvy individuals, are a promising means of reaching them. To that end, we developed a smartphone application (SmarTrek) that targets college students and aims to reduce risky alcohol use. SmarTrek features are easy to use and have interactive components including text messages that incorporate motivational interviewing and ecological momentary interventions. We conducted iterative theater testing, field testing, and focus groups to evaluate the acceptability of SmarTrek with college students. We identified salient issues that might arise from SmarTrek use and modified the app based on feedback from participants. Participants were assigned to 2 groups (Group 1 [n = 4] and Group 2 [n = 6]). At baseline, participants completed 2 standardized surveys. Following their field testing, each group of participants was then invited to a focus group session of the app in which they provided feedback. The majority of participants (90%) agreed that SmarTrek was easy to use and that the information provided was useful and had a positive effect on decreasing their drinking.

Background:
Low uptake rates of traditional gambling treatments highlight the need for innovative treatment modalities. Smartphone apps can provide unprecedented access to real-time ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) delivered in people’s everyday lives.


Objective:
This study aims to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of GamblingLess: Curb Your Urge, the first smartphone app–delivered EMI that aims to prevent gambling episodes by reducing craving intensity in people seeking help for gambling problems.


Methods:
This study was a single-arm, 5-week acceptability and feasibility trial (1-week baseline and 4-week intervention periods) involving ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) delivered 3 times daily. The EMAs measured gambling episodes, cravings, and self-efficacy. Web-based evaluations at baseline, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up measured gambling outcomes (severity, cravings, frequency, expenditure, and self-efficacy) and the intervention’s perceived helpfulness, relevance, burden, satisfaction, and impact in relation to gambling cravings.


Results:
A total of 36 participants, of whom 22/36 (61%) were male and 34/36 (94%) were problem gamblers, completed the baseline measures, with 61% (22/36) completing the postintervention evaluation and 58% (21/36) completing the follow-up evaluation. The intervention was considered acceptable, as participants perceived all intervention content to be above average in helpfulness and the EMA to be highly relevant but somewhat burdensome. Participants reported that they were satisfied with the intervention and that the intervention improved their knowledge, attitudes, awareness, behavior change, intention to change, and help-seeking behavior for gambling cravings. Regarding the intervention’s feasibility, compliance rates for the EMA (51%) and EMI (15%) were low; however, the intervention was used 166 times, including 59 uses within 60 minutes of EMA completion and 107 on-demand uses. Regarding the intervention’s preliminary effectiveness, descriptive EMA data showed that, compared with the baseline period, 71% and 72% reductions in the average number of gambling episodes and craving occurrences were reported in the intervention period, respectively. In addition, clustered paired-sample two-tailed t tests revealed a significant 5.4% reduction in real-time craving intensity (P=.01) immediately after intervention use, which increased to 10.5% (P=.01), where use was recommended based on craving occurrence. At the group level, significant medium-to-large reductions were observed in mean gambling symptom severity (P=.01 and .003), cravings (P=.03 and .02), frequency (P=.01 and .004), and expenditure (P=.04 and .003) at postintervention and follow-up; moreover, increased mean gambling self-efficacy and craving self-efficacy (P=.01 and .01) were observed at postintervention and increased gambling self-efficacy (P=.04) was observed at follow-up. At the individual level, over a quarter of participants (6/22, 27% to 10/21, 48%) could be categorized as recovered or improved regarding their gambling symptom severity and cravings.


Conclusions:
The results support the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of this app-delivered EMI for preventing gambling episodes through craving management in people with gambling problems, which has implications for extending the reach of evidence-based treatment to moments of vulnerability in people’s everyday lives.

Abstract
Background

Tailoring healthcare to patients’ individual needs is a central goal of precision medicine. Combining smartphone-based interventions with machine learning approaches may help attaining this goal. The aim of our study was to explore the predictability of the success of smartphone-based psychotherapeutic micro-interventions in eliciting mood changes using machine learning.

Methods

Participants conducted daily smartphone-based psychotherapeutic micro-interventions, guided by short video clips, for 13 consecutive days. Participants chose one of four intervention techniques used in psychotherapeutic approaches. Mood changes were assessed using the Multidimensional Mood State Questionnaire. Micro-intervention success was predicted using random forest (RF) tree-based mixed-effects logistic regression models. Data from 27 participants were used, totaling 324 micro-interventions, randomly split 100 times into training and test samples, using within-subject and between-subject sampling.

Results

Mood improved from pre- to post-intervention in 137 sessions (initial success-rate: 42.3%). The RF approach resulted in predictions of micro-intervention success significantly better than the initial success-rate within and between subjects (positive predictive value: 0.732 (95%-CI: 0.607; 0.820) and 0.698 (95%-CI: 0.564; 0.805), respectively). Prediction quality was highest using the RF approach within subjects (rand accuracy: 0.75 (95%-CI: 0.641; 0.840), Matthew's correlation coefficient: 0.483 (95%-CI: 0.323; 0.723)).

Limitations

The RF approach does not allow firm conclusions about the exact contribution of each factor to the algorithm's predictions. We included a limited number of predictors and did not compare whether predictability differed between psychotherapeutic techniques.

Conclusions

Our findings may pave the way for translation and encourage scrutinizing personalized prediction in the psychotherapeutic context to improve treatment efficacy.","",,"",,

Background:
Digital interventions offer new avenues for low-threshold prevention and treatment in young people. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) represent a powerful approach that allows for adaptive, real-time, and real-world delivery of intervention components in daily life by real-time processing of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. Compassion-focused interventions (CFIs) may be particularly amenable to translation into an EMI to strengthen emotional resilience and modify putative risk mechanisms, such as stress sensitivity, in the daily lives of young help-seeking individuals.

This study aims to investigate the feasibility, safety, and initial therapeutic effects of a novel, accessible, transdiagnostic, ecological momentary CFI for improving emotional resilience to stress (EMIcompass).

In this uncontrolled pilot study, help-seeking youth with psychotic, depressive, or anxiety symptoms were offered the EMIcompass intervention in addition to treatment as usual. The EMIcompass intervention consisted of a 3-week EMI (including enhancing, consolidating, and EMA-informed interactive tasks) administered through a mobile health app and three face-to-face sessions with a trained psychologist intended to provide guidance and training on the CFI exercises presented in the app (ie, training session, follow-up booster session, and review session).


Results:
In total, 10 individuals (mean age 20.3 years, SD 3.8; range 14-25) were included in the study. Most (8/10, 80%) participants were satisfied and reported a low burden of app usage. No adverse events were observed. In approximately one-third of all EMAs, individuals scored high on stress, negative affect, or threat anticipation during the intervention period, resulting in real-time, interactive delivery of the CFI intervention components in addition to weekly enhancing and daily consolidating tasks. Although the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size, reduced stress sensitivity, momentary negative affect, and psychotic experiences, along with increased positive affect, were found at postintervention and the 4-week follow-up. Furthermore, reductions in psychotic, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were found (r=0.30-0.65).


Conclusions:
Our findings provide evidence on the feasibility and safety of the EMIcompass intervention for help-seeking youth and lend initial support to beneficial effects on stress sensitivity and mental health outcomes. An exploratory randomized controlled trial is warranted to establish the feasibility and preliminary evidence of its efficacy.

rayyan-28721400,"An open trial of a smartphone-assisted, adjunctive intervention to improve treatment adherence in bipolar disorder",2016.0,1,1,,,,,,"SJ Wenze, MF Armey, LM Weinstock…",,,journals.lww.com,,"Abstract

We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, 12-week, adjunctive, smartphone-assisted intervention to improve treatment adherence in bipolar disorder. Eight participants completed 4 in-person individual therapy sessions over the course of a month, followed by 60 days of twice-daily ecological momentary intervention (EMI) sessions, with a fifth in-person session after 30 days and a sixth in-person session after 60 days. Perceived credibility of the intervention and expectancy for change were adequate at baseline, and satisfaction on completion of the intervention was very high. Participants demonstrated good adherence to the intervention overall, including excellent adherence to the in-person component and fair adherence to the smartphone-facilitated component. Qualitative feedback revealed very high satisfaction with the in-person sessions and suggested a broad range of ways in which the EMI sessions were helpful. Participants also provided suggestions for improving the intervention, which primarily related to the structure and administration of the EMI (smartphone-administered) sessions. Although this study was not designed to evaluate treatment efficacy, most key outcome variables changed in the expected directions from pretreatment to posttreatment, and several variables changed significantly over the course of the in-person sessions or during the EMI phase. These findings add to the small but growing body of literature suggesting that EMIs are feasible and acceptable for use in populations with bipolar disorder.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721406,Exploring the features of an app-based just-in-time intervention for depression,2021.0,1,1,,,,,,"N Everitt, J Broadbent, B Richardson, JM Smyth…",,,Elsevier,,"Highlights

•

Emerging evidence supports the use of “just-in-time” micro-interventions for depression, however it remains unclear which features of such interventions have contributed to symptom improvement.

•

We evaluated three levels of features of micro-interventions against a wait-list control: mood tracking, mood tracking + content, mood tracking + content + just-in-time prompts.

•

Immediate improvements in mood were observed in micro-intervention content conditions, along with greater improvements in depressive and automatic negative symptoms.

•

The addition of just-in-time prompts to the micro-intervention did not appear to improve efficacy, contrary to expectation.

•

Our findings strengthen the evidence for micro-interventions, and have important implications for their effective design.

Abstract
Background

Technological advancements make it possible to deliver depression interventions via smartphone applications (“Apps”), including those that deliver content “just-in-time” (e.g., in response to acute negative mood states). This study examined whether an app-based just-in-time intervention (ImproveYourMood+) decreased depressive symptoms, and whether the following features were related to symptom improvement: micro-intervention content, mood monitoring, and just-in-time prompts to use content.

Methods

Participants (n = 235) from the general population who self-identified as wanting to improve their negative mood were randomised to a waitlist control group (n = 55) or one of three intervention groups: MoodTracker (monitoring-only, n = 58), ImproveYourMood (monitoring and content; n = 62), or ImproveYourMood+ (monitoring, content, and prompts; n = 60). The active intervention phase was 3 weeks. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, and negative automatic thoughts were assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and one month following post-intervention.

Results

Linear mixed modelling revealed greater declines over time in depressive and anxiety symptoms and negative automatic thoughts for the ImproveYourMood group (standardized mean differences [SMDs] ranged from .32 to .40) and improves for the ImproveYourMood+ group for negative automatic thoughts (SMDs ≥ .37) compared to the waitlist control group. No between-group differences were observed between the MoodTracker and control groups (SMDs = .04–.23). User experience appeared to be superior in more comprehensive/multi-modal versions.

Limitations

The study employed a naturalistic design, whereby participants self-selected to utilise the program, did not complete eligibility assessments, and did not receive compensation. The study therefore attained considerable drop-out rate (~50% by the follow-up timepoints), potentially reflecting the usage patterns of real-world mental health apps.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that micro-interventions can be an effective way to reduce depressive symptoms both in the moment and 1–2 months later. Integration of micro-interventions with full treatment programs is a viable next step in micro-intervention research.","",,"",,

•

Participants who heard voices found smartphone-based monitoring and coping prompts helpful in supporting face-to-face therapy

Monitoring symptoms in everyday life aided communication with the therapist, promoting efficiency and empathy

•

Smartphone notifications made participants feel more connected to their therapist, deepening the therapeutic relationship

Abstract

This study explored participants' experiences of a novel intervention blending ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/I) digital technologies with four face-to-face therapy sessions to improve coping in people who experience persisting auditory verbal hallucinations (hear voices). A smartphone app was used to deliver prompts to facilitate both self-monitoring and self-management of voices. Analysis of data recorded by the app was also used in-session to develop an idiographic formulation of antecedents of and responses to voice-hearing episodes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 participants who completed the blended therapy. A thematic approach was used to analyse the data, generating four main themes, with associated subthemes: (1) Therapy experience changed by digital technology; (2) Valuing face-to-face component; (3) Preference for different phases of the digital technology; (4) Not as bothered by voices. Key findings revealed that participants perceived EMA/I technology as helping capture their experience more accurately and communicate this more effectively to the therapist, which, in combination with coping prompts developed in-session, deepened the therapeutic relationship. These findings add to the emerging literature that shows blended therapy can play an important role in the treatment of people with psychosis, and suggest potential of EMA/I as a technology for other clinical populations.","",,"",,

•

A multi-component JITAI was delivered to individuals attempting to quit smoking.

•

Delivery of brief mindfulness/motivational strategies was generally feasible.

•

Mindfulness strategies for smoking cessation were perceived as highly acceptable.

Abstract

Smoking cessation treatments that are easily accessible and deliver intervention content at vulnerable moments (e.g., high negative affect) have great potential to impact tobacco abstinence. The current study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for smoking cessation. Daily smokers interested in quitting were consented to participate in a 6-week cessation study. Visit 1 occurred 4 days pre-quit, Visit 2 was on the quit day, Visit 3 occurred 3 days post-quit, Visit 4 was 10 days post-quit, and Visit 5 was 28 days post-quit. During the first 2 weeks (Visits 1–4), the JITAI delivered brief mindfulness/motivational strategies via smartphone in real-time based on negative affect or smoking behavior detected by wearable sensors. Participants also attended 5 in-person visits, where brief cessation counseling (Visits 1–4) and nicotine replacement therapy (Visits 2–5) were provided. Outcomes were feasibility and acceptability; biochemically-confirmed abstinence was also measured. Participants (N = 43) were 58.1 % female (AgeMean = 49.1, mean cigarettes per day = 15.4). Retention through follow-up was high (83.7 %). For participants with available data (n = 38), 24 (63 %) met the benchmark for sensor wearing, among whom 16 (67 %) completed at least 60 % of strategies. Perceived ease of wearing sensors (Mean = 5.1 out of 6) and treatment satisfaction (Mean = 3.6 out of 4) were high. Biochemically-confirmed abstinence was 34 % at Visit 4 and 21 % at Visit 5. Overall, the feasibility of this novel multi-component intervention for smoking cessation was mixed but acceptability was high. Future studies with improved technology will decrease participant burden and better detect key intervention moments.","",,"",,

•

Independent practice of cognitive behavioral therapy skills improves outcomes.

•

Patients reported modest reductions in negative affect after skills practice.

•

Immediate reductions were largely unrelated to clinical outcomes.

•

Outcomes were predicted by skills-related improvements in affect after a delay.

Abstract

The practice of therapeutic skills outside of sessions in which they are learned is one presumed key component of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Yet, our understanding of how skills practice relates to clinical outcomes remains limited. Here, we explored patients’ emotional responses to CBT skills practice in a pilot study pairing smartphone-app-delivered skills reminders and guided practice (ecological momentary intervention [EMI]) using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants (n = 25) were adults recently hospitalized for a suicide attempt or severe suicidal thinking. They received brief inpatient CBT (1 to 3 sessions covering core CBT skills from the Unified Protocol), followed by 1 month of EMI and EMA after discharge. On average, participants reported modest reductions in negative affect after skills use (i.e., immediate responses; median time elapsed = 4.30 minutes). Additionally, participants tended to report less negative affect when the timepoint preceding the current assessment included EMI skills practice, rather than EMA alone (i.e., delayed responses; median time elapsed between prompts = 2.17 hours). Immediate effects were unrelated to longer-term clinical outcomes, whereas greater delayed effects were associated with lower symptom severity at follow-up. Future studies should further examine how CBT skills use in daily life may alleviate symptoms.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721423,A randomized controlled trial of a 14-day mindfulness ecological momentary intervention (MEMI) for generalized anxiety disorder,2023.0,1,1,,,,,,"NH Zainal, MG Newman",,,cambridge.org,,"Background

Little is known about whether brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) yield clinically beneficial effects. This gap exists despite the rapid growth of smartphone mindfulness applications. Specifically, no prior brief MEMI has targeted generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Moreover, although theories propose that MEMIs can boost executive functioning (EF), they have largely gone untested. Thus, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to address these gaps by assessing the efficacy of a 14-day smartphone MEMI (versus self-monitoring placebo [SMP]).

Method

Participants with GAD were randomly assigned to either condition (68 MEMI and 42 SMP). MEMI participants exercised multiple core mindfulness strategies and were instructed to practice mindfulness continually. Comparatively, SMP participants were prompted to practice self-monitoring and were not taught any mindfulness strategies. All prompts occurred five times a day for 14 consecutive days. Participants completed self-reports and neuropsychological assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU). Piecewise hierarchical linear modeling analyses were conducted.

Results

MEMI (versus SMP) produced greater pre-1MFU reductions in GAD severity and perseverative cognitions (between-group d = 0.393–0.394) and stronger improvements in trait mindfulness and performance-based inhibition (d = 0.280–0.303). Further, MEMI (versus SMP) led to more considerable pre- to posttreatment reduction in state-level depression and anxiety and more mindfulness gains (d = 0.50–1.13). Overall, between-treatment effects were stronger at pre-1MFU than pre- to posttreatment for trait-level than state-level treatment outcome measures.

Conclusions

Preliminary findings suggest that the beneficial effect of an unguided brief MEMI to target pathological worry, trait mindfulness, and EF is modest yet potentially meaningful. Other theoretical and clinical implications were discussed.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721427,Ecological momentary assessments and interventions in Alzheimer's caregiving,2018.0,1,1,,,,,,C Lazzari,,,ingentaconnect.com,,"Background: Caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) often experience feelings of lack of support and information from specialists when operating in real scenarios, inclusive of old-age psychiatric wards, care homes, community, and patient's home.

Objective: AD caregivers can provide narrative about what issues need to be addressed in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to capture real-time and real-scenario needs in AD caregiving, and Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) as online e-learning to assist in areas of concerns.

Method: Twelve focus group discussions took place with AD caregivers for a total of 62 people interviewed. Once major themes in surveys and learning were identified by using discourse analysis, AD caregivers expressed the likelihood that these themes (where 0 meant “nil” and 1 meant “completely”) would address their focal needs in caregiving and topics in learning. Z scores for proportions and Cohen's d effect size were calculated for each item reporting the averaged scores.

Results: AD caregivers indicated that the major areas of concern that could benefit from an EMA/EMI online platform were: support (d=3.08), collaboration (d=1.85), medication review (d=1.21), dealing with grief and mourning, and time (d=0.97). Moreover, they identified personal resources available to provide help to colleagues: support (d=1.34), information (d=0.97), collaboration (d=2.06), hospital admission (d=3.08), and hospital discharge (d=5.50).

Conclusion: Focus groups and narratives can be the initial stage in creating a dedicated AD app supporting EMA/EMI in AD care.","",,"",,

Background: mobile applications (apps) facilitate cancer pain ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and provide more reliable data than retrospective monitoring. The aims of this study are (a) to describe the status of persons with cancer pain when assessed ecologically, (b) to analyze the utility of clinical alarms integrated into the app, and (c) to test the feasibility of implementing an app for daily oncological pain monitoring. Methods: in this feasibility study, 21 patients (mean age = 56.95 years, SD = 10.53, 81.0% men) responded to an app-based evaluation of physical status (baseline and breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP)) and mental health variables (fatigue, mood, and coping) daily during 30 days. Results: cancer pain characterization with the app was similar to data from the literature using retrospective assessments in terms of BTcP duration and perceived medication effectiveness. However, BTcP was less frequent when evaluated ecologically. Pain, fatigue, and mood were comparable in the morning and evening. Passive coping strategies were the most employed daily. Clinical alarms appear to be useful to detect and address adverse events. App implementation was feasible and acceptable. Conclusion: apps reduce recall bias and facilitate a rapid response to adverse events in oncological care. Future efforts should be addressed to integrate EMA and ecological momentary interventions to facilitate pain self-management via apps.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721429,Adaptive symptom monitoring using hidden markov models–an application in ecological momentary assessment,2020.0,1,1,,,,,,"WJ Hulme, GP Martin, M Sperrin…",,,ieeexplore.ieee.org,,"Abstract:
Wearable and mobile technology provides new opportunities to manage health conditions remotely and unobtrusively. For example, healthcare providers can repeatedly sample a person's condition to monitor progression of symptoms and intervene if necessary. There is usually a utility-tolerability trade-off between collecting information at sufficient frequencies and quantities to be useful, and over-burdening the user or the underlying technology, particularly when active input is required from the user. Selecting the next sampling time adaptively using previous responses, so that people are only sampled at high frequency when necessary, can help to manage this trade-off. We present a novel approach to adaptive sampling using clustered continuous-time hidden Markov models. The model predicts, at any given sampling time, the probability of moving to an `alert' state, and the next sample time is scheduled when this probability has exceeded a given threshold. The clusters, each representing a distinct sub-model, allow heterogeneity in states and state transitions. The work is illustrated using longitudinal mental-health symptom data in 49 people collected using ClinTouch, a mobile app designed to monitor people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Using these data, we show how the adaptive sampling scheme behaves under different model parameters and risk thresholds, and how the average sampling can be substantially reduced whilst maintaining a high sampling frequency during high-risk periods.","",,"",,

Background:
People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors.


Objective:
This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information.


Methods:
A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges.


Results:
Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03).


Conclusions:
Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

Background:
People with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses often lack access to evidence-based interventions, particularly interventions that target meaningful recovery outcomes such as social functioning and quality of life. Mobile technologies, including smartphone apps, have the potential to provide scalable support that places elements of evidence-based interventions at the palm of patients’ hands.


Objective:
We aim to develop a smartphone app—called Motivation and Skills Support—to provide targeted social goal support (eg, making new friends and improving existing relationships) for people with schizophrenia enrolled in a stand-alone open trial.


Methods:
In this paper, we presented preliminary outcomes of 31 participants who used the Motivation and Skills Support app for 8 weeks, including social functioning pre- to postintervention, and momentary reports of treatment targets (eg, social motivation and appraisals) during the intervention.


Results:
The findings suggest that the intervention improved self-reported social functioning from baseline to treatment termination, particularly in female participants. Gains were not maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, increased social functioning was predicted by momentary reports of social appraisals, including perceived social competence and the extent to which social interactions were worth the effort.


Conclusions:
The implications of these findings and future directions for addressing social functioning in schizophrenia using mobile technology have been discussed.

•

CCRF patients gain insights from personalized (network) feedback.

•

Abstract
Introduction

Chronic cancer-related fatigue (CCRF) is a complex multidimensional problem warranting person-centered care. Providing patients and therapists personalized feedback based on network analysis applied to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data could facilitate case conceptualization in psycho-oncological care. The aim was to explore patients' and therapists' experiences of using an EMA app and personalized feedback based on network theory to aid case conceptualization in psycho-oncological care.

Methods

A n = 5 proof-of-concept study was implemented in routine psycho-oncological care. We purposively selected adult cancer patients suffering from severe CCRF who were on the waitlist for psycho-oncological care. During a 3-week period participants filled out the EMA app Energy InSight (fatigue, mood, activity, responding, and context) five times a day. Participants received a descriptive and network feedback report, which they reflected upon during the first therapy sessions. Thematic analysis was used to analyze user experiences.

Results

Patients experienced that filling out the Energy InSight app, as well as receiving descriptive and network-based personalized feedback provided them with insight into their CCRF. Although therapists experienced the discussion of network feedback as challenging, it facilitated the case conceptualization.

Discussion

Using EMA during waitlist for psychological care seemed feasible. Patients experienced beneficial effects from filling out the EMA app and talking over the personalized feedback reports, which in turn aided case conceptualization and personalized care. Based on this evaluation, an improved version of the Energy InSight app and a therapist training for providing network feedback is developed for implementation in psycho-oncological care.","",,"",,

Abstract

The number of college students who need mental health treatment outpaces the resources available to counseling centers to provide these needed services, presenting a need for low-cost, scalable interventions for college populations. We conducted a pilot implementation-effectiveness trial of a scalable treatment package that consisted of a single (telehealth) workshop plus a companion app that provided ecological momentary intervention. Participants (n = 177) received a workshop provided by counseling center staff and trainees. We were interested in (1) engagement with the app, (2) acceptability of the treatment package, and (3) initial effectiveness of the treatment package. Regarding engagement with the app, we found that participants preferred two reminder prompts per day and identified two key breakpoints when engagement declined significantly: at day 15, when just over half of the sample practiced a skill on the app at least once during the day and at day 41, when just over one third of people practiced a skill on the app each day. Regarding acceptability of the treatment package, students generally reported positive attitudes about the single-session workshop and app, but also noted that the content and assessments in the app needed to be more dynamic to improve how engaging it is. Regarding effectiveness, we found that about 75% of the sample experienced a significant reduction in negative affect from pre- to post-ecological momentary intervention. Moreover, there were significant pre- to post-study decreases in experiential avoidance and symptoms of anxiety and depression and increases in self-efficacy for managing negative emotions. The results of this study are promising in terms of providing initial support for this novel treatment package and provide useful information for researchers planning to develop and test similar interventions.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721448,"Experience sampling and programmed intervention method and system for planning, authoring, and deploying mobile health interventions: design and case …",2021.0,1,1,,,,,,"BCR Cunha, KRDH Rodrigues, I Zaine…",,,jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Health professionals initiating mobile health (mHealth) interventions may choose to adapt apps designed for other activities (eg, peer-to-peer communication) or to employ purpose-built apps specialized in the required intervention, or to exploit apps based on methods such as the experience sampling method (ESM). An alternative approach for professionals would be to create their own apps. While ESM-based methods offer important guidance, current systems do not expose their design at a level that promotes replicating, specializing, or extending their contributions. Thus, a twofold solution is required: a method that directs specialists in planning intervention programs themselves, and a model that guides specialists in adopting existing solutions and advises software developers on building new ones.


Objective:
The main objectives of this study are to design the Experience Sampling and Programmed Intervention Method (ESPIM), formulated toward supporting specialists in deploying mHealth interventions, and the ESPIM model, which guides health specialists in adopting existing solutions and advises software developers on how to build new ones. Another goal is to conceive and implement a software platform allowing specialists to be users who actually plan, create, and deploy interventions (ESPIM system).


Methods:
We conducted the design and evaluation of the ESPIM method and model alongside a software system comprising integrated web and mobile apps. A participatory design approach with stakeholders included early software prototype, predesign interviews with 12 health specialists, iterative design sustained by the software as an instance of the method’s conceptual model, support to 8 real case studies, and postdesign interviews.


Results:
The ESPIM comprises (1) a list of requirements for mHealth experience sampling and intervention-based methods and systems, (2) a 4-dimension planning framework, (3) a 7-step-based process, and (4) an ontology-based conceptual model. The ESPIM system encompasses web and mobile apps. Eight long-term case studies, involving professionals in psychology, gerontology, computer science, speech therapy, and occupational therapy, show that the method allowed specialists to be actual users who plan, create, and deploy interventions via the associated system. Specialists’ target users were parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, older persons, graduate and undergraduate students, children (age 8-12), and caregivers of older persons. The specialists reported being able to create and conduct their own studies without modifying their original design. A qualitative evaluation of the ontology-based conceptual model showed its compliance to the functional requirements elicited.


Conclusions:
The ESPIM method succeeds in supporting specialists in planning, authoring, and deploying mobile-based intervention programs when employed via a software system designed and implemented according to its conceptual model. The ESPIM ontology–based conceptual model exposes the design of systems involving active or passive sampling interventions. Such exposure supports the evaluation, implementation, adaptation, or extension of new or existing systems.

Background:
An extraordinary increase in mobile phone ownership has revolutionized the opportunities to use mobile health approaches in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMAI) uses mobile technology to gather data and deliver timely, personalized behavior change interventions in an individual’s natural setting. To our knowledge, there have been no previous trials of EMAI in sub-Saharan Africa.


Objective:
To advance the evidence base for mobile health (mHealth) interventions in LMICs, we conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility of EMAI and establish estimates of the potential effect of EMAI on a range of health-related behaviors in Rakai, Uganda.


Methods:
This prospective, parallel-group, randomized pilot trial compared health behaviors between adult participants submitting ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data and receiving behaviorally responsive interventional health messaging (EMAI) with those submitting EMA data alone. Using a fully automated mobile phone app, participants submitted daily reports on 5 different health behaviors (fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, and condomless sex with a non–long-term partner) during a 30-day period before randomization (P1). Participants were then block randomized to the control arm, continuing EMA reporting through exit, or the intervention arm, EMA reporting and behavioral health messaging receipt. Participants exited after 90 days of follow-up, divided into study periods 2 (P2: randomization + 29 days) and 3 (P3: 30 days postrandomization to exit). We used descriptive statistics to assess the feasibility of EMAI through the completeness of data and differences in reported behaviors between periods and study arms.


Results:
The study included 48 participants (24 per arm; 23/48, 48% women; median age 31 years). EMA data collection was feasible, with 85.5% (3777/4418) of the combined days reporting behavioral data. There was a decrease in the mean proportion of days when alcohol was consumed in both arms over time (control: P1, 9.6% of days to P2, 4.3% of days; intervention: P1, 7.2% of days to P3, 2.4% of days). Decreases in sex with a non–long-term partner without a condom were also reported in both arms (P1 to P3 control: 1.9% of days to 1% of days; intervention: 6.6% of days to 1.3% of days). An increase in vegetable consumption was found in the intervention (vegetable: 65.6% of days to 76.6% of days) but not in the control arm. Between arms, there was a significant difference in the change in reported vegetable consumption between P1 and P3 (control: 8% decrease in the mean proportion of days vegetables consumed; intervention: 11.1% increase; P=.01).


Conclusions:
Preliminary estimates suggest that EMAI may be a promising strategy for promoting behavior change across a range of behaviors. Larger trials examining the effectiveness of EMAI in LMICs are warranted.

An Introduction to Smartphone Possibilities

Among other things, human change depends on self-awareness and self-reflection. But the pace and distractions of modern life often crowd out self-reflection. Technology--especially mobile technology--has made it easy to fill our downtime with various distractions, limiting our capacity for awareness and even empathy (Konrath, O'Brien & Hsing, 2011). Remarkable tools for modern life, smartphones seem to be adding to the noise and frenetic pace of our lives. But can smartphones also be part of the solution to the challenges of modern life? Can the smartphone contribute to human flourishing and the common good? Can the smartphone be redeemed? These are important questions because smartphones seem here to stay.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans now own smartphones and 90% of the time their devices are in the same room with them (Dey et al., 2011). Smartphones are increasingly being viewed as an extension of the self. It's no wonder that our students, like many of us, feel uneasy when separated from their phones. MIT professor Sherry Turkle (2015) recently noted, ""Our phones are not accessories, but psychologically potent devices that change not just what we do but who we are."" Social scientists and technologists alike have suggested that smartphones will continue to expand our senses and capacities in an integrated, social and self-evolving manner. In one sense, smartphones are making superheroes of us all. We can simultaneously take a walk in the park, track our steps, connect with our spouse across town and business associates across the world--a feat that would have seemed superhuman less than 25 years ago. This idea of being mobile and in multiple places, at the same time, was reserved for Superman less than 25 years ago. On the other hand, as noted above, there are valid concerns about the way smartphones may be shaping us. Given the role technology and smartphones play and will play in shaping us and our interactions, how might smartphones be used well? What are the implications for understanding and caring for our students, clients and underserved community members?","",,"",,
rayyan-28721474,"Feasibility, acceptability, and design of a mobile ecological momentary assessment for high-risk men who have sex with men in Hanoi, Vietnam: qualitative …",2022.0,1,1,,,,,,"K Trang, LX Le, CA Brown, MQ To…",,,formative.jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at a disproportionate risk for HIV infection and common mental disorders worldwide. In the context of HIV, common mental disorders are important and are frequent drivers of suboptimal prevention and treatment outcomes. Mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), or the repeated sampling of people’s behaviors and psychological states in their daily lives using mobile phones, can clarify the triggers and HIV-related sequelae of depressive-anxious symptoms and contribute toward the design of ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) that cater to the contextually varying needs of individuals to optimize prevention and treatment outcomes.


Objective:
This study aims to characterize the feasibility and acceptability of mobile EMA among high-risk MSM in Hanoi, Vietnam. It aims to evaluate the perceived relevance, usability, and concerns of this group with regard to the content and delivery of mobile EMA and the potential of leveraging such platforms in the future to deliver EMIs.


Methods:
Between January and April 2018, a total of 46 participants were recruited. The participants completed 6 to 8 mobile EMA surveys daily for 7 days. Surveys occurred once upon waking, 4 to 6 times throughout the day, and once before sleeping. All surveys queried participants’ perceived safety, social interactions, psychological state, and mental health symptoms. The morning survey further queried on sleep and medication use within the past 24 hours, whereas the night survey queried on sexual activity and substance use and allowed participants to share an audio recording of a stressful experience they had that day. At the end of the week, participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the app.


Results:
Participants completed an average of 21.7 (SD 12.7) prompts over the 7-day period. Excluding nonresponders, the average compliance rate was 61.8% (SD 26.6%). A thematic analysis of qualitative interviews suggested an overall positive reception of the app and 5 recurring themes, which were centered on the relevance of psychological and behavioral items to daily experiences (eg, mental health symptoms and audio recording), benefits of using the app (eg, increased self-understanding), worries and concerns (eg, privacy), usability (eg, confusion about the interface), and recommendations for future design (eg, integrating more open-ended questions).


Conclusions:
Mobile EMA is feasible and acceptable among young MSM in Vietnam; however, more research is needed to adapt EMA protocols to this context and enhance compliance. Most participants eagerly provided information about their mental health status and daily activities. As several participants looked toward the app for further mental health and psychosocial support, EMIs have the potential to reduce HIV and mental health comorbidity among MSM.

rayyan-28721477,"Pilot Testing in the Wild: Feasibility, Acceptability, Usage Patterns, and Efficacy of an Integrated Web and Smartphone Platform for Bipolar II Disorder",2022.0,1,1,,,,,,"K Fletcher, K Lindblom, E Seabrook…",,,formative.jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Bipolar II disorder (BD-II) is associated with significant burden, disability, and mortality; however, there continues to be a dearth of evidence-based psychological interventions for this condition. Technology-mediated interventions incorporating self-management have untapped potential to help meet this need as an adjunct to usual clinical care.


Objective:
The objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of a novel intervention for BD-II (Tailored Recovery-oriented Intervention for Bipolar II Experiences; TRIBE), in which mindfulness-based psychological content is delivered via an integrated web and smartphone platform. The focus of the study is evaluation of the dynamic use patterns emerging from ecological momentary assessment and intervention to assist the real-world application of mindfulness skills learned from web-delivered modules.


Methods:
An open trial design using pretest and posttest assessments with nested qualitative evaluation was used. Individuals (aged 18-65 years) with a diagnosis of BD-II were recruited worldwide and invited to use a prototype of the TRIBE intervention over a 3-week period. Data were collected via web-based questionnaires and phone interviews at baseline and 3-week follow-up.


Results:
A total of 25 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments. Adherence rates (daily app use) were 65.6% across the 3-week study, with up to 88% (22/25) of participants using the app synergistically alongside the web-based program. Despite technical challenges with the prototype intervention (from user, hardware, and software standpoints), acceptability was adequate, and most participants rated the intervention positively in terms of concept (companion app with website: 19/25, 76%), content (19/25, 76%), and credibility and utility in supporting their management of bipolar disorder (17/25, 68%). Evaluation using behavioral archetypes identified important use pathways and a provisional model to inform platform refinement. As hypothesized, depression scores significantly decreased after the intervention (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale baseline mean 8.60, SD 6.86, vs follow-up mean 6.16, SD 5.11; t24=2.63; P=.01; Cohen d=0.53, 95% CI 0.52-4.36).


Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that TRIBE is feasible and represents an appropriate and acceptable self-management program for patients with BD-II. Preliminary efficacy results are promising and support full development of TRIBE informed by the present behavioral archetype analysis. Modifications suggested by the pilot study include increasing the duration of the intervention and increasing technical support.

Importance  Targeting low self-esteem in youth exposed to childhood adversity is a promising strategy for preventing adult mental disorders. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) allow for the delivery of youth-friendly, adaptive interventions for improving self-esteem, but robust trial-based evidence is pending.

Objective  To examine the efficacy of SELFIE, a novel transdiagnostic, blended EMI for improving self-esteem plus care as usual (CAU) compared with CAU only.

Design, Setting, and Participants  This was a 2-arm, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted from December 2018 to December 2022. The study took place at Dutch secondary mental health services and within the general population and included youth (aged 12-26 years) with low self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale [RSES] <26) exposed to childhood adversity.

Interventions  A novel blended EMI (3 face-to-face sessions, email contacts, app-based, adaptive EMI) plus CAU or CAU only.

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was RSES self-esteem at postintervention and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included positive and negative self-esteem, schematic self-beliefs, momentary self-esteem and affect, general psychopathology, quality of life, observer-rated symptoms, and functioning.

Results  A total of 174 participants (mean [SD] age, 20.7 [3.1] years; 154 female [89%]) were included in the intention-to-treat sample, who were primarily exposed to childhood emotional abuse or neglect, verbal or indirect bullying, and/or parental conflict. At postintervention, 153 participants (87.9%) and, at follow-up, 140 participants (80.5%), provided primary outcome data. RSES self-esteem was, on average, higher in the experimental condition (blended EMI + CAU) than in the control condition (CAU) across both postintervention and follow-up as a primary outcome (B = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.14-3.50; P < .001; Cohen d-type effect size [hereafter, Cohen d] = 0.54). Small to moderate effect sizes were observed suggestive of beneficial effects on positive (B = 3.85; 95% CI, 1.83-5.88; P < .001; Cohen d = 0.53) and negative (B = −3.78; 95% CI, −6.59 to −0.98; P = .008; Cohen d = −0.38) self-esteem, positive (B = 1.58; 95% CI, 0.41-2.75; P = .008; Cohen d = 0.38) and negative (B = −1.71; 95% CI, −2.93 to −0.48; P = .006; Cohen d = −0.39) schematic self-beliefs, momentary self-esteem (B = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.01-0.57; P = .04; Cohen d = 0.24), momentary positive affect (B = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.01-0.45; P = .04; Cohen d = 0.20), momentary negative affect (B = −0.33; 95% CI, −0.59 to −0.03, P = .01, Cohen d = −0.27), general psychopathology (B = −17.62; 95% CI, −33.03 to −2.21; P = .03; Cohen d = −0.34), and quality of life (B = 1.16; 95% CI, 0.18-2.13; P = .02; Cohen d = 0.33) across postintervention and follow-up. No beneficial effects on symptoms and functioning were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance  A transdiagnostic, blended EMI demonstrated efficacy on the primary outcome of self-esteem and signaled beneficial effects on several secondary outcomes. Further work should focus on implementing this novel EMI in routine public mental health provision.

•

MEMI and SM enhanced SAD, worry, repetitive thinking, and trait mindfulness.

•

Depression severity was reduced in the MEMI but not the SM arm.

•

Abstract

Despite their proliferation, limited knowledge exists regarding possible benefits of brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Propositions that MEMIs could alleviate SAD symptoms and related clinical outcomes remain untested. This trial evaluated a 14-day MEMI for SAD. Participants with self-reported SAD were randomized to MEMI (n = 96) or self-monitoring app (SM; n = 95). Whereas MEMI instructed mindfulness exercises, SM prompted only self-monitoring five times daily for 14 days. Participants completed state-level self-reports of depression, anxiety, and mindfulness pre-post-mindfulness practice and SAD symptoms, worry, depression severity, repetitive negative thinking, and trait mindfulness at pre-randomization, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU). Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted. The MEMI yielded statistically significantly larger improvements in momentary depression, anxiety, and mindfulness (Cohen's d = −0.10–0.11). Although no between-group effects emerged in alleviating SAD fear and avoidance, excessive worry, depression severity, repetitive negative thinking, and trait mindfulness (−0.13–0.15), within-group effects were significantly small-to-large from pre-post and pre-1MFU (−4.62–0.67). A significant reduction in depression severity occurred in MEMI (−0.63–−0.60) but not SM (−0.31–−0.29). Brief MEMI and SM yielded nondifferent sustained effects on SAD, comorbid symptoms, and risk factors, highlighting its potential value within stepped-care delivery settings.","",,"",,

rayyan-28721492,"Examination of nutrition monitoring through ecological momentary assessment during an internet-based, self-directed weight loss intervention",2019.0,1,1,,,,,,C Solar,,,search.proquest.com,,"Internet and mobile health (mHealth) based interventions are promising potential options
for increasing access to weight loss treatment for the general public (Payne et al., 2015). Many
health-related internet and mobile phone applications are commercially available, free, and
include features for nutrition self-monitoring which is a vitally important self-management
strategy for weight loss. However, adherence to nutrition self-monitoring for internet and
mHealth interventions is poor and research examining the mechanisms of nutrition self-
monitoring behavior is limited (Lieffers & Hanning, 2012). The purpose of the present study is
to improve understanding of self-monitoring behavior by examining the phenomenological
experience of mobile application self-monitoring through ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) during the first two weeks of an internet-based, self-directed weight loss intervention.
Fifty-one participants (19.6% male, 43.1% non-white) were enrolled in a 16-week, self-
directed, online weight loss intervention. Original methods included the use of two different
nutrition monitoring applications; however, due to a technological failure only one application
(MyFitnessPal) was utilized. Participants completed ecological momentary assessments of
nutrition self-monitoring experiences during the first two weeks of the intervention and
continued to use online materials and the nutrition monitoring mobile application for the
remaining 14 weeks. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was utilized to examine within-subject
differences in perceptions and experiences between instances of completed nutrition monitoring
and instances of missed nutrition monitoring. The relationships between aggregated participant
experiences during the EMA period and nutrition self-monitoring over 16 weeks as well as
weight outcomes were examined using correlational analyses.
Compliance for EMA event-continent responding and signaled random prompt
responding was 58% and 70%, respectively. EMA responses immediately following a nutrition
monitoring entry demonstrated increased participant perceptions of goal consistency, diet
success, diet maintenance, less emotional eating, less monitoring burden, and greater negative
affect as compared to random prompt responses related to a missed nutrition monitoring entry.
Participants monitored nutrition for an average of 48.7 days and nutrition monitoring frequency
was associated with EMA compliance as well as participant perceptions of goal consistency, diet
success, and diet maintenance during the first 14 days. Frequency of nutrition monitoring and
perceptions of diet success during EMA were associated with weight change in both completer-
only analyses and intent-to-treat. The results of this study suggest that early nutrition
monitoring experiences such as the perception of goal consistency and diet success are important
factors for engagement in weight loss treatment. However, further research on monitoring
experiences with larger and more diverse samples is needed to determine how these factors
might be used to inform future assessment and intervention.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721495,A smartphone application of “Family Connections” to increase the use of skills and improve psychological symptoms in relatives of people with borderline …,2022.0,1,1,,,,,,"I Fernández-Felipe, V Guillén, D Castilla…",,,Elsevier,,"Abstract
Background

The literature reveals that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is an important public mental health problem that affects both the patients and their families. Moreover, studies indicate a high prevalence of psychological symptoms and burden in relatives of people with BPD. Therefore, it is necessary to develop useful and accessible interventions specifically addressed to the caregivers. Smartphone interventions with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) offer several potential advantages in this regard. The aims of our study are to test the effectiveness of a combined intervention supported by a smartphone app versus the same intervention supported by a paper-based manual, studying the feasibility and acceptance of both conditions and evaluating the perceptions and opinions of families about both interventions. This paper contains the study protocol.

Method

The design of this study protocol is a randomized controlled trial. A minimum of 116 relatives will be randomly assigned to two conditions: Treatment as usual (TAU) (N = 58) or Treatment as usual + EMI (TAU+EMI) (N = 58), with TAU being the Family Connection program. The primary outcome will be the Burden Assessment Scale. Secondary outcomes will include psychological symptoms, mastery and empowerment, and resilience. Outcomes will be assessed from pre-treatment to post-treatment (3 months). Statistical analyses will be performed using Student's t-tests, mixed models (ANCOVA) and intention-to-treat analysis.

Discussion

The results of this study will provide a basis for future EMA- and EMI-based application interventions for family members of people with BPD and family members of people with other mental disorders who could benefit from the skills taught.","",,"",,

Objectives: 

The HEAR-aware project targets adults ≥50 years who were recently diagnosed with hearing loss and declined hearing aids, but were open for support via a smartphone app on different target behaviors (TBs). The HEAR-aware app, based on Ecological Momentary Assessment and Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMA, EMI), contains educational materials (“snippets”) tailored partly to the user’s experienced listening situations. The app aims to increase adults’ TB-specific readiness to take action on hearing problems. The present study focused on examining feasibility regarding three novel aspects: (1) the app’s acceptability, mainly regarding its EMA and EMI elements (compliance, usability, usefulness, satisfaction), (2) psychometric properties of 10 new TB-specific stages-of-change (SoC) measures (test–retest reliability, construct validity), and (3) the potential of tailoring snippets on a person’s SoC.

Design: 

A nonrandomized intervention study including four measurements with 2-week intervals (T0–T3). (1) The intervention period lasted 4 weeks. App usage data were collected throughout (T1–T3). Usability, usefulness, and satisfaction were measured at T3 (n = 26). (2) Reliability concerned T0 and T1 data, in between which no intervention occurred. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated (n = 29). Construct validity was examined by calculating correlations between the different TB-specific scales (at T0), and also between each of them and self-reported hearing disability (n = 29). (3) Person-tailoring by SoC was examined using T0 and T1 data. Linear mixed models were applied to test whether users rated snippets corresponding to their SoC as more interesting and useful than noncorresponding snippets (n = 25).

Results: 

(1) The percentage of participants that complied with the intended usage varied across the five predefined compliance criteria (lowest: 8%; highest: 85%). Median snippet satisfaction scores were reasonably positive (3.5 to 4.0 of 5). Usability was good (System Usability Score, mean = 72.4, SD = 14.3) and usefulness satisfactory (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, mean = 4.4, SD = 1.4), but showed large variance. (2) The 10 TB-specific scales showed fair-to-excellent reliabilities (range ICCs = 0.51 to 0.80). Correlations between the TB-specific scales ranged between −0.17 (p > 0.05) and 0.74 (p < 0.001), supporting only partly overlap between their underlying constructs. Only the correlation between TB-specific readiness for hearing aid uptake and self-reported hearing disability was significant. (3) Correspondence of a snippet’s SoC with the person’s SoC significantly related to “interesting” ratings (p = 0.006). Unexpectedly, for snippets with a lower SoC than the participant’s, further deviation of the snippet’s SoC from the participant’s SoC, increased the participant’s interest in the snippet. The relationship with “usefulness” was borderline significant.

Conclusions: 

(1) Overall usability, usefulness, and satisfaction scores indicated sufficient app acceptability. The high variance and fairly low compliance showed room for improving the app’s EMA/EMI parts for part of the participants. (2) The 10 new TB-specific SoC measures showed sufficient reliability, supporting that they measured different types of readiness to take action on hearing problems (construct validity). (3) The unexpected findings regarding tailoring educational app materials to individuals’ SoC deserve further study.","",,"",,

Abstract

Body dissatisfaction rates continue to remain high, and the consequences remain dire, especially among young women. Traditional media literacy interventions have found success in addressing body image-related constructs, though they are limited in their reach and are often quickly outdated. This study was designed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a media literacy intervention via ecological momentary intervention. This pilot study tested a media literacy intervention delivered via a smartphone app designed to disrupt the connection between media use and body dissatisfaction. Thirty-seven undergraduate women (Mage = 21.17; SD = 2.20) received a 15-day media literacy intervention through a smartphone application. The primary outcomes were completion rates, retention rates, percentage of data points lost to technological errors, and participant feedback. The secondary outcome was change in body dissatisfaction. The retention and percentage of data points lost to technological errors, alongside participants' ratings, indicated that this intervention is feasible and acceptable. Several targets were identified to increase participant acceptance and potential efficacy of the intervention. Trait body dissatisfaction decreased, though not significantly, following the intervention. State body image satisfaction improved significantly from the first day to the last day of engagement with the app. Overall, the intervention was deemed feasible and acceptable, opening the door for future research in which the intervention and its delivery system are improved, and its efficacy is reexamined. Future digital media literacy interventions should focus on building a user-centered app, further reducing participant burden, and testing efficacy in large and diverse samples.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721506,An Ecological Mobile Momentary Intervention to Support Dynamic Goal Pursuit: Feasibility and Acceptability Study,2024.0,1,1,,,,,,"C O'Driscoll, A Singh, I Chichua, J Clodic…",,,formative.jmir.org,,"Abstract

Background:
Individuals can experience difficulties pursuing their goals amid multiple competing priorities in their environment. Effective goal dynamics require flexible and generalizable pursuit skills. Supporting successful goal pursuit requires a perpetually adapting intervention responsive to internal states.


Objective:
The purpose of this study was to (1) develop a flexible intervention that can adapt to an individual’s changing short to medium-term goals and be applied to their daily life and (2) examine the feasibility and acceptability of the just-in-time adaptive intervention for goal pursuit.


Methods:
This study involved 3 iterations to test and systematically enhance all aspects of the intervention. During the pilot phase, 73 participants engaged in an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) over 1 month. After week 1, they attended an intervention training session and received just-in-time intervention prompts during the following 3 weeks. The training employed the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) framework for goal setting, along with mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII). Subsequent prompts, triggered by variability in goal pursuit, guided the participants to engage in MCII in relation to their current goal. We evaluated feasibility and acceptability, efficacy, and individual change processes by combining intensive (single-case experimental design) and extensive methods.


Results:
The results suggest that the digital intervention was feasible and acceptable to participants. Compliance with the intervention was high (n=63, 86%). The participants endorsed high acceptability ratings relating to both the study procedures and the intervention. All participants (N=73, 100%) demonstrated significant improvements in goal pursuit with an average difference of 0.495 units in the outcome (P<.001). The results of the dynamic network modeling suggest that self-monitoring behavior (EMA) and implementing the MCII strategy may aid in goal reprioritization, where goal pursuit itself is a driver of further goal pursuit.


Conclusions:
This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a just-in-time adaptive intervention among a nonclinical adult sample. This intervention used self-monitoring of behavior, the COM-B framework, and MCII strategies to improve dynamic goal pursuit. It was delivered via an Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) procedure. Future research should consider the utility of this approach as an additional intervention element within psychological interventions to improve goal pursuit. Sustaining goal pursuit throughout interventions is central to their effectiveness and warrants further evaluation.

Background:
Theories propose that brief, mobile, self-guided mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (MEMIs) could enhance emotion regulation (ER) and self-compassion. Such changes are posited to be mechanisms of change. However, rigorous tests of these theories have not been conducted.


Objective:
In this assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, we aimed to test these theories in social anxiety disorder (SAD).


Methods:
Participants with SAD (defined as having a prerandomization cut-off score ≥20 on the Social Phobia Inventory self-report) were randomized to a 14-day fully self-guided MEMI (96/191, 50.3%) or self-monitoring app (95/191, 49.7%) arm. They completed web-based self-reports of 6 clinical outcome measures at prerandomization, 15-day postintervention (administered the day after the intervention ended), and 1-month follow-up time points. ER and self-compassion were assessed at preintervention and 7-day midintervention time points. Multilevel modeling determined the efficacy of MEMI on ER and self-compassion domains from pretrial to midintervention time points. Bootstrapped parallel multilevel mediation analysis examined the mediating role of pretrial to midintervention ER and self-compassion domains on the efficacy of MEMI on 6 clinical outcomes.


Results:
Participants demonstrated strong compliance, with 78% (149/191) engaging in at least 80% of the MEMI and self-monitoring prompts. MEMI was more efficacious than the self-monitoring app in decreasing ER goal–directed behavior difficulties (between-group Cohen d=−0.24) and lack of emotional clarity (Cohen d=0.16) and increasing self-compassion social connectedness (Cohen d=0.19), nonidentification with emotions (Cohen d=0.16), and self-kindness (Cohen d=0.19) from pretrial to midintervention time points. The within-group effect sizes from pretrial to midintervention were larger in the MEMI arm than in the self-monitoring app arm (ER goal–directed behavior difficulties: Cohen d=−0.73 vs −0.29, lack of emotional clarity: Cohen d=−0.39 vs −0.21, self-compassion domains of social connectedness: Cohen d=0.45 vs 0.19, nonidentification with emotions: Cohen d=0.63 vs 0.48, and self-kindness: Cohen d=0.36 vs 0.10). Self-monitoring, but not MEMI, alleviated ER emotional awareness issues (between-group Cohen d=0.11 and within-group: Cohen d=−0.29 vs −0.13) and reduced self-compassion acknowledging shared human struggles (between-group Cohen d=0.26 and within-group: Cohen d=−0.23 vs 0.13). No ER and self-compassion domains were mediators of the effect of MEMI on SAD symptoms (P=.07-<.99), generalized anxiety symptoms (P=.16-.98), depression severity (P=.20-.94), repetitive negative thinking (P=.12-.96), and trait mindfulness (P=.18-.99) from pretrial to postintervention time points. Similar nonsignificant mediation effects emerged for all of these clinical outcomes from pretrial to 1-month follow-up time points (P=.11-.98).


Conclusions:
Brief, fully self-guided, mobile MEMIs efficaciously increased specific self-compassion domains and decreased ER difficulties associated with goal pursuit and clarity of emotions from pretrial to midintervention time points. Higher-intensity MEMIs may be required to pinpoint the specific change mechanisms in ER and self-compassion domains of SAD.

Background:
The utility of brief mindfulness ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) to improve empathy and theory-of-mind has been underinvestigated, particularly in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).


Objective:
In this randomized controlled trial, we aimed to examine the efficacy of a 14-day, fully self-guided, mindfulness EMI on the empathy and theory-of-mind domains for GAD.


Methods:
Adults (aged ≥18 y) diagnosed with GAD were randomized to a mindfulness EMI (68/110, 61.8%) or self-monitoring app (42/110, 38.2%) arm. They completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report empathy measure and theory-of-mind test (Bell-Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task) at prerandomization, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU) time points. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted with the intent-to-treat principle to determine prerandomization to postintervention (pre-post intervention) and prerandomization to 1MFU (pre-1MFU) changes, comparing the mindfulness EMI to self-monitoring.


Results:
Observed effects were generally stronger from pre-1MFU than from pre-post intervention time points. From pre-post intervention time points, the mindfulness EMI was more efficacious than the self-monitoring app on fantasy (the ability to imagine being in others’ shoes; between-intervention effect size: Cohen d=0.26, P=.007; within-intervention effect size: Cohen d=0.22, P=.02 for the mindfulness EMI and Cohen d=−0.16, P=.10 for the self-monitoring app). From pre-1MFU time points, the mindfulness EMI, but not the self-monitoring app, improved theory-of-mind (a window into others’ thoughts and intentions through abstract, propositional knowledge about their mental states, encompassing the ability to decipher social cues) and the fantasy, personal distress (stress when witnessing others’ negative experiences), and perspective-taking (understanding others’ perspective) empathy domains. The effect sizes were small to moderate (Cohen d=0.15-0.36; P<.001 to P=.01) for significant between-intervention effects from pre-1MFU time points. Furthermore, the within-intervention effect sizes for these significant outcomes were stronger for the mindfulness EMI (Cohen d=0.30-0.43; P<.001 to P=.03) than the self-monitoring app (Cohen d=−0.12 to 0.21; P=.001 to P>.99) from pre-1MFU time points. No between-intervention and within-intervention effects on empathic concern (feeling affection, compassion, and care when observing others in distress, primarily attending to their emotional well-being) were observed from pre-post intervention and pre-1MFU time points.


Conclusions:
The brief mindfulness EMI improved specific domains of empathy (eg, fantasy, personal distress, and perspective-taking) and theory-of-mind with small to moderate effect sizes in persons with GAD. Higher-intensity, self-guided or coach-facilitated, multicomponent mindfulness EMIs targeting the optimization of social relationships are likely necessary to improve the empathic concern domain in this population.

rayyan-28721520,Combined Motivational Interviewing and Ecological Momentary Intervention to Reduce Hazardous Alcohol Use Among Sexual Minority Cisgender Men and …,,1,1,,,,,,"E Nicholson, MLS Kimberly Haney, R Adatorwovor…",,,,,"Abstract

Background: Sexual minority cisgender men and transgender (SMMT) individuals, particularly emerging adults (aged 18-34
years), often report hazardous drinking. Given that alcohol use increases the likelihood of HIV risk behaviors, and HIV
disproportionately affects SMMT individuals, there is a need to test interventions that reduce hazardous alcohol use and subsequent
HIV risk behaviors among this population. Ecological momentary interventions (EMIs), which use mobile phones to deliver risk
reduction messages based on current location and behaviors, can help to address triggers that lead to drinking in real time.

Objective: This study will test an EMI that uses motivational interviewing (MI), smartphone surveys, mobile breathalyzers,
and location tracking to provide real-time messaging that addresses triggers for drinking when SMMT individuals visit locations
associated with hazardous alcohol use. In addition, the intervention will deliver harm reduction messaging if individuals report
engaging in alcohol use.

Methods: We will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial (N=405 HIV-negative SMMT individuals; n=135, 33% per
arm) comparing the following conditions: (1) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption (a smartphone-delivered 4-session
MI intervention), (2) Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption and Environmental Risk (an EMI combining MI with real-time
messaging based on geographic locations that are triggers to drinking), and (3) a smartphone-based alcohol monitoring–only
control group. Breathalyzer results and daily self-reports will be used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes of drinking
days, drinks per drinking day, binge drinking episodes, and HIV risk behaviors. Additional assessments at baseline, 3 months, 6
months, and 9 months will evaluate exploratory long-term outcomes.

Results: The study is part of a 5-year research project funded in August 2022 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism. The first 1.5 years of the study will be dedicated to planning and development activities, including formative research,
app design and testing, and message design and testing. The subsequent 3.5 years will see the study complete participant recruitment,
data collection, analyses, report writing, and dissemination. We expect to complete all study data collection in or before January
2027.

Conclusions: This study will provide novel evidence about the relative efficacy of using a smartphone-delivered MI intervention
and real-time messaging to address triggers for hazardous alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors. The EMI approach, which
incorporates location-based preventive messaging and behavior surveys, may help to better understand the complexity of daily
stressors among SMMT individuals and their impact on hazardous alcohol use and HIV risk behaviors. The tailoring of this
intervention toward SMMT individuals helps to address their underrepresentation in existing alcohol use research and will be
promising for informing where structural alcohol use prevention and treatment interventions are needed to support SMMT
individuals","",,"",,
rayyan-28721521,Evaluating The Effectiveness Of An Ecological Momentary Intervention Targeting Body Checking Behaviors,2016.0,1,1,,,,,,JM Smith,,,bearworks.missouristate.edu,,"Abstract

This study investigated the efficacy of an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) targeting body checking behaviors (weighing, mirror checking, and feeling the body for fat). Body checking has been shown to increase body dissatisfaction and play a role in eating disorders. A digitally based intervention delivered in individuals' naturalistic environments has not yet been explored in the literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to combine ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to capture body checking frequency and an EMI to target body checking. For the current study, 44 female undergraduates with high body checking levels and healthy weight participated in a five-day intervention where they received five messages via their smart phones each day assessing the frequency of body checking. On the final two days of the study, an intervention message was also sent containing cognitive-behavioral strategies for decreasing body checking. Multilevel modeling was used to investigate the relationship between time (within day and across days), body dissatisfaction, and reported body checking. Body checking behaviors increased within each day while decreasing across the five day intervention period. Additionally, analyses of pre to posttest measures found healthy improvements in a number of body image related constructs. These results suggest that targeting body checking behaviors through a brief ecological momentary intervention may be a useful clinical tool.","",,"",,
rayyan-28721524,Treatment condition as a moderator and change in trait mindfulness as a mediator of a brief mindfulness ecological momentary intervention for generalized anxiety …,2024.0,1,1,,,,,,"NH Zainal, MG Newman",,,cambridge.org,,"Background

Theories propose that judgment of and reactivity to inner experiences are mediators of the effect of mindfulness-based interventions on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, no study has tested such theories using brief, mindfulness ecological momentary intervention (MEMI). We thus tested these theories using a 14-day MEMI versus self-monitoring app (SM) control for GAD.

Methods

Participants (N = 110) completed self-reports of trait mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), GAD severity (GAD-Questionnaire-IV), and trait perseverative cognitions (Perseverative Cognitions Questionnaire) at prerandomization, posttreatment, and 1-month follow-up (1MFU). Counterfactual mediation analyses with temporal precedence were conducted.

Results

Improvement in pre–post mindfulness domains (acceptance of emotions, describing feelings accurately, acting with awareness, judgment of inner experience, and reactivity to inner experience) predicted pre-1MFU reduction in GAD severity and pre-1MFU reduction in trait perseverative cognitions from MEMI but not SM. MEMI reduced pre–post reactivity to inner experiences (but not other mindfulness domains) significantly more than SM. Only reduced pre–post reactivity significantly mediated stronger efficacy of MEMI over SM on pre-1MFU reductions in GAD severity (indirect effect: β = −2.970 [−5.034, −0.904], p = .008; b path: β = −3.313 [−6.350, −0.276], p = .033; percentage mediated: 30.5%) and trait perseverative cognitions (indirect effect: β = −0.153 [−0.254, −0.044], p = .008; b path: β = −0.145 [−0.260, −0.030], p = .014; percentage mediated: 42.7%). Other trait mindfulness domains were non-significant mediators.

Conclusions

Reactivity to inner experience might be a mindfulness-based intervention change mechanism and should be targeted to optimize brief MEMIs for GAD.","",,"",,

Background: Many suicide risk factors have been identified, but traditional clinical methods do not allow the accurate
prediction of suicide behaviors. To face this challenge, we developed emma, an app for Ecological Momentary
Assessment/Intervention (EMA/EMI) and prediction of suicide risk in high risk patients.

Objective: We wanted to test the feasibility of implementing this mHealth-based suicide risk assessment and prevention tool and
its impact in subjects at high risk of suicide in real world conditions.

Methods: The EMMA Study is an ongoing longitudinal interventional multicenter trial in which patients at high-risk for suicide
(n=100) use emma for 6 months. During this period, they complete four EMA types (daily, weekly, monthly, spontaneous) and
may use EMI modules. Participants undergo clinical assessment at month 0, 1, 3 and 6 after inclusion.

Results: Among the 43 patients already recruited in the EMMA Study, 14 participants had completed the follow-up. Their data
were analyzed to evaluate emma implementation and impact on suicide risk management. EMA completion rates were extremely
heterogeneous among the 14 participants with a sharp decrease over time. The completion rates of the weekly EMA (25% to
87.5%) were higher than for the daily EMA (0% to 53.3%). Most patients (n=10/14) answered the EMA questionnaires
spontaneously. Similarly, the Safety Plan Modules use was very heterogeneous (2 to 75 times). Specifically, 11 patients used the
Call Module (1 to 29 times), designed by our team to help them to get in touch with healthcare professionals and/or relatives
during a crisis. All patients used the Breathing Space Module and 8 the Emotion Regulation Module (1 to 46 times). The
diversity of patient profiles and use of the EMA and EMI modules proposed by emma was highlighted by three case reports.

Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that it is possible and acceptable to collect longitudinal fine-grained
contextualized data (EMA) and to offer personalized intervention (EMI) in real time to people at high risk of suicide. Patients
have different clinical and digital profiles and needs that require a highly scalable, interactive and customizable app. To become
a complementary tool for suicide prevention, emma should be integrated in the existing emergency procedures. Clinical Trial:

rayyan-28721536,Alleviating the Harm: A Media Literacy Intervention for Body Dissatisfaction Using Ecological Momentary Intervention,2020.0,1,1,,,,,,BL Bennett,,,search.proquest.com,,"Abstract

Objective: Body dissatisfaction rates continue to remain high and the consequences remain dire,
especially among young women. One sociocultural factor found to contribute to body
dissatisfaction is media use. Traditional media literacy interventions have found some success in
decreasing body image-related constructs, though are limited in their reach and are often quickly
outdated. This study developed and examined a media literacy intervention delivered via a
smartphone app designed to help college women disrupt connection between media use and body
dissatisfaction and negative affect.

Method: Participants included 94 University of Hawai‘i students, randomly assigned to the
intervention group, the app-based control group, or the traditional control group. Participants
using the app received 5 prompts per day for 15 days. The app-based control group self-
monitored while the intervention group both self-monitored and received prompts providing
psychoeducation and activities designed to increase media literacy. Assessment measures were
collected at baseline and again 15 days later.

Results: The intervention produced significant improvements in the intervention group compared
to the control group on measures of fatigue. There were also overall reductions over time in
general negative affect, fear, sadness, guilt, hostility, shyness, general positive affect, joviality,
self-assurance, attentiveness, serenity and critical thinking about media messages that were not
specific to condition. Feedback questions gathered at follow-up from the intervention group
showed that participants rated the intervention as acceptable. Additionally, participants endorsed
learning more about the link between the media ideals and body image.
Discussion: This study provides evidence in support of the feasibility of delivering a media
literacy intervention via a smartphone application. Participation in the study found significant
decreases in types of affect, such as general negative affect, general positive affect, and sadness
from baseline to post-intervention. However, there may be potential for greater change. Study
limitations such as power and challenges with the smartphone application are discussed. Future
directions related to the creation of digital interventions are discussed. Overall, participants rated
the intervention as acceptable, opening the door for future research in which the intervention and
its delivery system are improved, and its efficacy is reexamined","",,"",,

Usability is important when evaluating products and providing feedback on improving the system and
its intern functions. Since the use of mobile intervention has grown in health research, the need for
evaluation has increased. This pilot study took place in Kambaland, a rural area of Kenya, where
intimate partner violence (IPV) still is a severe problem.
26 male partners with a high risk of committing IPV completed anger management training sessions
and a following smartphone intervention. The mobile phase included an Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) and Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) with the application movisensXS.
Participants should learn to reflect on their behavior before it comes to violent actions to improve their
relationships. After the intervention, they evaluated the usability of the smartphone app using the
System Usability Scale (SUS) and other context-specific questions. Moreover, reliable participation was
measured by the number of days on which the men took part and the length of participation time.
The men rated the intervention with an average SUS score of 69.69. They participated in EMI 91.50%
of the time and in EMA 91.38% of the time. The men worked on their if-then plans with an average
participation time of 3 minutes and 15 seconds.
The results indicated that the anger management intervention was accepted based on regular
attendance, but the implementation in the app offers room for improvement.","",,"",,

Background: mobile applications (apps) facilitate cancer pain ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and provide more reliable data than retrospective monitoring. The aims of this study are (a) to describe the status of persons with cancer pain when assessed ecologically, (b) to analyze the utility of clinical alarms integrated into the app, and (c) to test the feasibility of implementing an app for daily oncological pain monitoring. Methods: in this feasibility study, 21 patients (mean age = 56.95 years, SD = 10.53, 81.0% men) responded to an app-based evaluation of physical status (baseline and breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP)) and mental health variables (fatigue, mood, and coping) daily during 30 days. Results: cancer pain characterization with the app was similar to data from the literature using retrospective assessments in terms of BTcP duration and perceived medication effectiveness. However, BTcP was less frequent when evaluated ecologically. Pain, fatigue, and mood were comparable in the morning and evening. Passive coping strategies were the most employed daily. Clinical alarms appear to be useful to detect and address adverse events. App implementation was feasible and acceptable. Conclusion: apps reduce recall bias and facilitate a rapid response to adverse events in oncological care. Future efforts should be addressed to integrate EMA and ecological momentary interventions to facilitate pain self-management via apps.","",,"",,

Objective: This study investigated the effectiveness and mediating mechanisms of text messaging-based mindfulness-based interventions for people with distress related to insomnia, pain, or dysregulated eating. Methods: In these trials, 333, 235, and 351 participants were recruited online and randomized to intervention and wait-list control conditions for insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating, respectively. Participants experienced 21 days of intervention through WhatsApp Messenger. Participants completed pre-, post-, 1-month follow-up, and 3-month follow-up self-report questionnaires online. The retention rates at postmeasurements were 83.2% (139/167), 77.1% (91/118), and 72.9% (129/177) for intervention groups of insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating, respectively. Participants' queries were answered by a study technician. Primary outcomes included insomnia severity, presleep arousal, pain intensity, pain acceptance, and eating behaviors. Secondary outcomes included mindfulness, depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and functional impairments. Mindfulness, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, pain catastrophizing, and reactivity to food cues were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. Results: For all 3 studies, the intervention groups showed significant improvement on most outcomes at 1-month follow-up compared to their respective wait-list control groups; some primary outcomes (eg, insomnia, pain, dysregulated eating indicators) and secondary outcomes (eg, depression, anxiety symptoms) were sustained at 3-month follow-up. Medium-to-large effect sizes were found at postassessments in most outcomes in all studies. In the intervention for insomnia, mediation analyses showed that dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep mediated the effect of the intervention on all primary outcomes and most secondary outcomes at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, whereas mindfulness mediated the intervention effect on presleep arousal at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. In the intervention for pain, pain catastrophizing mediated the effect of intervention on pain intensity and functioning at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, whereas mindfulness only mediated the effect of intervention on anxiety and depressive symptoms. In the intervention for dysregulated eating, power of food mediated the effect of intervention on both uncontrolled and emotional eating at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups and mindfulness was found to mediate the effect on depressive symptoms at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Conclusions: These 3 studies converged and provided empirical evidence that mindfulness-based interventions delivered through text messaging are effective in improving distress related to sleep, pain, and dysregulated eating. Text messaging has the potential to be a core intervention modality to improve various common health outcomes for people living a fast-paced lifestyle.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2024-04151-001). Background: Advancements in mobile health technologies and machine learning approaches have expanded the framework of behavioral phenotypes in obesity treatment to explore the dynamics of temporal changes. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of behavioral changes during obesity intervention and identify behavioral phenotypes associated with weight change using a hybrid machine learning approach. Methods: In total, 88 children and adolescents (ages 8-16 years; 62/88, 71% male) with age- and sex-specific BMI >=85th percentile participated in the study. Behavioral phenotypes were identified using a hybrid 2-stage procedure based on the temporal dynamics of adherence to the 5 behavioral goals during the intervention. Functional principal component analysis was used to determine behavioral phenotypes by extracting principal component factors from the functional data of each participant. Elastic net regression was used to investigate the association between behavioral phenotypes and weight change. Results: Functional principal component analysis identified 2 distinctive behavioral phenotypes, which were named the high or low adherence level and late or early behavior change. The first phenotype explained 47% to 69% of each factor, whereas the second phenotype explained 11% to 17% of the total behavioral dynamics. High or low adherence level was associated with weight change for adherence to screen time (beta = -.0766, 95% CI -.1245 to -.0312), fruit and vegetable intake (beta = .1770, 95% CI .0642-.2561), exercise (beta = -.0711, 95% CI -.0892 to -.0363), drinking water (beta = -.0203, 95% CI -.0218 to -.0123), and sleep duration. Late or early behavioral changes were significantly associated with weight loss for changes in screen time (beta=.0440, 95% CI .0186-.0550), fruit and vegetable intake (beta = -.1177, 95% CI -.1441 to -.0680), and sleep duration (beta = -.0991, 95% CI -.1254 to -.0597). Conclusions: Overall level of adherence, or the high or low adherence level, and a gradual improvement or deterioration in health-related behaviors, or the late or early behavior change, were differently associated with weight loss for distinctive obesity-related lifestyle behaviors. A large proportion of health-related behaviors remained stable throughout the intervention, which indicates that health care professionals should closely monitor changes made during the early stages of the intervention.

Similarly, drinking context has been largely ignored in studies of day-level motives. Therefore, the present study sought to test whether drinking context mediates the relation between affect and motivation on drinking outcomes at both day and person levels. Method: Emerging adults who drank in solitary and social settings (N = 107; 61.2% female) completed 21 days ecological momentary assessments. Affect was assessed during morning/afternoon reports; drinking motives were assessed during afternoon reports; and past-night drinking context, drinking quantity, and negative consequences were assessed during next morning reports. Two-level multilevel structural equation models tested whether within-person and between-person levels of predrinking affect were indirectly associated with negative consequences through predrinking motives, drinking context (social vs. solitary), and drinking quantity. Results: At the day and person levels, positive affect was associated with higher social and enhancement motives. At the day level, positive affect indirectly predicted consequences through social motives, social (vs. solitary) drinking, and drinking quantity, whereas positive affect indirectly predicted consequences through enhancement motives and drinking quantity above and beyond context. At the day and person levels, negative affect was associated with coping motives, but coping was not associated with context, drinking quantity, nor consequences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that positive affect was linked to drinking outcomes through motives (enhancement and social) and contexts (social), whereas negative affect was not. Findings suggest that positively valenced drinking motives may be an important just-in-time intervention target. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Results suggested that both within-person deviations (and between-person levels) of social drinking motives as well as social drinking (at the within-person level in particular) were mechanisms of risk for alcohol misuse within a motivation framework. However, negative affect and coping motives were not. Findings add to skepticism related to negative reinforcement models of risk for addictive behavior in nonclinical samples and suggest that context and drinking motives may be important event- and person-level mechanisms to target in preventive interventions.

To adequately harness this opportunity, it is critical that the design and development of digital mental health technologies be informed by the needs and preferences of end users. Despite young people and clinicians being the predominant users of such technologies, few studies have examined their perspectives on different digital mental health technologies. Objective: This study aims to understand the technologies that young people have access to and use in their everyday lives and what applications of these technologies they are interested in to support their mental health. The study also explores the technologies that youth mental health clinicians currently use within their practice and what applications of these technologies they are interested in to support their clients' mental health. Methods: Youth mental health service users (aged 12-25 years) from both primary and specialist services, young people from the general population (aged 16-25 years), and youth mental health clinicians completed a web-based survey exploring technology ownership, use of, and interest levels in using different digital interventions to support their mental health or that of their clients. Results: A total of 588 young people and 73 youth mental health clinicians completed the survey. Smartphone ownership or private access among young people within mental health services and the general population was universal (611/617, 99%), with high levels of access to computers and social media. Youth technology use was frequent, with 63.3% (387/611) using smartphones several times an hour. Clinicians reported using smartphones (61/76, 80%) and video chat (69/76, 91%) commonly in clinical practice and found them to be helpful. Approximately 50% (296/609) of the young people used mental health apps, which was significantly less than the clinicians (chi23=28.8, n = 670; P < .001). Similarly, clinicians were significantly more interested in using technology for mental health support than young people (H3 = 55.90; P < .001), with 100% (73/73) of clinicians being at least slightly interested in technology to support mental health compared with 88% (520/591) of young people. Follow-up tests revealed no difference in interest between young people from the general population, primary mental health services, and specialist mental health services (all P > .23). Young people were most interested in web-based self-help, mobile self-help, and blended therapy. Conclusions: Technology access is pervasive among young people within and outside of youth mental health services; clinicians are already using technology to support clinical care, and there is widespread interest in digital mental health technologies among these groups of end users. These findings provide important insights into the perspectives of young people and clinicians regarding the value of digital mental health interventions in supporting youth mental health.

Ex-smokers iCoach was a widely available app for smoking cessation used by 404,551 European smokers between June 15, 2011, and June 21, 2013. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the uptake of a freely available digital smoking cessation intervention and its effects on smoking-related outcomes. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether there were distinct trajectories of iCoach use, examine which baseline characteristics were associated with user groups (based on the intensity of use), and assess if and how these groups were associated with smoking-related outcomes. Methods: Analyses were performed using data from iCoach users registered between June 15, 2011, and June 21, 2013. Smoking-related data were collected at baseline and every 3 months thereafter, with a maximum of 8 follow-ups. First, group-based modeling was applied to detect distinct trajectories of app use. This was performed in a subset of steady users who had completed at least 1 follow-up measurement. Second, ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the baseline characteristics that were associated with user group membership. Finally, generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between the user groups and smoking status, quitting stage, and self-efficacy over time. Results: Of the 311,567 iCoach users, a subset of 26,785 (8.6%) steady iCoach users were identified and categorized into 4 distinct user groups: low (n = 17,422, 65.04%), mild (n = 4088, 15.26%), moderate (n = 4415, 16.48%), and intensive (n = 860, 3.21%) users. Older users and users who found it important to quit smoking had higher odds of more intensive app use, whereas men, employed users, heavy smokers, and users with higher self-efficacy scores had lower odds of more intensive app use. User groups were significantly associated with subsequent smoking status, quitting stage, and self-efficacy over time. For all groups, over time, the probability of being a smoker decreased, whereas the probability of being in an improved quitting stage increased, as did the self-efficacy to quit smoking. For all outcomes, the greatest change was observed between baseline and the first follow-up at 3 months. In the intensive user group, the greatest change was seen between baseline and the 9-month follow-up, with the observed change declining gradually in moderate, mild, and low users. Conclusions: In the subset of steady iCoach users, more intensive app use was associated with higher smoking cessation rates, increased quitting stage, and higher self-efficacy to quit smoking over time. These users seemed to benefit most from the app in the first 3 months of use. Women and older users were more likely to use the app more intensively. Additionally, users who found quitting difficult used the iCoach app more intensively and grew more confident in their ability to quit over time.

for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in resource-constrained South Africa, we evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a counsellor-supported PTSD Coach mobile application (app) (PTSD Coach-CS) intervention on PTSD and associated sequelae in a community sample. Participants (female = 89%; black = 77%; aged 19-61) with PTSD were randomised to PTSD Coach-CS (n = 32) or enhanced Treatment-as-Usual (n = 30), and assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items, at pre- to post-treatment and follow-up (1 and 3 months). We also collected data on user experiences of the PTSD Coach app with self-administered surveys. We conducted an intent-to-treat analysis and linear mixed models. A significant (group x time) effect for the CAPS-5 (F3.136 = 3.33, p = 0.02) indicated a greater reduction in PTSD symptom severity over time for the intervention group with a significant between-group effect size detected at 3-month follow-up. Significant between-group effect sizes were detected in self-reported stress symptom reduction in the intervention group at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Participants perceived the app as helpful and were satisfied with the app. Findings suggest PTSD Coach-CS as a suitable low-cost intervention and potential treatment alternative for adults with PTSD in a resource-constrained country. Replication in larger samples is needed to fully support effectiveness.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2021-82249-001). Background: Depressive symptoms are one of the most common and ever-increasing mental health problems among students worldwide. Conventional treatment options, particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet- and mobile-based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the treatment gap. Objective: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self-help smartphone app (MCT & More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of students with self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions on treatment adherence and effectiveness. Methods: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and randomized to either the intervention group (n = 200), who received access to the self-help smartphone app MCT & More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait-list control group (n = 200). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression) served as the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (self-esteem) and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-abbreviated version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions. Outcome expectations were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy. Results: Per-protocol (PP), complete-case, and intention-to-treat analyses showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F1222 = 3.98; P = .047; d = 0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self-esteem (PP: F1220 = 8.79; P = .003; d = 0.77) in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group. Most participants regularly used the self-help smartphone app (91/120, 75.8%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward internet- and mobile-based interventions (r = 0.260; P = .004) and the more positive the outcome expectation (r = 0.236; P = .009), the more frequently the self-help smartphone app was used. Conclusions: The effectiveness of the self-help smartphone app MCT & More was demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait-list control group. The app could be offered regularly as a low-threshold intervention to enhance students' health.

Background This pilot study explored the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a web-based intervention for survivors of physical inactivity-related cancers through a two-arm, 12-week randomized controlled trial. Secondarily, this study tested the change in physical activity (PA) and sedentary time with intervention exposure. MethodsPrior to randomization to the intervention (n = 45) or behavior ""as usual"" wait-listed control (n = 40) groups, participants completed baseline surveys and an accelerometer protocol. The intervention focused on increasing PA and decreasing sedentary time through social cognitive theory techniques. Follow-up acceptability/usability surveys (intervention group only) and accelerometers were sent after the intervention period. Information on intervention completion, adverse events, and user statistics were collected to determine feasibility. Median login time and mean acceptability/usability scores were calculated. Results Participants (mean age = 60 +/- 7 years) included female (n = 80, 94%) and male survivors of breast (82%), colon (6%), endometrial (6%), bladder (4%), and kidney (2%) cancer. Seventy-eight (91.7%) participants returned partially or fully complete post-intervention data. There were no reported injuries or safety concerns. Intervention participants logged into the website for a total of 95 min (Q1, Q3 = 11, 204). System usability scores (72 +/- 3) indicated above average usability of the website. Changes in time spent active and sedentary were not statistically significantly different between groups (p = 0.45), but within-group changes suggested intervention group participants spent more time active and less time sedentary after the intervention. Conclusion Results of this pilot study suggest its feasibility and acceptability for survivors of several inactivity-related cancers. Additional research to determine long-term efficacy is warranted. This low-cost online-only intervention has the potential to have a very broad reach. Trial Registration Clinical Trials Number: NCT03983083.

We aimed to establish the feasibility of undertaking a definitive randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a blended digital intervention for relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Methods: This multicentre, feasibility, cluster randomised controlled trial aimed to compare Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER) with treatment as usual in community mental health services (CMHS) in Glasgow and Melbourne. CMHS were the unit of randomisation, selected on the basis of those that probably had five or more care coordinators willing to participate. Participants were eligible if they were older than 16 years, had a schizophrenia or related diagnosis confirmed via case records, were able to provide informed consent, had contact with CMHS, and had had a relapse within the previous 2 years. Participants were randomised within stratified clusters to EMPOWER or to continue their usual approach to care. EMPOWER blended a smartphone for active monitoring of early warning signs with peer support to promote self-management and clinical triage to promote access to relapse prevention. Main outcomes were feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety, which was assessed through face-to-face interviews. App usage was assessed via the smartphone and self-report. Primary end point was 12 months. Participants, research assistants and other team members involved in delivering the intervention were not masked to treatment conditions. Assessment of relapse was done by an independent adjudication panel masked to randomisation group. The study is registered at ISRCTN (99559262). Findings: We identified and randomised eight CMHS (six in Glasgow and two in Melbourne) comprising 47 care coordinators. We recruited 86 service users between Jan 19 and Aug 8, 2018; 73 were randomised (42 [58%] to EMPOWER and 31 [42%] to treatment as usual). There were 37 (51%) men and 36 (49%) women. At 12 months, main outcomes were collected for 32 (76%) of service users in the EMPOWER group and 30 (97%) of service users in the treatment as usual group. Of those randomised to EMPOWER, 30 (71%) met our a priori criterion of more than 33% adherence to daily monitoring that assumed feasibility. Median time to discontinuation of these participants was 31.5 weeks (SD 14.5). There were 29 adverse events in the EMPOWER group and 25 adverse events in the treatment as usual group. There were 13 app-related adverse events, affecting 11 people, one of which was serious. Fear of relapse was lower in the EMPOWER group than in the treatment as usual group at 12 months (mean difference -7.53 (95% CI -14.45 to 0.60; Cohen's d -0.53). Interpretation: A trial of digital technology to monitor early warning signs blended with peer support and clinical triage to detect and prevent relapse appears to be feasible, safe, and acceptable. A further main trial is merited. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","",10.1016/s2215-0366,*Disease Management;*Relapse Prevention;*Schizophrenia;*Digital Interventions,,

However, evidence from real-world clinical practice is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital interventions by tracking HbA1c improvements over 1 year in real-world clinical settings. Methods: Patients used the Health2Sync mobile app to track self-measured outcomes and communicate with health care professionals (HCPs). HCPs used the web-based Patient Management Platform to monitor patient data, view test results from clinical laboratories, and communicate with patients. Patients who have been onboarded for at least 13 months and have consecutive HbA1c findings for 5 quarters were included in the analysis. They were then stratified into 3 groups (high, mid, and low retention) based on their level of use of Health2Sync in the first 6 months of onboarding. A mixed model was built to compare the slopes of the rate of reduction in HbA1c among the groups. In addition, these patients' retention on the app from the seventh to the 12th month was verified through multiple comparisons. Results: A sample of 2036 users was included in the analysis. With the mixed model coefficient estimates, we found that app users had significant HbA1c percentage reductions as the passed quarter count increased (t=-9.869; P<.001), and that effectiveness increased in the high (t=-5.173) and mid retention (t=-6.620) groups as the interaction effects were significantly negative compared to that in the low retention group (P<.001) in the passed quarter count. The low retention group also had the highest average HbA1c value at the end of 13 months (high: 7.01%, SD 1.02%; mid: 6.99%, SD 1.00%; low: 7.17%, SD 1.14%) (Bonferroni correction: high vs low, P=.07; mid vs low, P=.02; high vs mid, P>.99). The level of use of the app remained consistent in the seventh to the 12th month after onboarding (high: 5.23 [SD 1.37] months, mid: 2.43 [SD 1.68] months, low: 0.41 [SD 0.97] months) (P<.001). Conclusions: Our analysis shows that continuous usage of the diabetes management app is associated with better glycemic control in real-world clinical practice. Further studies are required to reveal the efficacy for specific diabetes types and to observe effects beyond 1 year.

Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors. Objective: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information. Methods: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges. Results: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03). Conclusions: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

As mobile device and app technology advances, it is likely that video-based interventions will become increasingly common. Although clinic waiting rooms are complex and busy environments, they offer the opportunity to facilitate engagement with video-based digital interventions as patients wait to see their providers. However, to increase efficiency in public health, leverage the scalability and low cost of implementing digital interventions, and keep up with rapidly advancing technology and user needs, more design and development guidance is needed for video-based tailored interventions. Objective: We provide a tutorial for digital intervention researchers and developers to efficiently design and develop video-based tailored digital health interventions. We describe the challenges and solutions encountered with Positive Health Check (PHC), a hybrid app used to deliver a brief, interactive, individually tailored video-based HIV behavioral counseling intervention. PHC uses video clips and multimedia digital assets to deliver intervention content, including interactive tailored messages and graphics, a repurposed animated video, and patient and provider handouts generated in real time by PHC. Methods: We chronicle multiple challenges and solutions for the following: (1) using video as a medium to enhance user engagement, (2) navigating the complexity of linking a database of video clips with other digital assets, and (3) identifying the main steps involved in building an app that will seamlessly deliver to users individually tailored messages, graphics, and handouts. Results: We leveraged video to enhance user engagement by featuring ""video doctors,"" full-screen video, storyboards, and streamlined scripts. We developed an approach to link the database of video clips with other digital assets through script coding and flow diagrams of algorithms to deliver a tailored user experience. We identified the steps to app development by using keyframes to design the integration of video and digital assets, using agile development methods to gather iterative feedback from multidisciplinary teams, and creating an intelligent data-driven back-end solution to tailor message delivery to individual users. Conclusions: Video-based digital health interventions will continue to play an important role in the future of HIV prevention and treatment, as well as other clinical health practices. However, facilitating the adoption of an HIV video intervention in HIV clinical settings is a work in progress. Our experience in designing and developing PHC presented unique challenges due to the extensive use of a large database of videos tailored individually to each user. Although PHC focuses on promoting the health and well-being of persons with HIV, the challenges and solutions presented in this tutorial are transferable to the design and development of video-based digital health interventions focused on other areas of health.

Mobile health (mHealth) applications might be an innovative way to deliver mindfulness and relaxation interventions for cancer patients. However, data about the implementation of apps in health care are lacking. Adherence to mHealth interventions is an important indicator for a successful implementation and might be needed to maximize treatment effects. However, the decrease in distress might reduce the motivation of patients to engage in such self-care tools in the long run. Therefore, the aim of this analysis was to investigate the association between the course of distress over time and the adherence to a relaxation self-care app in cancer patients. Methods: We developed an app for cancer patients (CanRelax) and 83 patients who participated in the prospective observational study used the app at least once. The evaluation was guided by the RE-AIM framework, and this analysis focused on the implementation of the app. Patients were grouped into five subgroups according to their course of distress over 10 weeks (Distress Thermometer). These subgroups of patients were compared with each other to identify different user groups. Findings: About half of the patients were adherent over 10 weeks. However, a decrease in distress was associated with lower adherence to the app intervention, whereas patients with moderate distress or an increase in distress showed more adherence. Conclusion: Adherence to an app intervention might be also driven by patients' distress level. A decrease in distress might reduce patients' motivation to continue with a self-care intervention. The interplay between adherence and treatment outcomes should be explored in upcoming mHealth trials to get a better understanding for the implementation of such interventions. Encouraging patients to continue self-care interventions is a major challenge in integrative medicine if they are delivered digitally.

However, in low-income settings there is limited knowledge on YP's phone and internet access to inform the feasibility of implementing digital health interventions. Objective: We investigated access to information and communication technologies among adolescents and young adults in Zimbabwe. Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted from October to December 2018 among YP aged 13-24 years in 5 communities in urban and peri-urban Harare and Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe. Consenting YP completed a self-completed tablet-based questionnaire on mobile phone ownership and use, and use of the internet. The primary outcome was the proportion who reported owning a mobile phone. Secondary outcomes included phone and internet access and use behavior, and ownership and use of other technological devices. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with mobile phone ownership and with internet access, with adjustment for the one-stage cluster sampling design. A priori exploratory variables were age, sex, marital status, and urban/peri-urban residence. Results: A total of 634/719 (88.2%) eligible YP, mean age 18.0 years (SD 3.3) and 62.6% (397/634) females, participated. Of the YP interviewed, 62.6% (396/633; 95% CI 58.5-66.5) reported owning a phone and a further 4.3% (27/633) reported having access to a shared phone. Phone ownership increased with age: 27.0% (43/159) of 13-15-year olds, 61.0% (72/118) of 16-17-year olds, 71.5% (103/144) of 18-19-year olds, and 84.7% (171/202) of 20-24-year olds (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5) per year increase. Ownership was similar among females and males: 61.0% (236/387; 95% CI 55.6-66.1) versus 64.8% (153/236; 95% CI 57.8-71.2), age-adjusted OR 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-1.1); higher in those with secondary level education compared to primary or no education: 67.1% (346/516; 95% CI 62.6-71.2) versus 26% (21/82; 95% CI 16.4-37.7), age-adjusted OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.1-4.8); and similar across other sociodemographic factors. YP reported that 85.3% (361/423) of phones, either owned or shared, were smartphones. Among phone owners, the most commonly used phone app was WhatsApp (71.2%, 282/396), and 16.4% (65/396) reported having ever used their phone to track their health. A total of 407/631 (64.5%; 95% CI 60.3-68.5) currently had access to the internet (used in last 3 months on any device) with access increasing with age (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3 per year increase). In age-adjusted analysis, internet access was higher among males, the unmarried, those with a higher level of education, phone owners, and those who had lived in the community for more than 1 year. The aspect of the internet that YP most disliked was unwanted sexual (29.2%, 136/465) and violent (13.1%, 61/465) content. Conclusions: Mobile phone-based interventions may be feasible in this population; however, such interventions could increase inequity, especially if they require access to the internet. Internet-based interventions should consider potential risks for participants and incorporate skill-building sessions on safe internet and phone use.

The co-occurrence of alcohol use and sexual risk taking contribute significantly to STI acquisition. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are ideally suited for our target population and have demonstrated increases in STI testing in young people, as well as reductions in alcohol use. Objective: This pilot study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the views of adolescent girls (age range 15-19 years old; 74.6%, 279/374 white) on the desired qualities and content of an mHealth app for sexual health. Methods: We conducted nine 60-min in-depth interviews (IDIs) to gather information and identify themes of sexual health and alcohol use, and we tested the feasibility of using a two-week social media campaign to collect survey information regarding sexual health risk in adolescent girls. Results: We iteratively coded IDIs and identified major themes around pressure of alcohol use, lack of STI knowledge, male pressure to not use condoms, and pregnancy as a worse outcome than STIs. Results from the web-based survey on risky health behaviors, which was completed by 367 participants, support the use of a sexual health app designed for girls. Conclusions: Future work will integrate these themes to inform the development of a culturally sensitive mHealth app to prevent STIs among adolescent girls.

Objective: This study examined the long-term efficacy of a theory-based app (including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], theory of planned behavior [TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene among insomnia patients. Methods: The study was a 2-arm single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group that used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT-I], n = 156) or a control group that received only patient education (PE, n = 156) through the app. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postintervention. Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included attitudes toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self-monitoring, behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in outcomes between the two groups and across time. Results: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT-I group compared with the PE group (P = .02 at 1 month, P = .04 at 3 months, and P = .02 at 6 months) as were sleep quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived behavioral control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with self-regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of the intervention on outcomes. Conclusions: Health care providers might consider using a CBT-I app to improve sleep among insomnia patients.

Data were analyzed from the 74 respondents who responded to open-ended questions. Certified peer specialists identified previously unidentified facilitators including the augmented use of certified peer specialists in combination with mHealth to improve engagement. One emerging theme identified was the belief that mHealth interventions may promote social isolation if not designed appropriately. Certified peer specialists appear to prefer using tablets instead of smartphones. Integrating certified peer specialists' perspectives of barriers and facilitators to mHealth engagement may promote initial and sustained mHealth engagement among consumers with serious mental illness. Future research using implementation science frameworks should examine these previously identified barriers and facilitators to mHealth engagement as correlates and/or predictors of engagement among service users.

Methods: The study was conducted between September 2015-April 2016 drawing on the Medical Research Council's Framework. Phase one comprised of a patients' survey and focus groups with cardiac nurses. The automated short message service reminder was piloted in phase two. We recruited 78 patients and randomized to receive either 12-week daily reminders or usual care. The primary outcome was the effect on medication adherence; secondary outcomes were self-efficacy, ejection fraction, functional capacity, readmission rate and quality of life. Results: Feasibility was evidenced by high ownership of mobile phones and high interest in receiving reminders. Participants in the intervention group showed significantly higher medication adherence compared with the control group. Conclusion: The mHealth intervention was well accepted and feasible with early evidence of effectiveness that needs to be confirmed in a fully powered future randomized clinical trial.

This opinion survey aimed to examine clinical psychologists' predictions for the next 10 years regarding the status of psychotherapy in Turkey in two stages, with 107 participants in one and 69 in the other. The results revealed that the techniques predicted to increase the most in the next decade were the use of eclectic therapy, mindfulness therapy, solution-focused therapy, system/family approaches, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Among the therapeutic interventions expected to increase in popularity were Internet-based programs, smartphone applications, and problem solving. In terms of type of psychotherapists, family counselors with certificate/graduate degrees and Internet-based treatment programs were expected to become more common, whereas it was considered that shorter treatment formats and crisis intervention approaches would be preferred. In sum, the present findings provide a current overview for Turkey and a comparison with other literature findings.

Jeronimus, Frank J. Blaauw, Rob B. K. Wanders, Ando C. Emerencia, Hendrika M. Schenk, Stijn De Vos, Evelien Snippe, Marieke Wichers, Johanna T. W. Wigman, Elisabeth H. Bos, Klaas J. Wardenaar and Peter De Jonge (International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research, 2016[Jun], Vol 25[2], 123-144). In the original article, there was an error in the estimated prevalence of depression symptom levels. The estimates were reported to be based on the cut-off norms for the DASS provided by Lovibond and Lovibond (1995). However, the stress scale cut-off was also used for the depression scale. Consequently, estimates of the prevalence of depression were too conservative, as the correct norms by Lovibond would have resulted in 26.2% participants with mild symptom levels (instead of the reported 14.8%), 16.8% with moderate levels (instead of 9.1%), 7.2% with severe symptom levels (instead of 3.9%), and 3.0% with extremely severe levels (instead of 1.3%). Importantly, the reported results based on the continuous anxiety and stress scales were not affected, and neither were all other estimations of the role of depression and of gender differences in the paper and table. None of the subsequent papers using the HowNutsAreTheDutch dataset were affected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-44271-001). HowNutsAreTheDutch (Dutch: HoeGekIsNL) is a national crowdsourcing study designed to investigate multiple continuous mental health dimensions in a sample from the general population (n = 12,503). Its main objective is to create an empirically based representation of mental strengths and vulnerabilities, accounting for (i) dimensionality and heterogeneity, (ii) interactivity between symptoms and strengths, and (iii) intra-individual variability. To do so, HowNutsAreTheDutch (HND) makes use of an internet platform that allows participants to (a) compare themselves to other participants via cross-sectional questionnaires and (b) to monitor themselves three times a day for 30 days with an intensive longitudinal diary study via their smartphone. These data enable for personalized feedback to participants, a study of profiles of mental strengths and weaknesses, and zooming into the fine-grained level of dynamic relationships between variables over time. Measuring both psychiatric symptomatology and mental strengths and resources enables for an investigation of their interactions, which may underlie the wide variety of observed mental states in the population. The present paper describes the applied methods and technology, and presents the sample characteristics.

Although this procedure is a reliable diagnosis tool that can improve chances of successful treatment and survival, it can be associated with pain and anxiety. In this context, a mobile health intervention (BIO H-App) has been developed to address patients' symptoms of pain and anxiety through a relaxation exercise. In order to reduce patients' burden, the intervention was designed to be delivered through mobile devices (e.g., tablets, smartphones). Aims: To conduct a pilot study in order to obtain usability data and to assess users' satisfaction with the BIO H-App intervention. Method: Participants (N = 16, mean age=42.43), were recruited online. The study consisted of three steps: 1) the online pre-test survey, 2) use of the BIO H-App, and 3) a post-test survey. Results: Participants found the intervention component to be useful and a majority of them (75%) declared they would recommend the application to a patient. All tasks were completed successfully and participants were satisfied with the intervention. Conclusions: Although its efficacy needs to be evaluated, BIO-H App is a promising intervention considering users' satisfaction with it and its ease of use.

The main objective is to develop a framework for mobile e-mental health systems reviewing existing e-mental health apps and discussing necessary system requirements. The chapter states that current e-mental health apps do not offer any facilities to promote social interaction between the counselor and the user. The proposed framework requires personalized interactions between a virtual counselor and a student. It provides personalized feedback to reduce stress level and enhances personal stress management strategies. This requires integration of technologies for facial expression detection, speech and emotion recognition as well as other psycho-physiological feedback. A prototype system for e-mental health has been developed and the components of the system architecture have been widely discussed including the need for a coping processor.

This research sought to iteratively develop a theory-driven mobile app, Vegethon, to increase vegetable consumption. Methods: Development of Vegethon followed phases outlined by the IDEAS framework: 1) empathize with users (qualitative interviews, n = 18); 2) specify target behavior; 3) ground in behavioral theory; 4) ideate implementation strategies; 5) prototype potential products; 6) gather user feedback (qualitative interviews, n = 14; questionnaire, n = 41); 7) build minimum viable product; and 8) pilot potential efficacy and usability (pilot RCT, n = 17). Findings from each phase informed subsequent phases. The target population that informed intervention development was 18-50 years of age, had BMIs of 28-40 kg/m2, and lived in the geographical area surrounding Stanford University. A full description of the final version of Vegethon is included in the paper. Results: Qualitative findings that shaped initial intervention conception were: participants' interests in accountability without judgment; their desire for simple and efficient dietary self-monitoring; and the importance of planning meals in advance. Qualitative findings identified during intervention refinement were the need for a focus on vegetable self-monitoring; inclusion of vegetable challenges; simplification of features; advice and inspiration for eating vegetables; reminder notifications; and peer comparison. Pilot RCT findings suggested the initial efficacy, acceptance, and feasibility of the intervention. The final version of Vegethon enabled easy self-monitoring of vegetable consumption and included a range of features designed to engage the user (e.g., surprise challenges; leaderboard; weekly reports). Vegethon was coded for its inclusion of 18 behavior change techniques (BCTs) (e.g., goal setting; feedback; social comparison; prompts/cues; framing/reframing; identity). Conclusions: Vegethon is a theory-based, user-informed mobile intervention that was systematically developed using the IDEAS framework. Vegethon targets increased vegetable consumption among overweight adults and is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial.

PC participants lost significantly more weight than Controls at 6 months (net effect -1.92 kg [CI -3.17, -0.67], P = 0.003), but not at 12 and 24 months. Conclusions: Despite high intervention engagement and study retention, the inclusion of behavioral principles and tools in both interventions, and weight loss in all treatment groups, CP did not lead to weight loss, and PC did not lead to sustained weight loss relative to Control. Although mHealth solutions offer broad dissemination and scalability, the CITY results sound a cautionary note concerning intervention delivery by mobile applications. Effective intervention may require the efficiency of mobile technology, the social support and human interaction of personal coaching, and an adaptive approach to intervention design.

These technologies offer a wide range of applications that cover the spectrum of health care delivery. Although preliminary experiments in mHealth demonstrate promising results, more robust real-world evidence is needed for widespread adoption and sustainment of these technologies. Objective: Our aim was to identify the problems/challenges associated with sustained use of an mHealth addiction recovery support app and to determine strategies used by agencies that successfully sustained client use of A-CHESS. Methods: Qualitative inquiry assessed staff perceptions about organizational attributes and strategies associated with sustained use of the mobile app, A-CHESS. A total of 73 interviews of clinicians and administrators were conducted. The initial interviews (n = 36) occurred at the implementation of A-CHESS. Follow-up interviews (n = 37) occurred approximately 12 and 24 months later. A coding scheme was developed and Multiuser NVivo was used to manage and analyze the blinded interview data. Results: Successful strategies used by treatment providers to sustain A-CHESS included (1) strong leadership support, (2) use of client feedback reports to follow up on non-engaged clients, (3) identify passionate staff and incorporate A-CHESS discussions in weekly meetings, (4) develop A-CHESS guidelines related to client use, (5) establish internal work groups to engage clients, and (6) establish a financial strategy to sustain A-CHESS use. The study also identified attributes of A-CHESS that enhanced as well as inhibited its sustainability. Conclusions: Mobile apps can play an important role in health care delivery. However, providers will need to develop strategies for engaging both staff and patients in ongoing use of the apps. They will also need to rework business processes to accommodate the changes in communication frequency and style, learn to use app data for decision making, and identify financing mechanisms for supporting these changes.

Simon, Sarah Clingan, Jaeden Siler, Lorilei Snyder and Evette Ludman (Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2014[Feb], Vol 16[2], 20-27). In the original article, the authors have inadvertently added the same image file for Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 has now been updated with the correct image, with the caption ""I would like to open a message with Subject Line..."". (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-11878-004). Background: Computerized, Internet-delivered interventions can be efficacious; however, uptake and maintaining sustained client engagement are still big challenges. We see the development of effective engagement strategies as the next frontier in online health interventions, an area where much creative research has begun. We also argue that for engagement strategies to accomplish their purpose with novel targeted populations, they need to be tailored to such populations (ie, content is designed with the target population in mind). User-centered design frameworks provide a theoretical foundation for increasing user engagement and uptake by including users in development. However, deciding how to implement this approach to enage users in mental health intervention development is challenging. Objective: The aim of this study was to get user input and feedback on acceptability of messaging content intended to engage suicidal individuals. Methods: In March 2013, clinic intake staff distributed flyers announcing the study, ""Your Feedback Counts"" to potential participants (individuals waiting to be seen for a mental health appointment) together with the Patient Health Questionnaire. The flyer explained that a score of two or three (""more than half the days"" or ""nearly every day"" respectively) on the suicide ideation question made them eligible to provide feedback on components of a suicide prevention intervention under development. The patient could access an anonymous online survey by following a link. After providing consent online, participants completed the anonymous survey. Results: Thirty-four individuals provided data on past demographic information. Participants reported that they would be most drawn to an intervention where they knew that they were cared about, that was personalized, that others like them had found it helpful, and that included examples with real people. Participants preferred email invitations with subject lines expressing concern and availability of extra resources. Participants also provided feedback about a media prototype including a brand design and advertisement video for introducing the intervention. Conclusions: This paper provides one model (including development of an engagement survey, audience for an engagement survey, methods for presenting results of an engagement survey) for including target users in the development of uptake strategies for online mental health interventions.

Washington St., Marion, IN, US, 46953, jason.runyan@indwes.edu Switzerland","Virtues, broadly understood as stable and robust dispositions for certain responses across morally relevant situations, have been a growing topic of interest in psychology. A central topic of discussion has been whether studies showing that situations can strongly influence our responses provide evidence against the existence of virtues (as a kind of stable and robust disposition). In this review, we examine reasons for thinking that the prevailing methods for examining situational influences are limited in their ability to test dispositional stability and robustness; or, then, whether virtues exist. We make the case that these limitations can be addressed by aggregating repeated, cross-situational assessments of environmental, psychological and physiological variables within everyday life-a form of assessment often called ecological momentary assessment (EMA, or experience sampling).We, then, examine how advances in smartphone application (app) technology, and their mass adoption, make these mobile devices an unprecedented vehicle for EMA and, thus, the psychological study of virtue. We, additionally, examine how smartphones might be used for virtue development by promoting changes in thought and behavior within daily life; a technique often called ecological momentary intervention (EMI). While EMA/I have become widely employed since the 1980s for the purposes of understanding and promoting change amongst clinical populations, few EMA/I studies have been devoted to understanding or promoting virtues within non-clinical populations. Further, most EMA/I studies have relied on journaling, PDAs, phone calls and/or text messaging systems. We explore how smartphone app technology provides a means of making EMA a more robust psychological method, EMI a more robust way of promoting positive change, and, as a result, opens up new possibilities for studying and promoting virtues.

Secondary prevention interventions such as cardiac rehabilitation are not widely available for this population. An Internet-based version could offer a feasible alternative. Objective: Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of a Web-based cardiac rehabilitation program for those with angina. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial, recruiting those diagnosed with angina from general practitioners (GPs) in primary care to an intervention or control group. Intervention group participants were offered a 6-week Web-based rehabilitation program (""ActivateYourHeart""). The program was introduced during a face-to-face appointment and then delivered via the Internet (no further face-to-face contact). The program contained information about the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) and set each user goals around physical activity, diet, managing emotions, and smoking. Performance against goals was reviewed throughout the program and goals were then reset/modified. Participants completed an online exercise diary and communicated with rehabilitation specialists through an email link/synchronized chat room. Participants in the control group continued with GP treatment as usual, which consisted of being placed on a CHD register and attending an annual review. Outcomes were measured at 6-week and 6-month follow-ups during face-to-face assessments. The primary outcome measure was change in daily steps at 6 weeks, measured using an accelerometer. Secondary outcome measures were energy expenditure (EE), duration of sedentary activity (DSA), duration of moderate activity (DMA), weight, diastolic/systolic blood pressure, and body fat percentage. Self-assessed questionnaire outcomes included fat/fiber intake, anxiety/depression, self-efficacy, and quality of life (QOL). Results: A total of 94 participants were recruited and randomized to the intervention (n = 48) or the usual care (n = 46) group; 84 and 73 participants completed the 6-week and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. The mean number of log-ins to the program was 18.68 (SD 13.13, range 1-51), an average of 3 log-ins per week per participant. Change in daily steps walked at the 6-week follow-up was +497 (SD 2171) in the intervention group and -861 (SD 2534) in the control group (95% CI 263-2451, P = .02). Significant intervention effects were observed at the 6-week follow-up in EE (+43.94 kcal, 95% CI 43.93-309.98, P = .01), DSA (-7.79 minutes, 95% CI -55.01 to -7.01, P = .01), DMA (+6.31 minutes, 95% CI 6.01-51.20, P = .01), weight (-0.56 kg, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.15, P = .02), self-efficacy (95% CI 0.30-4.79, P = .03), emotional QOL score (95% CI 0.01-0.54, P = .04), and angina frequency (95% CI 8.57-35.05, P = .002). Significant benefits in angina frequency (95% CI 1.89-29.41, P = .02) and social QOL score (95% CI 0.05-0.54, P = .02) were also observed at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: An Internet-based secondary prevention intervention could be offered to those with angina. A larger pragmatic trial is required to provide definitive evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.

Lunch Line includes a public display that enables passersby to view the reported eating behavior of a group of people and take on daily ""food challenges,"" and a mobile web application that allows users to record personal food choices, report challenge achievement, and compare their choices with other users and with USDA recommendations. Results from a 3-week field evaluation at a company cafeteria showed that our integrated system was effective in drawing public attention, delivering challenges, enabling self-tracking and self-reflection, and providing feedback on personal and group choices.

Most people with depression are treated in general medicine using antidepressant medication. Outcomes are poor due to failure points across the care system, including patient non-adherence, failure of physicians to optimize the treatment regimens, and lack of patient-physician communication. This study reports on the 4-week pilot deployment of MedLink, a mobile intervention aimed at systemically addressing each of these failure points. A mobile app provides the patient with information and collects data on symptoms and side-effects. A cellularly enabled pill bottle monitors medication adherence. Data from these are provided to the physician and patient to foster communication and medication adjustments. Usability evaluation was generally favorable. Medication adherence rates in this first deployment were high with no patients discontinuing, and 84% of doses taken. Depressive symptom severity was significantly reduced. This study supports the use of a comprehensive, systemic approach to mHealth solutions to enhance processes of care for depression by general medicine physicians.",nan,,adherence;mHealth;mental health,,
