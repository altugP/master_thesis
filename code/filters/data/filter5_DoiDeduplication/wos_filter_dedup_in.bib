Therefore, this study aimed to explore the opinions of GPs on how
clinical guidelines for perinatal depression facilitated them to empower
pregnant women to make an informed decision about the use of
antidepressants in pregnancy. Using qualitative methodology,
semi-structured interviews were conducted with one GP from eight
practices in Derry City, Northern Ireland. The main areas explored in
the interview schedule were guidelines on perinatal depression, GP
understanding of `patient empowerment', GP practice policy on patient
decision making, constraints of treatment decisions and a discussion on
which health promotion model was most reflective of their views on the
provision of healthcare. Only some of the GPs were aware of the National
Institute National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Clinical

depression guidelines but acknowledged that they were generic and lacked
utility, instead they relied on their own professional experience and
patient knowledge to make decisions. Involving patients in treatment
decision making was viewed as central to patient empowerment; however,
its application in routine practice was often limited by complex
clinical scenarios. Findings from this study suggested an identified
need for a local specialist perinatal service to provide evidence-based
information and timely support. An empowerment model for the improvement
of perinatal depression has been developed from the study findings as a
framework for women, their community and their GPs.},

 abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to present a project in Australia, where
participants use smartphones to measure the level of traffic noise in
their homes. Through the data collected, participants learn if they are
subjected to sleep disturbances and, if so, understand how they can
manage the issue to protect their health. The project also has a
secondary purpose: the local council would like to engage its community
through the exercise and be seen as acting on the community's problems.
Design/methodology/approach - The approach taken was the development of
a mobile app call 2Loud? that turns the smartphones of participants into
noise sensors with accuracies comparable to professional sound-meters.
The data collected are analyzed by environment and acoustic experts, and
personalized feedback, in the form of mitigation strategies, is then
provided. The strategies are delivered through the app to allow
participants to share within the community and hence, propagate the
solution to non-participants.
Findings - Participants who are technologically literate find a sense of
empowerment as a result. They confirmed the importance of ``closing the
loop{''} with the feedback they received after their voluntary data
collection effort. They also reported some sense of satisfaction with
the technology as an interim solution and noted the council's creative
approach.
Originality/value - This project first showcases how a participatory
setup could be extended to create a ``closed-loop{''} feedback system
that further empowers its users. It is also a case example of how an
organization could engage and manage its stakeholders' expectations
through innovative use of participatory sensing systems.},

 abstract = {Mobile healthcare services exist to improve outcomes, but they have the
potential to improve output of service provision as well. Operations
management research on remote and mobile healthcare interventions tends
to focus solely on output efficiency and leaving the questions of
output-outcome relations to clinical medicine. However, with preventive
interventions output-outcome relation plays a critical role in defining
life-cycle long costs, outcomes and production effects of the
technological intervention. Healthcare operations management can offer a
valuable framework for better understanding remote mobile service
systems and their effects. In this paper we explore different types of
efficiency implications using mobile phone based solutions as an
interesting example. We discuss time and location constraints of
traditional service provision and how mobile services can impact them.
We conclude by defining a new approach to studying mobile interventions
from an operations management perspective.},

 abstract = {Violence researchers have called for the use of person-oriented methods
to understand differences that have been found in biopsychosocial
consequences among those who experience intimate partner violence (IPV).
To address this issue, we apply a person-oriented statistical method,
latent profile analysis (LPA), to test for meaningful subgroups of a
sample of 448 battered women based on participants' appraisals of their
vulnerability relative to their violent partner, depressive symptoms,
physical injuries, overall physical health functioning, and their
positive and negative social relationships with friends and family. The
LPA established five significantly distinct subgroups. Using MANOVA, we
examined these subgroups and their respective IPV exposure, both
concomitant and separate incidents within the past year. Those with the
most intensive violence exposure show the greatest level of challenge
and impairment. However, the groups with comparable levels of IPV
exposure manifest distinctly different configurations of biopsychosocial
profiles, indicating a need for adaptive interventions commensurate with
these profiles. We discuss the implications these findings have for
developing adaptive interventions for battered women, as well as the
potential utility of person-oriented tools for violence researchers.},

 abstract = {Background: Patients are important stakeholders in pharmacovigilance;
however, little formal evaluation has been undertaken of existing
patient reporting schemes within and outside Europe. If patient
reporting is to be recognized as beneficial for pharmacovigilance and
further optimized, methodology and best practice must be internationally
shared and promoted.
Objective: This study aims to review the methods of patient reporting of
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 11 countries worldwide and to compare
different aspects of their experiences.
Methods: A survey based on telephone interviews, e-mail discussions and
field visits of existing practices in consumer and patient reporting of
ADRs was performed in the second half of 2010.
Results: The start dates of the patient reporting schemes vary from 1964
(Australia) to 2010 (Norway). The number of patient reports per country
varies widely. Most countries would ideally spend more resources on
making the public aware of the possibility that patients can report
ADRs.
Most countries have three different ways for patients to report ADRs a
paper form, an electronic form on a website or by telephone. The level
of sophistication of the electronic forms varies.
The route of handling of patients' and healthcare professionals' ADR
reports is the same for most countries. Personalized feedback on the
reported association for each report is only given by four
organizations. All countries have guidelines for the identification of
patients in the database and most undertake checks for duplicate
reports. In all countries, with the exception of Norway, it is possible
to ask patients for follow-up. None of the organizations seek medical
confirmation for each patient report. There is a difference between
countries that do a causality assessment for each incoming ADR report
and countries that only do a causality assessment of reports when they
are looking at a potential signal. All countries assess the seriousness
of reports, mostly by using the criteria of the CIOMS committee.
In all countries, patient reports are used for signal detection purposes
and in publications about ADRs. The Netherlands and the UK are actively
evaluating their patient reporting schemes. None of the organizations
hired additional staff when they started with patient reporting.
Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive review on the methods
used in patient reporting of ADRs. Although there are some differences
in the way various countries handle patient reports of ADRs, the
importance of giving the public the opportunity to report and the
additional scientific value of the collected data is widely recognized
by the countries who participated in this survey.},

 abstract = {Background: There has been limited study of factors influencing response
rates and attrition in online research. Online experiments were nested
within the pilot (study 1, n = 3780) and main trial (study 2, n = 2667)
phases of an evaluation of a Web-based intervention for hazardous
drinkers: the Down Your Drink randomized controlled trial (DYD-RCT).
Objectives: The objective was to determine whether differences in the
length and relevance of questionnaires can impact upon loss to follow-up
in online trials.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial design was used. All participants
who consented to enter DYD-RCT and completed the primary outcome
questionnaires were randomized to complete one of four secondary outcome
questionnaires at baseline and at follow-up. These questionnaires varied
in length (additional 23 or 34 versus 10 items) and relevance (alcohol
problems versus mental health). The outcome measure was the proportion
of participants who completed follow-up at each of two follow-up
intervals: study 1 after 1 and 3 months and study 2 after 3 and 12
months.
Results: At all four follow-up intervals there were no significant
effects of additional questionnaire length on follow-up. Randomization
to the less relevant questionnaire resulted in significantly lower rates
of follow-up in two of the four assessments made (absolute difference of
4\%, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0\%-8\%, in both study 1 after 1
month and in study 2 after 12 months). A post hoc pooled analysis across
all four follow-up intervals found this effect of marginal statistical
significance (unadjusted difference, 3\%, range 1\%-5\%, P = .01;
difference adjusted for prespecified covariates, 3\%, range 0\%-5\%, P =
.05).
Conclusions: Apparently minor differences in study design decisions may
have a measurable impact on attrition in trials. Further investigation
is warranted of the impact of the relevance of outcome measures on
follow-up rates and, more broadly, of the consequences of what we ask
participants to do when we invite them to take part in research studies.},

 abstract = {Background: Attrition from follow-up is a major methodological challenge
in randomized trials. Incentives are known to improve response rates in
cross-sectional postal and online surveys, yet few studies have
investigated whether they can reduce attrition from follow-up in online
trials, which are particularly vulnerable to low follow-up rates.
Objectives: Our objective was to determine the impact of incentives on
follow-up rates in an online trial.
Methods: Two randomized controlled trials were embedded in a large
online trial of a Web-based intervention to reduce alcohol consumption
(the Down Your Drink randomized controlled trial, DYD-RCT). Participants
were those in the DYD pilot trial eligible for 3-month follow-up (study
1) and those eligible for 12-month follow-up in the DYD main trial
(study 2). Participants in both studies were randomly allocated to
receive an offer of an incentive or to receive no offer of an incentive.
In study 1, participants in the incentive arm were randomly offered a 5
pound Amazon. co.uk gift voucher, a 5 pound charity donation to Cancer
Research UK, or entry in a prize draw for 250 pound. In study 2,
participants in the incentive arm were offered a 10 pound Amazon. co.uk
gift voucher. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who
completed follow-up questionnaires in the incentive arm(s) compared with
the no incentive arm.
Results: In study 1 (n = 1226), there was no significant difference in
response rates between those participants offered an incentive (175/615,
29\%) and those with no offer (162/611, 27\%) (difference = 2\%, 95\%
confidence interval {[}CI] -3\% to 7\%). There was no significant
difference in response rates among the three different incentives
offered. In study 2 (n = 2591), response rates were 9\% higher in the
group offered an incentive (476/1296, 37\%) than in the group not
offered an incentive (364/1295, 28\%) (difference = 9\%, 95\% CI 5\% to
12\%, P < .001). The incremental cost per extra successful follow-up in
the incentive arm was 110 pound in study 1 and 52 pound in study 2.
Conclusion: Whereas an offer of a 10 pound Amazon. co.uk gift voucher
can increase follow-up rates in online trials, an offer of a lower
incentive may not. The marginal costs involved require careful
consideration.

M. \& Larson, R. (1987). Validity and reliability of the
experience-sampling method. Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease,
175(9), 526-536] has been used to elucidate the cognitive-behavioural
mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of complex mental
disorders as well as mechanisms involved in resilience from such states.
We present an argument for the development of intelligent real-time
therapy (iRTT). Machine learning and reinforcement learning specifically
may be used to optimise the delivery of interventions by observing and
altering the timing of real-time therapies based on ongoing ESM
measures.
Aims: The aims of the present article are to outline the principles of
iRTT and to consider how it would be applied to complex problems such as
suicide prevention.
Methods: Relevant literature was identified through use of PychInfo.
Results: iRTT may provide an important and ecologically valid adjunct to
traditional CBT, providing a means of balancing population-based data
with individual data, thus addressing the ``knowledge-practice gap{''}

and facilitating the delivery of interventions in situ, thereby
addressing the ``therapy-real-world gap{''}.
Conclusions: iRTT may provide a platform for the development of
individualised and multifaceted momentary intervention strategies that
are ecologically valid and aimed at attenuating pathological pathways to
complex mental health problems and amplifying pathways associated with
resilience.},

 abstract = {Objective: A growing number of health information technologies (HIT) are
being developed and tested to address mental health conditions. HIT
includes Internet and smartphone programs or apps, text messaging
protocols and telepsychiatry. We reviewed the promise and evidence that
HIT can expand access to mental health care and reduce disparities in
use of services across groups in need.
Conclusions: Limited reach of mental health services is a pervasive
problem in the United States, and solving it will require innovations
that enable us to extend our clinical reach into underserved populations
without significantly expanding our workforce. In theory, HIT can extend
access to mental health care in several ways: by enhancing the reach to
priority populations, addressing system capacity issues, supporting
training, improving clinical decision making, lowering the ``consumer's
threshold{''} for treatment, delivering preventive mental health
services, speeding innovation and adoption and reducing cost barriers to
treatment. At present, evidence is limited, and research is needed,
focusing on consumer engagement strategies, the benefits and harms of
HIT for the therapeutic relationship and the comparative effectiveness
of various HIT alternatives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Background: To reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance, there is a
pressing need for worldwide implementation of effective interventions to
promote more prudent prescribing of antibiotics for acute LRTI. This
study is a process analysis of the GRACE/INTRO trial of a multifactorial
intervention that reduced antibiotic prescribing for acute LRTI in six
European countries. The aim was to understand how the interventions were
implemented and to examine effects of the interventions on general
practitioners' (GPs') and patients' attitudes.
Methods: GPs were cluster randomised to one of three intervention groups
or a control group. The intervention groups received web-based training
in either use of the C-reactive protein (CRP) test, communication skills
and use of a patient booklet, or training in both. GP attitudes were
measured before and after the intervention using constructs from the
Theory of Planned Behaviour and a Website Satisfaction Questionnaire.
Effects of the interventions on patients were assessed by a
post-intervention questionnaire assessing patient enablement,
satisfaction with the consultation, and beliefs about the risks and need
for antibiotics.
Results: GPs in all countries and intervention groups had very positive
perceptions of the intervention and the web-based training, and felt
that taking part had helped them to reduce prescribing. All GPs
perceived reducing prescribing as more important and less risky
following the intervention, and GPs in the communication groups reported
increased confidence to reduce prescribing. Patients in the
communication groups who received the booklet reported the highest
levels of enablement and satisfaction and had greater awareness that
antibiotics could be unnecessary and harmful.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the interventions should be
broadly acceptable to both GPs and patients, as well as feasible to roll
out more widely across Europe. There are also some indications that they
could help to engender changes in GP and patient attitudes that will be
helpful in the longer-term, such as increased awareness of the potential
disadvantages of antibiotics and increased confidence to manage LRTI
without them. Given the positive effects of the booklet on patient
beliefs and attitudes, it seems logical to extend the use of the patient
booklet to all patients.},

 abstract = {Background: Preventing smoking initiation among adolescents is crucial
to reducing tobacco-caused death and disease. This study focuses on the
effectiveness of a Web-based computer-tailored smoking prevention
intervention aimed at adolescents.
Objective: The intent of the study was to describe the intervention
characteristics and to show the effectiveness and results of a
randomized controlled trial. We hypothesized that the intervention would
prevent smoking initiation among Dutch secondary school students aged
10-20 years and would have the largest smoking prevention effect among
the age cohort of 14-16 years, as smoking uptake in that period is
highest.
Methods: The intervention consisted of a questionnaire and fully
automated computer-tailored feedback on intention to start smoking and
motivational determinants. A total of 89 secondary schools were
recruited via postal mail and randomized into either the
computer-tailored intervention condition or the control condition.
Participants had to complete a Web-based questionnaire at baseline and
at 6-month follow-up. Data on smoking initiation were collected from 897
students from these schools. To identify intervention effects,
multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted using multiple
imputation.
Results: Smoking initiation among students aged 10-20 years was
borderline significantly lower in the experimental condition as compared
to the control condition 6 months after baseline (OR 0.25, 95\% CI
0.05-1.21, P=.09). Additional analyses of the data for the 14-16 year
age group showed a significant effect, with 11.5\% (24/209) of the
students in the control condition reporting initiation compared to 5.7\%
(10/176) in the experimental condition (OR 0.22, 95\% CI 0.05-1.02,
P=.05). No moderation effects were found regarding gender and
educational level.
Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that computer-tailored
smoking prevention programs are a promising way of preventing smoking
initiation among adolescents for at least 6 months, in particular among
the age cohort of 14-16 years. Further research is needed to focus on
long-term effects.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUNDThe aim of this study was to examine the moderation effects of
sex, age, and psychosocial determinants (intention, social support, and
modeling) of physical activity (PA) in the relationship between an
Internet-based computer-tailored intervention program (Activ-O-Meter)
and modes of PA and commuting.
METHODSThe Activ-O-Meter with intervention and control condition was
delivered to 555 adolescents (boys 50.5\%, mean age: 14.4years) in 6
European cities. Data on different modes of PA and commuting, sex, age,
and psychosocial determinants were collected at baseline and at 3-months
follow-up, using questionnaires. The moderation effects of psychosocial
determinants, sex, and age on the association between condition and
modes of PA and commuting were tested with linear regression.
RESULTSModeration analysis showed that the following increased
adolescents' responsiveness to the intervention: male sex, older age,
higher baseline intention to increase PA, higher perceived social
support or modeling level by siblings, and low perceived social support
by friends.
CONCLUSIONSThese findings should be taken into consideration when
planning PA interventions in adolescents. Future intervention studies
should also include moderation analysis in order to get a deeper
understanding of why interventions are not effective for certain
individuals and how this unresponsiveness could be overcome.},

are not sufficient to measure actual adherence. Recording and
recognizing personal activities in a ubiquitous environment has thus
emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we present a model-driven
sensor data assessment mechanism capable of identifying high level
adherence-related activity patterns from low level signals. The proposed
intelligent sensing algorithm can learn from a population-based training
data set and adapt quickly to an individual's exercise patterns using
the acquired personal data. Upon the recognition of each activity, the
system can further provide personalized feedback such as exercise
coaching, fitness planning, and abnormal event detection. The resulted
system demonstrates the feasibility of a portable real-time personalized
adherence feedback system that could be used for advanced healthcare

 abstract = {Background: Obesity and stress are among the most common
lifestyle-related health problems. Most of the current disease
prevention and management models are not satisfactorily cost-effective
and hardly reach those who need them the most. Therefore, novel
evidence-based controlled interventions are necessary to evaluate models
for prevention and treatment based on self-management. This randomized
controlled trial examines the effectiveness, applicability, and
acceptability of different lifestyle interventions with individuals
having symptoms of metabolic syndrome and psychological distress. The
offered interventions are based on cognitive behavioral approaches, and
are designed for enhancing general well-being and supporting
personalized lifestyle changes.
Methods/Design: 339 obese individuals reporting stress symptoms were
recruited and randomized to either (1) a minimal contact web-guided
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-based (CBT) intervention including an
approach of health assessment and coaching methods, (2) a mobile-guided
intervention comprising of mindfulness, acceptance and value-based
exercises, (3) a face-to-face group intervention using mindfulness,
acceptance and value-based approach, or (4) a control group. The
participants were measured three times during the study (pre = week 0,
post = week 10, and follow-up = week 36). Psychological well-being,
lifestyles and habits, eating behaviors, and user experiences were
measured using online surveys. Laboratory measurements for physical
well-being and general health were performed including e. g. liver
function, thyroid glands, kidney function, blood lipids and glucose
levels and body composition analysis. In addition, a 3-day ambulatory
heart rate and 7-day movement data were collected for analyzing stress,
recovery, physical activity, and sleep patterns. Food intake data were
collected with a 48 -hour diet recall interview via telephone.
Differences in the effects of the interventions would be examined using
multiple-group modeling techniques, and effect-size calculations.
Discussion: This study will provide additional knowledge about the
effects of three low intensity interventions for improving general
well-being among individuals with obesity and stress symptoms. The study
will show effects of two technology guided self-help interventions as
well as effect of an acceptance and value-based brief group
intervention. Those who might benefit from the aforesaid interventions
will increase knowledge base to better understand what mechanisms
facilitate effects of the interventions.},

assessing early-stage effectiveness and usability of a smartphone-based
intervention system that provides a stand-alone, self-administered
intervention option, the Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for
Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A). The LBMI-A provided numerous features
for intervening with ongoing drinking, craving, connection with
supportive others, managing life problems, high-risk location alerting,
and activity scheduling. Methods: Twenty-eight participants, ranging in
age from 22 to 45, who met criteria for an alcohol use disorder used an
LBMI-A-enabled smartphone for 6 weeks. Results: Participants indicated
the LBMI-A intervention modules were helpful in highlighting alcohol use
patterns. Tools related to managing alcohol craving, monitoring
consumption, and identifying triggers to drink were rated by
participants as particularly helpful. Participants also demonstrated
significant reductions in hazardous alcohol use while using the system
(56\% of days spent hazardously drinking at baseline vs. 25\% while
using the LBMI-A) and drinks per day diminished by 52\%. Conclusions:
Implications for system improvement as well as suggestions for designing
ecological momentary assessment and intervention systems for substance
use disorders are discussed.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a system that can capture and assess users'
emotional status and provide support. The system includes a user profile
database, an expert knowledge rule base, an education material database,
and a portable emotion-sensing module. A user answers standardized
questionnaires and visual analogue scales regarding to different
emotions including depression, anxiety and stress, while recording daily
activities and contextual factors leading to mood change through the
portable emotion-sensing module in real time. The portable
emotion-sensing module stores these variables in the cloud-based user
profile database via Wi-Fi. The expert knowledge rule base in the cloud
server receives values and distributing patterns of the variables to
determine the corresponding mood symptoms and their severity. The
educational material database, based on mindfulness-based cognitive
therapy, returns guidance and encouragements to the portable emotion
sensing module through the internet to provide the user with real-time
support.
In the focus group testing, we invited twenty medical professionals and
ten graduate school students to evaluate the system. Preliminary results
showed that participants found the system helpful in achieving better
awareness of their ever-changing emotional states, and that
mindfulness-based audio guidance indeed helped them reduce stress and
negative emotions. Subsequent pilot studies on patients with mild to
moderate depression will help elucidate the clinical feasibility and
efficacy of the proposed system.},

 abstract = {Functionality of feedback in pedagogical processes has been broadly
analyzed in face-to-face learning, although to a lesser extent than in
on-line learning. Narciss (2004, 2008) distinguishes two dimensions
within the feedback, the semantic dimension and the structural
dimension. This article aims to analyze, from the student's perspective,
the semantic dimension of feedback in a virtual learning environment
(VLE). Firstly, importance that VLE students give to feedback and its
degree of personalization is analyzed. Later, the object of analysis is
usefulness that students deem feedback should have, paying special
attention to each of its semantic sub-dimensions (Narciss, 2004). A
survey was conducted among students of Business Administration degree of
the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). 182 students took part,
divided into two groups (pilot and control). It was proved that 90\% of
students give great or very great importance to reception of feedback
from their tutors, a relevance they consider to be higher than the one
in a face-toface environment. This percentage is around 75\% with regard
to importance given to the level of personalization of feedback. The
development of a factor analysis has revealed that usefulness of
personalized feedback perceived by the students can be subsumed under
two large dimensions: the one that makes learning (related to its
semantic dimension) easier and the motivational one (by allowing an
easier and more fluid communication with the tutor, contributing not to
leave the course, etc.) The latter dimension has also proved to be key
in order to attain improvements in the students' satisfaction with the
learning process. This research was funded by the Catalan government and
the UOC, within the framework of projects to Improve Teaching Quality
(ITQ).},

 abstract = {Previous work within health communication has been concerned with how to
tailor intervention content in a way that is most effective in
supporting the individual in changing health behaviors such as smoking,
physical activity or diet. This kind of tailoring is based on data
gathered from the user through questionnaires with textual feedback
adapted by algorithms pre-specified according to behavioral theory. The
Internet opened up for a new generation of tailored interventions that
were more sophisticated, more synchronous and more longitudinal. In the
current paper I present the results of a scoping review to explore
literature relevant to how the third generation of tailored
interventions might look like, using sensors embedded in commonly
available ICT such as PCs and smartphones and machine learning for
tailoring these kinds of interventions in real time, thus becoming
cognitive infocommunications (CogInfoCom) applications that enhance the
human brain. The main aim of the paper is to inspire further
multidisciplinary research and development on addressing the important
topic of supporting the individual in changing and maintaining health
behaviors.},

 abstract = {Background With a lifetime risk for major depressive disorder of up to
50\%, depression is a common comorbidity in multiple sclerosis but
remains widely underdiagnosed and untreated. We investigated the
potential of a fully automated, internet-based, cognitive behavioural
therapy programme, Deprexis, to reduce depressive symptoms in patients
with multiple sclerosis.
Methods For this randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients from
an outpatient clinic in Hamburg, Germany. Patients aged 18-65 years were
eligible for inclusion if they had multiple sclerosis and self-reported
depressive symptoms. By use of a computer-generated randomisation
sequence, we allocated 90 patients (1:1; no blocking or stratification)
to either the intervention group or a waitlist control group for 9
weeks. The primary endpoint was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as
assessed by an intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01663649.
Findings 71 patients completed the trial: 35 patients in the
intervention group and 36 patients in the control group. During the
intervention, BDI scores decreased in the Deprexis group and increased
in the control group, yielding a positive effect of Deprexis relative to
the waitlist group (mean group difference -4.02 points {[}95\% CI -7.26
to -0.79], p=0.015, effect size d=0.53). Worsening of depressive
symptoms from below to above the clinical cutoff (BDI > 13) occurred in
three (7\%) of 45 patients in the control group and no patients in the
Deprexis group. We noted no adverse events with respect to new
occurrence of suicidal ideation during the trial.
Interpretation Psychological online-intervention programmes could be
suitable for patients with multiple sclerosis who are unable to
regularly attend therapeutic sessions because of mobility impairments.},

 abstract = {Purpose: The transtheoretical model (TTM) was used to provide tailored
nursing for lifestyle management such as diet, physical activity, and
smoking cessation. The present study aims to assess the provision of
intervention delivery methods, intervention elements, and stage-matched
interventions, in order to identify ways in which information technology
is used in the TTM-based research.
Methods: The relevant literature was selected by two researchers using
inclusion criteria after searching for ``TTM (transtheoretical or stage
of change){''} and ``nursing{''} from the databases PubMed and CINAHL.
The selected studies were categorized in terms of study characteristics,
intervention delivery method, intervention element, and use and level of
stage-matched intervention.
Results: A total of 35 studies were selected including eight studies
that used information communication technology (Id). Nine different
intervention delivery methods were used, of which ``face-to-face{''} was
the most common at 24 times. Of the 35 studies, 26 provided
stage-matched interventions. Seven different intervention elements were
used, of which ``counseling{''} was the most common at 27 times. Of all
the intervention elements, tailored feedback used Id the most at seven
instances out of nine, and there was a significant difference in the
rate of ICT usage among intervention elements.
Conclusions: ICT is not yet actively used in the TTM-based nursing
interventions. Stage-matched interventions and TTM concepts were shown
to be in partial use also in the TTM-based interventions. Therefore, it
is necessary to develop a variety of ways to use ICT in tailored nursing
interventions and to use TTM frameworks and concepts. Copyright (C)

 abstract = {Bariatric surgery is the most effective means of long-term weight loss.
Knowledge gaps and lack of engagement in pre-operative patients can
result in suboptimal outcome after surgery. Mobile technology, utilizing
ecological momentary assessment (EMA)/intervention (EMI), has shown
tremendous promise in changing behaviors. The primary objective of the
study is to assess feasibility of using smartphone app with EMA/EMI
functionality to prepare patients for bariatric surgery.
Subjects seeking primary bariatric surgery were provided a smartphone
app containing video-based education modules with linked assessments to
evaluate mastery of topic. Subjects received algorithmic EMA text
messages soliciting a response regarding lifestyle behavior. Upon
answering, subjects received tailored EMI text messaging supporting
healthy lifestyle.
Thirty subjects (27 female and 3 male), with age of 41.3 +/- 11.4 years
and BMI of 46.3 +/- 7.4 kg/m(2) were enrolled. Twenty subjects completed
the study. Ten subjects withdrew. On average, seven out of nine
education modules were completed (70.9 +/- 27.3 \%), and 37.8/123 EMA
were answered (30.7 +/- 21.7 \%), with response time of 17.4 +/- 4.4
min. Subjects reported high satisfaction with the app. Many felt that
the app fit into their routine ``somewhat easily{''} or ``very
easily{''} (n = 12), had ``perfect{''} amount of EMA messages (n = 8),
and was very helpful in preparing for surgery (n = 7).
This study is the first to reveal the feasibility of using a smartphone
app in the education and engagement of patients prior to bariatric
surgery. The app was well-received based on subject satisfaction scores
and revealed trends toward positive behavior change and increased weight
loss. Randomized trials are necessary to delineate true efficacy.},

 abstract = {Several benefits of mobile health (mHealth) technologies have been
documented in the literature. However, available literature is not as
``extensive{''} as those in developed countries, particularly on
implementation issues and challenges of mHealth interventions. This is
worrying, as addressing the usefulness and appropriateness of a mHealth
program before implementation is essential. This paper comparatively
assessed the ease and appropriateness of implementing a Short Messaging
Service (SMS)-based mHealth technology in developing countries of
similar settings. The framework of Marshall, Lewis and Whittaker, based
on the Bridges' criteria, was chosen for the comparison. It was found
that Burundi has many challenges that need to be addressed first before
implementing a mHealth intervention. Zimbabwe enjoys a better funding
model with more `experience' in eHealth projects and initiatives, and a
successful mHealth intervention is more plausible. This paper highlights
the importance of critically assessing the mHealth intervention and the
target community before implementation.},

 abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the Region of
the Americas, making cardiovascular risk assessment a critical component
of the clinical decision-making process. This process is facilitated by
the use of appropriate tools.
This article presents the technical characteristics of an application
(app) developed by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health
Organization (PAHO/WHO) for mobile devices and computers. Called the
Cardiovascular Risk Calculator, it is based on WHO risk tables and
applied to the countries of the Region. The article details the
epidemiological basis of the diagram for predicting cardiovascular risk
and describes the app and its four modules, its main audiences, its
production process, and finally, the initial results and some of the
challenges.
Four months after its launch, the application was being used daily by
more than 12 000 users and had been downloaded in virtually all the
countries of the Region. The app can be used in by physicians, nurses,
and other technical personnel in their daily practice, especially at the
primary care level. Since it can also be used by the general public,
special attention was paid to its design and tutorial and to ensuring
that the clinical estimates and recommendations were easy to understand.
This type of app facilitates communication between health care providers
and users, and its systematic use in the health services, especially in
primary care services, should be promoted.},

 abstract = {Background: In the last decade, there has been an increasing advent of
innovative concepts in psychological interventions aimed at empowering
bipolar patients by means of technological advancements and taking
advantage of the proliferation of the Internet. Since the adoption of
these technologies for behavioral monitoring and intervention is not
trivial in clinical practice, the main objective of this review is to
provide an overview and to discuss the several initiatives published so
far in the literature related to the Internet based technologies aimed
to deliver evidence based psychological interventions for bipolar
disorder patients.
Methods: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the
literature from multiple technological, psychiatric and psychological
domains. The search was conducted by applying the Boolean algorithm
``BIPOLAR AND DISORDER AND (treatment OR intervention) AND (online OR
Internet OR web based OR smartphone OR mobile){''} at MEDLINE, SCOPUS,
EMBASE, ClinicalTrials,ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar.
Results: We identified over 251 potential entries matching the search
criteria and after a thorough manual review, 29 publications pertaining
to 12 different projects, specifically focusing On psychological
interventions for bipolar patients through diverse Internet-based
methods, were selected.
Limitations: Taking into consideration the diversity of the initiatives
and the inconclusive main outcome results of the studies, there is still
limited evidence available to draw arm conclusions about the efficacy of
interventions using Internet-based technologies for bipolar disorder.
Conclusions: However, considering the high rates of retention and
compliance reported, they represent a potential highly feasible and
acceptable method of delivering this kind of interventions to bipolar
patients. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Background: Interventions based on the experience sampling method (ESM)
are ideally suited to provide insight into personal, contextualized
affective patterns in the flow of daily life. Recently, we showed that
an ESM-intervention focusing on positive affect was associated with a
decrease in symptoms in patients with depression. The aim of the present
study was to examine whether ESM-intervention increased patient
empowerment.
Methods: Depressed out-patients (n = 102) receiving
psychopharmacological treatment who had participated in a randomized
controlled trial with three arms: (i) an experimental group receiving
six weeks of ESM self-monitoring combined with weekly feedback sessions,
(ii) a pseudo-experimental group participating in six weeks of ESM
self-monitoring without feedback, and (iii) a control group (treatment
as usual only). Patients were recruited in the Netherlands between
January 2010 and February 2012. Self-report empowerment scores were
obtained pre- and post-intervention.
Results: There was an effect of group x assessment period, indicating
that the experimental (B = 7.26, P = 0.061, d = 0.44, statistically
imprecise) and pseudo-experimental group (B = 11.19, P = 0.003, d =
0.76) increased more in reported empowerment compared to the control
group. In the pseudo-experimental group, 29\% of the participants showed
a statistically reliable increase in empowerment score and 0\% reliable
decrease compared to 17\% reliable increase and 21\% reliable decrease
in the control group. The experimental group showed 19\% reliable
increase and 4\% reliable decrease.
Conclusions: These findings tentatively suggest that self-monitoring to
complement standard antidepressant treatment may increase patients'
feelings of empowerment. Further research is necessary to investigate
long-term empowering effects of self-monitoring in combination with
person-tailored feedback. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

 abstract = {Recently, interactive approaches aimed at helping people practice
mindfulness have appeared in the literature. However, the few available
user studies for such approaches focus only on short-term effects and
are carried out in a lab or in a similar artificial setting. In this
study, we aim instead at assessing the effectiveness of a mobile
mindfulness app when used by people in their everyday contexts and over
a prolonged period of time. People could participate in the study by
downloading the app from Apple's App Store as well as Google Play and by
answering a mindfulness questionnaire at three pre-set times over a
4-week period. Moreover, the app automatically collected usage data each
time it was used and qualitative feedback at the end of the study.
Results reveal that users with no or minimal experience with meditation
significantly increased their level of mindfulness over the 4-week study
period. Moreover, the qualitative feedback provided by participants
indicates that the app was positively perceived as beautiful and its
usage elicited positive feelings in most of them. We discuss possible
factors that could have contributed to the obtained results. Finally, we
analyze how many users abandoned the study and at what times, comparing
such data with other studies based on app stores distribution, and
giving possible reasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{WOS:000369638300004,
 abstract = {Purpose: Functionality of feedback in pedagogical processes has been
broadly analyzed in face-to-face learning, although to a lesser extent
than in the on-line learning. Narciss (2004, 2008) distinguishes two
dimensions within the feedback, the semantic dimension and the
structural dimension. This article aims to analyze, from the student's
perspective, the semantic dimension of feedback in a virtual learning
environment (VLE).
Firstly, we analyze the importance that VLE students give to feedback
and its degree of personalization. Later, the usefulness that students
deem feedback should have, paying special attention to each of its
semantic subdimensions (Narciss, 2004).
Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among students of
Business Administration degree of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya
(UOC). 182 students took part, separated into two groups (pilot and
control).
Findings: It has been proved that 90\% of students give a great or very
great importance to reception of feedback from their tutors, a relevance
they consider to be higher than the one within a face-to-face
environment. This percentage is around 75\% with regard to the
importance given to the level of personalization of feedback. The
development of a factor analysis has revealed that usefulness of
personalized feedback perceived by the students can be subsumed under
two large dimensions: the one that facilitates learning (related to its
semantic dimension) and the motivational one (by allowing an easier and
more fluid communication with the tutor, contributing not to leave the
course, etc.) The latter dimension has been also proved to be key in
order to attain improvements in the students' satisfaction with the
learning process.
This research was funded by the Catalan government and the UOC, within
the framework of projects to Improve Teaching Quality (ITQ).
Originality/value: Implementing personalized feedback has a relevant
impact on the student, who values it because it makes his learning
process easier, richer and more significant. Moreover, it has a clear
motivational effect over the student, which had not been sufficiently
evidenced by other researches. Such effect needs not to be
underestimated, particularly within an on-line environment, where
dropout rate is usually high.},

 abstract = {Background: Guided online psychological self-management interventions
offer broad prospects for the treatment of people with mild to moderate
mental health problems, but implementation is challenging. The aims of
this study are (1) to gain insight into use of and intention to use
these interventions among primary care health professionals, (2) to
determine the main barriers to use such interventions among non-users.
Methods: An online survey based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and
Use of Technology (UTAUT) was disseminated among mental health
counsellors (MHCs; in Dutch POHs) in GP practices and primary care
psychologists (PCP) in mental health care practices. The survey covered
the current use of online interventions, the intention to use these in
the future, and an operationalization of the UTAUT concepts: performance
expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating
conditions.
Results: In total, 481 MHCs and 290 PCPs responded (24 \%). Of them, 49
\% of MHCs and 21 \% of PCPs currently use online interventions in their
treatments. A further 40 \% of MHCs and 27 \% of PCPs plan to introduce
such interventions within the next year. Both groups were moderately
positive about the presence of eHealth facilitators in their daily
practice. Among current non-users, performance expectancy and
facilitating conditions were significant predictors of usage intention
in both groups of health professionals.
Conclusions: Use of and intention to use online interventions is
relatively high in Dutch primary care. Non-users, particularly,
experience several barriers which need attention to enhance
implementation. There is a need for further efforts regarding
facilitation of and education on eHealth, as well as for research
directed to its normalization in daily practice.},

@article{WOS:000375824000016,
 abstract = {Self-help resources are frequently sought out by individuals with
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); however their efficacy has rarely
been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, despite frequently bold
claims for their efficacy. In the present study, we examined if a
metacognitive self-help manual called myMCT (for ``my Metacognitive
Training{''}), which encompasses exercises from cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) and its ``third wave{''}, is superior to a wait-list
control group in reducing OCD symptoms. Further, we examined whether an
individually adapted version of the manual suited to personal problems
would yield larger effects than the full manual.
Methods: A total of 89 individuals with OCD symptoms participated in the
online study. Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions;
patients either received the full myMCT manual (sent via email
attachment), an individually adapted myMCT version, or were allocated to
a wait-list control group. Before randomization (pre-assessment) and six
weeks later (post-assessment), individuals were asked to fill out
several questionnaires tapping obsessive-compulsive and depressive
symptoms.
Results: Individuals in the two myMCT conditions improved significantly
more on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised total scores than the wait-list
control group (between-group comparison), with a medium to large effect
size. Subsidiary analyses showed that improvements were particularly
pronounced for obsessions, while effects on compulsions were mainly
small and insignificant. Contrary to our expectation, the adapted
version did not lead to better outcomes than the full version.
Discussion: The present study supports the feasibility of a
bibliotherapeutic metacognitive approach for the treatment of obsessive
thoughts. While results confirm prior reports that metacognitive
training is effective in OCD, results are limited by a rather high
non-completion rate. Further studies should investigate the long-term
effectiveness of the approach and its utility in the framework of guided
self-help or face-to-face treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

@article{WOS:000376091700001,
 abstract = {Background: Mixed methods are commonly used in health services research;
however, data are not often integrated to explore complementarity of
findings. A triangulation protocol is one approach to integrating such
data. A retrospective triangulation protocol was carried out on mixed
methods data collected as part of a process evaluation of a trial. The
multi-country randomised controlled trial found that a web-based
training in communication skills (including use of a patient booklet)
and the use of a C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care test decreased
antibiotic prescribing by general practitioners (GPs) for acute cough.
The process evaluation investigated GPs' and patients' experiences of
taking part in the trial.
Methods: Three analysts independently compared findings across four data
sets: qualitative data collected view semi-structured interviews with
(1) 62 patients and (2) 66 GPs and quantitative data collected via
questionnaires with (3) 2886 patients and (4) 346 GPs. Pairwise
comparisons were made between data sets and were categorised as
agreement, partial agreement, dissonance or silence.
Results: Three instances of dissonance occurred in 39 independent
findings. GPs and patients reported different views on the use of a CRP
test. GPs felt that the test was useful in convincing patients to accept
a no-antibiotic decision, but patient data suggested that this was
unnecessary if a full explanation was given. Whilst qualitative data
indicated all patients were generally satisfied with their consultation,
quantitative data indicated highest levels of satisfaction for those
receiving a detailed explanation from their GP with a booklet giving
advice on self-care. Both qualitative and quantitative data sets
indicated higher patient enablement for those in the communication
groups who had received a booklet.
Conclusions: Use of CRP tests does not appear to engage patients or
influence illness perceptions and its effect is more centred on changing
clinician behaviour. Communication skills and the patient booklet were
relevant and useful for all patients and associated with increased
patient satisfaction. A triangulation protocol to integrate qualitative
and quantitative data can reveal findings that need further
interpretation and also highlight areas of dissonance that lead to a
deeper insight than separate analyses.},

@article{WOS:000381213600074,
 abstract = {Background: Aging of the European population and interest in a healthy
population in western countries have contributed to an increase in the
number of health surveys, where the role of survey design, data
collection, and data analysis methodology is clear and recognized by the
whole scientific community. Survey methodology has had to couple with
the challenges deriving from data collection through information and
communications technology (ICT). Telemedicine systems have not used
patients as a source of information, often limiting them to collecting
only biometric data. A more effective telemonitoring system would be
able to collect objective and subjective data (biometric parameters and
symptoms reported by the patients themselves), and to control the
quality of subjective data collected: this goal be achieved only by
using and merging competencies from both survey methodology and health
research.
Objective: The objective of our study was to propose new metrics to
control the quality of data, along with the well-known indicators of
survey methodology. Web questionnaires administered daily to a group of
patients for an extended length of time are a Web health monitoring
survey (WHMS) in a telemedicine system.
Methods: We calculated indicators based on paradata collected during a
WHMS study involving 12 patients, who signed in to the website daily for
2 months.
Results: The patients' involvement was very high: the patients' response
rate ranged between 1.00 and 0.82, with an outlier of 0.65. Item
nonresponse rate was very low, ranging between 0.0\% and 7.4\%. We
propose adherence to the chosen time to connect to the website as a
measure of involvement and cooperation by the patients: the difference
from the median time ranged between 11 and 24 minutes, demonstrating
very good cooperation and involvement from all patients. To measure
habituation to the questionnaire, we also compared nonresponse rates to
the items between the first and the second month of the study, and found
no significant difference. We computed the time to complete the
questionnaire both as a measure of possible burden for patient, and to
detect the risk of automatic responses. Neither of these hypothesis was
confirmed, and differences in time to completion seemed to depend on
health conditions. Focus groups with patients confirmed their
appreciation for this ``new{''} active role in a telemonitoring system.
Conclusions: The main and innovative aspect of our proposal is the use
of a Web questionnaire to virtually recreate a checkup visit,
integrating subjective (patient's information) with objective data
(biometric information). Our results, although preliminary and if need
of further study, appear promising in proposing more effective
telemedicine systems. Survey methodology could have an effective role in
this growing field of research and applications.},

 abstract = {Background
Lifestyle interventions delivered during the retirement transition might
promote healthier ageing. We report a pilot randomised controlled trial
(RCT) of a web-based platform (Living, Eating, Activity and Planning
through retirement; LEAP) promoting healthy eating (based on a
Mediterranean diet (MD)), physical activity (PA) and meaningful social
roles.
Methods
A single blinded, two-arm RCT with individual allocation. Seventy-five
adult regular internet users living in Northeast England, within two
years of retirement, were recruited via employers and randomised in a 2:
1 ratio to receive LEAP or a `usual care' control. Intervention arm
participants were provided with a pedometer to encourage self-monitoring
of PA goals.Feasibility of the trial design and procedures was
established by estimating recruitment and retention rates, and of LEAP
from usage data. At baseline and 8-week follow-up, adherence to a MD
derived from three 24-hour dietary recalls and seven-day PA by
accelerometry were assessed. Healthy ageing outcomes (including measures
of physiological function, physical capability, cognition, psychological
and social wellbeing) were assessed and acceptability established by
compliance with measurement protocols and completion rates. Thematically
analysed, semi-structured, qualitative interviews assessed acceptability
of the intervention, trial design, procedures and outcome measures.
Results
Seventy participants completed the trial; 48 (96\%) participants in the
intervention and 22 (88\%) in the control arm. Participants had
considerable scope for improvement in diet as assessed by MD score. LEAP
was visited a median of 11 times (range 1-80) for a mean total time of
2.5 hours (range 5.5 min-8.3 hours). `Moving more', `eating well' and
`being social' were the most visited modules. At interview, participants
reported that diet and PA modules were important and acceptable within
the context of healthy ageing. Participants found both trial procedures
and outcome assessments acceptable.
Conclusions
The trial procedures and the LEAP intervention proved feasible and
acceptable. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LEAP to promote
healthy lifestyles warrant evaluation in a definitive RCT.},

 abstract = {Use of technology in diabetes management is rapidly advancing and has
the potential to help individuals with diabetes achieve optimal glycemic
control. Over the past 40 years, several devices have been developed and
refined, including the blood glucose meter, insulin pump, and continuous
glucose monitor. When used in tandem, the insulin pump and continuous
glucose monitor have prompted the Artificial Pancreas initiative, aimed
at developing control system for fully automating glucose monitoring and
insulin delivery. In addition to devices, modern technology, such as the
Internet and mobile phone applications, have been used to promote
patient education, support, and intervention to address the behavioral
and emotional challenges of diabetes management. These state-of-the-art
technologies not only have the potential to improve clinical outcomes,
but there are possible psychological benefits, such as improved quality
of life, as well. However, practical and psychosocial limitations
related to advanced technology exist and, in the context of several
technology-related theoretical frameworks, can influence patient
adoption and continued use. It is essential for future diabetes
technology research to address these barriers given that the clinical
benefits appear to largely depend on patient engagement and consistence
of technology use.},

 abstract = {Background: In Japan, the rate of pregnant women who practice antenatal
perineal massage was only 15.1\%.
Aim: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a smartphone
website and a leaflet to support antenatal perineal massage practice for
primiparous women.
Methods: In a randomised control trial, 161 primiparous women were
randomly assigned to a smartphone website group (n = 81) or a leaflet
group (n = 80). Data analysis were by per protocol analysis and
intention to treat analysis.
Findings: Of the 161 women participants, 47 in the smartphone website
group and 49 in the leaflet group completed all questionnaires. Primary
outcome was continuance rate (three times a week over a three week
period) of antenatal perineal massage practice. The rates by a per
protocol analysis were 51.1\% in the smartphone website group and 51.0\%
in the leaflet group, respectively. There was no significant difference
between the groups. Moreover, the rates by an intention to treat
analysis were 29.6\% in the smartphone website group and 31.3\% in the
leaflet group, respectively. There was also no significant difference
between the groups.
There were no significant differences in the evaluation of perineal
massage, childbirth self-efficacy, satisfaction with efforts towards
childbirth, and perineal outcomes following childbirth which were
measured as secondary outcomes between the groups.
Conclusion: There was no significant difference in continuance rate of
antenatal perineal massage practice between those using a smartphone
website and those with a leaflet, however, the rate was better than no
instructions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

 abstract = {The functional impairment associated with serious mental illness (SMI)
places an immense burden on individuals and society, and disability
often persists even after efficacious treatment of psychopathologic
symptoms. Traditional methods of measuring functioning have limitations,
and numerous obstacles reduce the reach and impact of evidence-based
interventions developed to improve functioning in SMI. This review
describes the potential of technological innovations for overcoming the
challenges involved in both functional assessment and intervention in
people with SMI. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which involves
the repeated sampling of naturalistic behaviors and experiences while
individuals carry out their daily lives, has provided a new window
through which the determinants of day-to-day function in SMI can be
observed. EMA has several advantages over traditional assessment methods
and has in recent years evolved to use mobile-based platforms, such as
text messaging and smartphone applications, for both assessment and
promotion of self-management in people with SMI. We will review
promising data regarding the acceptability, adherence, and efficacy of
EMA-based mobile technologies; explore ways in which these technologies
can extend the reach and impact of evidence-based psychosocial
rehabilitative interventions in SMI; and outline future directions for
research in this important area. (C) 2016, AICH -Servier Research Group.},

 abstract = {Background: This report details the development of the Men's Safer Sex
website and the results of a feasibility randomised controlled trial
(RCT), health economic assessment and qualitative evaluation.
Objectives: (1) Develop the Men's Safer Sex website to address barriers
to condom use; (2) determine the best design for an online RCT; (3)
inform the methods for collecting and analysing health economic data;
(4) assess the Sexual Quality of Life (SQoL) questionnaire and European
Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, threelevel version (EQ-5D-3L) to calculate
quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); and (5) explore clinic staff and
men's views of online research methodology.
Methods: (1) Website development: we combined evidence from research
literature and the views of experts (n = 18) and male clinic users (n =
43); (2) feasibility RCT: 159 heterosexually active men were recruited
from three sexual health clinics and were randomised by computer to the
Men's Safer Sex website plus usual care (n = 84) or usual clinic care
only (n = 75). Men were invited to complete online questionnaires at 3,
6, 9 and 12 months, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnoses
were recorded from clinic notes at 12 months; (3) health economic
evaluation: we investigated the impact of using different questionnaires
to calculate utilities and QALYs (the EQ-5D-3L and SQoL questionnaire),
and compared different methods to collect resource use; and (4)
qualitative evaluation: thematic analysis of interviews with 11 male
trial participants and nine clinic staff, as well as free-text comments
from online outcome questionnaires.
Results: (1) Software errors and clinic Wi-Fi access presented
significant challenges. Response rates for online questionnaires were
poor but improved with larger vouchers (from 36\% with (sic) 10 to 50\%
with (sic)30). Clinical records were located for 94\% of participants
for STI diagnoses. There were no group differences in condomless sex
with female partners {[}incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.01, 95\% confidence
interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.96]. New STI diagnoses were recorded for 8.8\%
(7/80) of the intervention group and 13.0\% (9/69) of the control group
(IRR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.29 to 1.89). (2) Health-care resource data were
more complete using patient files than questionnaires. The probability
that the intervention is cost-effective is sensitive to the source of
data used and whether or not data on intended pregnancies are included.
(3) The pilot RCT fitted well around clinical activities but 37\% of the
intervention group did not see the Men's Safer Sex website and technical
problems were frustrating. Men's views of the Men's Safer Sex website
and research procedures were largely positive.
Conclusions: It would be feasible to conduct a large-scale RCT using
clinic STI diagnoses as a primary outcome; however, technical errors and
a poor response rate limited the collection of online self-reported
outcomes. The next steps are (1) to optimise software for online trials,
(2) to find the best ways to integrate digital health promotion with
clinical services, (3) to develop more precise methods for collecting
resource use data and (4) to work out how to overcome barriers to
digital intervention testing and implementation in the NHS.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Cerebral palsy (CP) impacts on the entire family in a
manner that is long-term, complex and multifactorial. In addition, the
quality of the parent-child relationship impacts on many and varied
child outcomes, making the provision of easily accessible and
evidence-based support to parents of children with CP a priority. This
paper reports the protocol of a randomised controlled trial of an
innovative and translatable online intervention, parenting acceptance
and commitment therapy (PACT), for families of children with CP. We
predict that participating in the PACT programme will be associated with
improvements in the parent-child relationship, in child functioning and
in adjustment and quality of life for both parent and child.
Methods and analysis: We aim to recruit 66 parents of children (2-10
years old) diagnosed with CP to this study. Families will be randomly
assigned to two groups: wait-list control and PACT. PACT is a parenting
intervention grounded in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and
developed into an online course `PARENT101 Parenting with Purpose' using
the edX platform. All participants will be offered PACT before
completion of the study. Assessments will take place at baseline,
following completion of PACT and at 6-month follow-up (retention) and
will focus on the parent-child relationship, parent and child adjustment
and parent and child quality of life. Analysis will follow standard
methods for randomised controlled trials using general linear models,
specifically analysis of variance or analysis of covariance.
Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approvals have been obtained through

 abstract = {Background: The objective of the present study was to explore the
efficacy of internet-based intervention on quality of life of patients
with chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP).
Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 81 patients diagnosed
with CPSP after radical resection for lung cancer between January 2013
and July 2014. They were enrolled either as part of the conventional
care group which included 40 cases or the internet-based pain
intervention group which included 41 cases. The patients in the
conventional care group were treated weekly in the outpatient clinic,
while patients in internet-based group were treated via smartphone or
the internet. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was utilized
to assess the quality of life of patients who were suffering from CPSP,
1 month and 3 months after therapy.
Results: The patients in the internet-based pain intervention group
demonstrated similar health-related qualities of life and overall
satisfaction rates compared with the conventional care group (P>0.05).
Conclusion: Internet-based pain management is a suitable option to
improve the quality of life of patients with CPSP after radical
resection for lung cancer.},

 abstract = {The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of differing
delivery schedules of computer-tailored physical activity modules on
engagement and physical activity behaviour change in a web-based
intervention targeting breast cancer survivors.
Insufficiently active breast cancer survivors (n = 492) were randomly
assigned to receive one of the following intervention schedules over 12
weeks: a three-module intervention delivered monthly, a three-module
intervention delivered weekly or a single module intervention.
Engagement with the website (number of logins, time on site, modules
viewed, action plans completed) was measured using tracking software.
Other outcomes (website acceptability, physical activity behaviour) were
assessed using online surveys. Physical activity outcomes were analysed
using regression models for both study completers and when applying
intention-to-treat (using multiple imputation).
Completers allocated to the monthly module group rated the intervention
higher (b = 2.2 95 \% CI = 0.02-4.53) on acceptability and had higher
levels of resistance-training (IRR = 1.88, 95 \% CI = 1.16-3.04) than
those in the single module group. When accounting for missing data,
these differences were no longer significant. The completion of at least
two action plans was higher among those allocated to the monthly module
group compared to those in the weekly module group (53 vs 40 \%, p =
0.02); though the completion of at least two modules was higher in the
weekly module group compared to the monthly module group (60 vs 46 \%; p
= 0.01). There were no other significant between group differences
observed.
This study provides preliminary evidence that web-based
computer-tailored interventions can be used to increase physical
activity among breast cancer survivors. Further, there were some outcome
differences based on how the tailored modules were delivered, with the
most favourable outcomes observed in the monthly delivery group.
This study will be useful for informing the design of future web-based
interventions targeting breast cancer survivors.},

 abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to describe what is known
about HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases, infection
transmission routes, care, and sources of information, from the
viewpoint of men having sex with men.
Methods: National data (n = 2,072) was collected from June to August
2010 in Finland as part of a joint internetbased survey conducted in 38
countries (EMIS, European MSM Internet Sex Survey).
Results: The respondents' age, place of residence, highest education and
employment status were statistically significantly related to how often
the respondent sought information on HIV, testing and treatments, and
what they knew about infection transmission routes. The respondents'
information seeking behavior was not seen as active regarding HIV
infection and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Conclusions: We should also consider the possibility of using
internet-based interventions, especially in smaller and northern
catchment areas, in order to improve the knowledge level of men having
sex with men.},

 abstract = {Objective: The traditional Mediterranean diet includes high consumption
of fruits, vegetables, olive oil, legumes, cereals and nuts, moderate to
high intake of fish and dairy products, and low consumption of meat
products. Intervention effects to improve adoption of this diet may vary
in terms of individuals' motivational or volitional prerequisites. In
the context of a three-country research collaboration, intervention
effects on these psychological constructs for increasing adoption of the
Mediterranean diet were examined.
Design: An intervention was conducted to improve Mediterranean diet
consumption with a two-month follow-up. Linear multiple-level models
examined which psychological constructs (outcome expectancies, planning,
action control and stage of change) were associated with changes in diet
scores.
Setting: Web-based intervention in Italy, Spain and Greece.
Subjects: Adults (n 454; mean age 422 (sd 104) years, range 18-65 years;
n 112 at follow-up).
Results: Analyses yielded an overall increase in the Mediterranean diet
scores. Moreover, there were interactions between time and all four
psychological constructs on these changes. Participants with lower
levels of baseline outcome expectancies, planning, action control and
stage of change were found to show steeper slopes, thus greater
behavioural adoption, than those who started out with higher levels.
Conclusions: The intervention produced overall improvements in
Mediterranean diet consumption, with outcome expectancies, planning,
action control and stage of change operating as moderators, indicating
that those with lower motivational or volitional prerequisites gained
more from the online intervention. Individual differences in
participants' readiness for change need to be taken into account to
gauge who would benefit most from the given treatment.},

@article{WOS:000401440100008,
 abstract = {Background: Good communication around cancer treatment is essential in
helping patients cope with their disease and related care, especially
when this information is tailored to one's needs. Despite its
importance, communication is often complex, in particular in older
patients (aged 65 years or older). In addition to the age-related
deterioration in information and memory processing older patients
experience, communication is also complicated by their required yet
often unmet role of being an active, participatory patient. Older
patients rarely express their informational needs and their
contributions to consultations are often limited. Therefore, older
patients with cancer need to be prepared to participate more actively in
their care and treatment.
Objective: The objective of this paper was to report the development of
PatientVOICE, an online, preparatory tool with audio facility aimed to
enhance the participation of older patients during educational nursing
encounters preceding chemotherapy and to improve their information
recall.
Methods: PatientVOICE was developed by applying the following 6 steps of
the intervention mapping framework that involved both patients and
nurses: (1) needs assessment, (2) specifying determinants and change
objectives, (3) reviewing and selecting theoretical methods and
practical strategies, (4) developing intervention components, (5)
designing adoption and implementation, and (6) making an evaluation
plan.
Results: A careful execution of these consecutive steps resulted in the
ready-to-use preparatory website. PatientVOICE provides pre-visit
information about chemotherapy (ie, medical information, side effects,
and recommendations of dealing with side effects), information about the
educational nursing visit preceding chemotherapy (ie, aim, structure,
and recommendations for preparation), techniques to improve patients'
communication skills using a question prompt sheet (QPS) and
video-modeling examples showing ``best practices{''}, and the
opportunity to upload and listen back to an audio recording of a
patient's own nursing visit.
Conclusions: The development process resulted in PatientVOICE, a
multi-component online intervention targeted to older patients with
cancer. PatientVOICE contains information about the treatment as well as
information about the role of the patient during treatment. Using
different methods (QPS and audio facility), we hope to support these
patients during their treatment. In the future, the utility and
usability of this complex intervention will be evaluated in a group of
older patients who receive or have received chemotherapy.},

feedback, targeted alerts and virtual assistants. Previous research has
shown that interactive features in eHealth applications tend to improve
user engagement and retention. However, there are no frameworks that
classify levels of user interactivity in eHealth. We propose a novel
taxonomy that ranges from static (non-interactive) to collaborative
(social media) to consultative (telemedicine). This taxonomy is a useful

 abstract = {A growing number of instruments measuring diabetes-specific
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have been identified in previous
systematic reviews, the most recent being published in 2008. The purpose
of this paper is report on an updated systematic review of
diabetes-specific HRQOL measures highlighting the time period 2006-2016;
to deconstruct existing diabetes-specific HRQOL measures into a simple
framework for evaluating the goodness-of-fit between specific research
needs and instrument characteristics; and to present core
characteristics of measures not yet reported in other reviews to further
facilitate scale selection. Using the databases Medline, Pubmed, CINAHL,
OVID Embase, and PsycINFO, we identified 20 diabetes-specific HRQOL
measures that met our inclusion criteria. For each measure, we extracted
eight core characteristics for our measurement selection framework.
These characteristics include target population (type 1 vs. type 2),
number and type of HRQOL dimensions measured and scored, type of score
and calculation algorithm, sensitivity to change data reported in
subsequent studies, number of survey items, approximate time length to
complete, number of studies using the instrument in the past 10 years,
and specific languages instruments is translated. This report provides a
way to compare and contrast existing diabetes-specific HRQOL measures to
aid in appropriate scale selection and utilization. (C) 2016 Elsevier

 abstract = {Background: Core needle biopsy is a reliable diagnostic test for breast
cancer. Although this procedure is a reliable diagnosis tool that can
improve chances of successful treatment and survival, it can be
associated with pain and anxiety. In this context, a mobile health
intervention (BIO H-App) has been developed to address patients'
symptoms of pain and anxiety through a relaxation exercise. In order to
reduce patients' burden, the intervention was designed to be delivered
through mobile devices (e.g., tablets, smartphones).
Aims: To conduct a pilot study in order to obtain usability data and to
assess users' satisfaction with the BIO H-App intervention.
Method: Participants (N = 16, mean age=42.43), were recruited online.
The study consisted of three steps: 1) the online pre-test survey, 2)
use of the BIO H-App, and 3) a post-test survey.
Results: Participants found the intervention component to be useful and
a majority of them (75\%) declared they would recommend the application
to a patient. All tasks were completed successfully and participants
were satisfied with the intervention.
Conclusions: Although its efficacy needs to be evaluated, BIO-H App is a
promising intervention considering users' satisfaction with it and its
ease of use.},

 abstract = {Purpose of review
This review describes recent literature on novel ways technology is used
for assessment of illicit drug use and HIV risk behaviours, suggestions
for optimizing intervention acceptability, and recently completed and
ongoing technology-based interventions for drug-using persons at risk
for HIV and others with high rates of drug use and HIV risk behaviour.
Recent findings
Among studies (n=5) comparing technology-based to traditional assessment
methods, those using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) had high
rates of reported drug use and high concordance with traditional
assessment methods. The two recent studies assessing the acceptability
of mHealth approaches overall demonstrate high interest in these
approaches. Current or in-progress technology-based interventions (n=8)
are delivered using mobile apps (n=5), text messaging (n=2) and
computers (n=1). Most intervention studies are in progress or do not
report intervention outcomes; the results from one efficacy trial showed
significantly higher HIV testing rates among persons in need of drug
treatment.
Summary
Studies are needed to continually assess technology adoption and
intervention preferences among drug-using populations to ensure that
interventions are appropriately matched to users. Large-scale
technology-based intervention trials to assess the efficacy of these
approaches, as well as the impact of individual intervention components,
on drug use and other high-risk behaviours are recommended.},

 abstract = {Self-tracking consists of recording the behaviors that occur in one's
daily life. Self-tracking studies can provide researchers with passively
sensed information about individual's daily behaviors and environments
and actively logged information (e.g., self-reports). This method has
great promise for obtaining detailed records of behavior in naturalistic
contexts, but it is not known what factors would motivate individuals to
participate in self-tracking studies. Here, we analyze students'
interest in self-tracking and their compliance with self-tracking using
smartphones. Three dimensions of self-tracking motivations were
identified: productivity and health behaviors, well-being and daily
activities, and social life on campus; these motivations were related to
participation preferences and individual characteristics. We also
present evidence from three studies that suggest personalized feedback
combined with other incentives (course credit toward a class assignment,
monetary compensation, or a prize reward) can be an effective
recruitment strategy. Recommendations for the design of future
self-tracking studies are presented.},

 abstract = {The digital age presents particular challenges to maintaining
mindfulness, which has, in turn, has been proposed as a corrective agent
to various negative consequences of habitual phone use. This study
examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an
app-based intervention called Mindful Messaging, which was developed to
increase overall mindfulness as well as mindfulness related to
technology use and during text-based interactions. In a sample of 29
young adults, the use of Mindful Messaging resulted in a statistically
significant increase in self-reported mindfulness and statistically
significant decreases in drunk texting, texting while walking, and
having accidents while walking and texting at follow-up relative to
baseline. Effects of medium size were observed across outcomes (Cohen's
d ranged from 0.30 to 0.45). Non-significant reductions were also
observed for emotional regulation difficulties, sexting and texting
while driving, with small effect sizes. Participants' use of an
in-the-moment intervention for composing messages revealed that in
comparison to pre-intervention texts, post-intervention texts conveyed
increased honesty, vulnerability, self-awareness, empathy,
perspective-taking, and concern about the recipient's feelings. Feedback
suggested the app was highly acceptable to users. Findings point to the
potential health benefits of developing mobile interventions which
induce mindfulness related to texting and other technology use.},

 abstract = {Background: Technology-delivered interventions are useful tools for
addressing unhealthy alcohol use. Smartphones in particular offer
opportunities to deliver interventions at the user's convenience. A
smartphone application with 5 modules (personal feedback,
self-monitoring of drinking, designated driver tool, blood alcohol
content {[}BAC] calculator, information) was developed. Its
acceptability and associations between use and drinking outcomes were
assessed. Methods: One hundred thirty adults with unhealthy alcohol use
(>14 {[}men]/>7 {[}women] drinks/week or >= 1 episode/month with 6 or
more drinks) recruited in Switzerland (n = 70) and Canada (n = 60) were
offered to use the application. Follow-up occurred after 3 months.
Appreciation, usefulness, and self-reported frequency of use of the
modules, and drinking outcomes (drinks/week, binge drinking) were
assessed. Associations between application use and drinking at 3 months
were evaluated with negative binomial and logistic regression models,
adjusted for baseline values and gender. Results: Of the participants,
48\% were women, mean (SD) age: 32.8 (10.0). Follow-up rate: 86.2\%.
There were changes from baseline (BL) to follow-up (FU) in number of
drinks/week, BL: 15.0 (16.5); FU: 10.9 (10.5), P = .01, and binge
drinking, BL: 95.4\%; FU: 64.3\%, P < .0001. All modules had median
ratings between 6 and 8 (scale of 1-10). Among the participants, 77\%
used the application, 76\% used the personal feedback module, 41\% the
self-monitoring of drinking, 22\% the designated driver tool, 53\% the
BAC calculator, and 31\% the information module. Participants using the
application more than once reported significantly fewer drinks/week at
follow-up: Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR), number of drinks per week = 0.70
(0.51; 0.96). Conclusions: A smartphone application for unhealthy
alcohol use appears acceptable and useful (although there is room for
improvement). Without prompting, its use is infrequent. Those who used
the application more than once reported less weekly drinking than those
who did not. Efficacy of the application should be tested in a
randomized trial with strategies to increase frequency of its use.},

 abstract = {Objectives: Initial studies indicate more independent and consolidated
sleep in the first few months in infants who sleep separately. Little is
known, however, about the relationship of sleep location (separate room,
room-sharing, bed-sharing) with sleep outcomes in older infants (ages
6-12 months). It was expected that those who sleep in a separate room
would have better parent-perceived sleep outcomes and more positive
sleep health behaviors.
Methods: Parents of 6236 infants (6-12 months) in the United States (US)
and 3798 in an international sample (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Great
Britain, and New Zealand) completed a smartphone app-based expanded
version of the validated Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire.
Results: A total of 37.2\% of the infants in the US and 48.4\% in the
international sample slept in a separate room. In both samples, infants
who slept in a separate room as opposed to room-sharing or bed-sharing
had parent-perceived sleep outcomes and sleep-related behaviors that
reflected earlier bedtimes, shorter time to fall asleep, more nighttime
and total sleep, and increased sleep consolidation. They were also more
likely to have a consistent bedtime routine and to fall asleep
independently, as well as less likely to feed to sleep at bedtime and
during the night. In addition, parents of separate room sleepers
perceived bedtime to be less difficult and sleep to be better overall.
Conclusions: Overall, 6- to 12-month-old infants who slept in a separate
room had better reported sleep outcomes and fewer parent-perceived
disturbances at bedtime than infants who room-shared with their parents,
as well compared to those who slept in their parents' bed. (C) 2017

 abstract = {Research attempting to elucidate physical activity (PA)
intention-behavior relations has focused on differences in long-term
behavior forecasting between people. However, regular PA requires a
repeated performance on a daily or within-daily basis. An empirical case
study application is presented using intensive longitudinal data from a
study of PA in adults to (a) describe the extent to which shortterm
intention-behavior coupling occurs and (b) explore time-varying
predictors of intention formation and shortterm intention-behavior
coupling. Adults (n = 116) participated in three 4-day waves of
ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Each day, participants received
EMA questionnaires assessing short-term PA intentions and wore
accelerometers to assess whether they engaged in = 10 min of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in the 3-hour period after
each EMA prompt. Concurrent affective states and contexts were also
assessed through EMA. Participants reported having short-term intentions
to engage in PA in 41\% of EMA prompts. However, participants only
engaged in = 10 min of MVPA following 16\% of the prompts that
short-term PA intentions were reported indicating an intention-behavior
gap of 84\%. Odds of intentions followed by PA were greater on occasions
when individuals reported higher levels of positive affect than was
typical for them. This study is the first to take an EMA approach to
describe short-term intentionbehavior coupling in adults. Results
suggest that adults have difficulty translating intentions into behavior
at the momentary level, more so than over longer timescales, and that
positive affect may be a key to successfully translating intentions into
behavior.},

 abstract = {Increasing physical activity in people with depression may have the dual
benefit of targeting mental and physical health outcomes (Faulkner \&
Taylor, 2012). This paper describes the development and theoretical
framework for a web-based behavioural activation (BA) intervention,
which specifically promotes physical activity (eMotion). The Centre for
eHealth Research and Disease Management (CeHReS) road map (van
Gemert-Pijnen et al., 2011) was used to guide the process of adapting an
existing face to face intervention based on BA and physical activity
(BAcPAc) (Farrand et al., 2014) to be used in an online context. The
CeHReS roadmap promotes active stakeholder involvement and helped to
ensure that key user needs were being catered to along the developmental
process. Details about the background of the intervention are provided,
including the theoretical framework. A detailed description of how
eMotion was operationalised (in line with TIDieR guidelines (Hoffmann et
al., 2014)) is also provided. eMotion aims to offer person-centred
support through optimising engagement in web-based support, building on
the previous BAcPAc trial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Objective: Adolescent farmworkers are exposed to loud noise during farm
activities. We present a prospective study that evaluated the efficacy
of low-cost, technology-based intervention approaches in high schools to
enhance the use of hearing protection among adolescent farmworkers.
Design: Six high schools in Iowa that agreed to participate in the study
were divided into three equal groups through cluster-randomisation with
each group receiving one of the three formats of hearing protection
intervention: (a) classroom training, (b) classroom training coupled
with smartphone app training and (c) computer training. Participants
completed baseline (pre-training) and six-week post-intervention surveys
for assessing hearing protection knowledge, attitudes and behaviour.
Study Sample: Seventy participants from six schools were initially
enrolled but 50 completed both pre- and post-intervention surveys.
Results: In most cases, all three groups showed significant improvement
in hearing protection knowledge, attitude and frequency of use from pre-
to post-intervention. However, changes between groups were statistically
non-significant. Conclusions: Although all three formats led to
improvements on hearing protection knowledge, attitude and behaviour,
the findings of the study, perhaps due to the small sample size, did not
allow us to detect whether technology-based hearing protection
interventions were more effective than the traditional face-to-face
training for adolescent farmworkers.},

 abstract = {Background: Smartphone-based disease management has become increasingly
interesting for research in the field of bipolar disorders. This article
investigates the attitudes of persons affected by this disorder towards
the appropriation of mobile apps or assistance systems for the
management of their disease.
Methods: We conducted two separate studies. Study 1 was an online survey
with 88 participants. In study 2 we consulted 15 participants during a
semi-structured interview. All the participants had formerly been
diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Results: More than half of the participants of study 1 and most
participants of study 2 agreed with the use of an app or assistance
system for self-ratings, third party ratings and an objective symptom
monitoring. Potential interventions that were popular in both groups
included a regular feedback, the visualization of monitored data and
advice in crises.
Limitations: With study 1 we were not able to ensure correct diagnoses
or to interact in a flexible way. In Study 2 those issues were resolved,
but the small number of participants raises the question of a possible
generalisability of the results. Furthermore, for both studies a
selection bias could not be excluded.
Conclusions: Our results indicate positive attitudes of bipolar patients
towards disease management apps and assistance systems. Even new and
innovative features such as partner apps or the analysis of facial
expressions in video data were appreciated and daily interactions were
favoured. However, the variety of answers calls for flexible systems
which allow activating or deactivating certain features.},

 abstract = {Mobile Health (mHealth) has been piloted in developing countries to
transform the delivery of healthcare services. Despite this heightened
focus on mHealth, the number of fully operational mHealth solutions
implemented in these locations remains surprisingly low. To extend
mHealth projects beyond pilot stage it is imperative that the primary
end user is positively predisposed to engaging with the mHealth
intervention. Through exploring initial perceptions, we can inform later
stages of mHealth projects or develop interventions to convert attitudes
into commitment or motivation to use mHealth. This qualitative
exploratory study aims to understand end users', namely Primary
Healthcare (PHC) workers, initial attitudes towards a mHealth project
called IMPACT (using Mobile Phones for Assessing, Classifying and
Treating sick children). We conducted a field study in Enugu State,
Nigeria to understand end users' perceptions of the relevance, benefits,
threats and initial understanding of the technology influencing end
users' attitudes towards adoption of mHealth. The initial findings
indicate that PHC workers expressed positive perceptions regarding the
relevance and benefits associated with the IMPACT app. PHC workers focus
on how the technology could support them to be more efficient and
effective in their roles. However, they advocate the need for community
wide education and training to eradicate negative perceptions or
misgivings about the potential use of mHealth as part of a patient's
assessment. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Occupational e-mental-health (OEMH) may extend existing instruments for
preservation or restoration of health and work ability. As a key
precondition to efficient implementation, this study examined acceptance
and person-centered barriers to potential uptake of OEMH for
work-related distress in employees with an elevated risk of early
retirement.
Within the framework of the ``Third German Sociomedical Panel of
Employees{''}, 1829 employees with prior sickness absence payments
filled out a self-administered questionnaire. Participants had a mean
age of 49.93 years (SD = 4.06). 6.2\% indicated prior use of eHealth
interventions. Potential predictors of acceptance of OEMH were examined
based on the ``Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology{''}
(UTAUT) extended by work ability, mental health, eHealth literacy and
demographic characteristics.
89.1\% (n = 1579) showed low to moderate acceptance (M = 2.20, SD =
1.05, range 1-5). A path analysis revealed significant, positive direct
effects of UTAUT predictors on acceptance (performance expectancy: 0.48,
SE = 0.02, p < 0.001; effort expectancy: 0.20, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001;
social influence: 0.28, SE = 0.02, p < 0.001).Online time and frequency
of online health information search were further positive direct
predictors of acceptance. Model fit was good {[}chi (2)(7) = 12.91, p =
0.07, RMSEA = 0.02, CFI = 1.00, TLI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.01].
Attitudes towards OEMH are rather disadvantageous in the studied risk
group. Implementation of OEMH, therefore, requires a-priori education
including promotion of awareness, favorable attitudes regarding efficacy
and usability in a collaborative approach.},

and prosocial behavior. Here, we discuss empathic concern, its relation
to altruistic motivation, and how empathic concern is invoked in
experimental studies. We do this with an eye toward applying laboratory
techniques in the classroom, and everyday life, to foster empathic
concern and altruistic responding. This goes beyond teaching about
empathic concern to setting up conditions that help people experience
this psychological state, and its benefits, firsthand. Smartphone-based
ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) can help us do this by raising
self-and other-awareness, and by promoting empathic states and practices
in daily life. While smartphones often pull us away from direct personal
interaction, we explore ways of using these devices to redirect our
attention to those around us. We end by suggesting that these ways of
helping people regularly experience and act upon empathic concern in
daily life might help nurture a compassionate disposition.},

@article{WOS:000434111600001,
 abstract = {Background: Unrestricted by time and place, electronic health (eHealth)
provides solutions for patient empowerment and value-based health care.
Women in the reproductive age are particularly frequent users of
internet, social media, and smartphone apps. Therefore, the pregnant
patient seems to be a prime candidate for eHealth-supported health care
with telemedicine for fetal and maternal conditions.
Objective: This study aims to review the current literature on eHealth
developments in pregnancy to assess this new generation of perinatal
care.
Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search of studies on
eHealth technology in perinatal care in PubMed and EMBASE in June 2017.
Studies reporting the use of eHealth during prenatal, perinatal, and
postnatal care were included. Given the heterogeneity in study methods,
used technologies, and outcome measurements, results were analyzed and
presented in a narrative overview of the literature.
Results: The literature search provided 71 studies of interest. These
studies were categorized in 6 domains: information and eHealth use,
lifestyle (gestational weight gain, exercise, and smoking cessation),
gestational diabetes, mental health, low-and middle-income countries,
and telemonitoring and teleconsulting. Most studies in gestational
diabetes and mental health show that eHealth applications are good
alternatives to standard practice. Examples are interactive blood
glucose management with remote care using smartphones, telephone
screening for postnatal depression, and Web-based cognitive behavioral
therapy. Apps and exercise programs show a direction toward less
gestational weight gain, increase in step count, and increase in smoking
abstinence. Multiple studies describe novel systems to enable home fetal
monitoring with cardiotocography and uterine activity. However, only few
studies assess outcomes in terms of fetal monitoring safety and efficacy
in high-risk pregnancy. Patients and clinicians report good overall
satisfaction with new strategies that enable the shift from
hospital-centered to patient-centered care.
Conclusions: This review showed that eHealth interventions have a very
broad, multilevel field of application focused on perinatal care in all
its aspects. Most of the reviewed 71 articles were published after 2013,
suggesting this novel type of care is an important topic of clinical and
scientific relevance. Despite the promising preliminary results as
presented, we accentuate the need for evidence for health outcomes,
patient satisfaction, and the impact on costs of the possibilities of
eHealth interventions in perinatal care. In general, the combination of
increased patient empowerment and home pregnancy care could lead to more
satisfaction and efficiency. Despite the challenges of privacy,
liability, and costs, eHealth is very likely to disperse globally in the
next decade, and it has the potential to deliver a revolution in
perinatal care.},

 abstract = {Depressive disorders cover a set of disabling problems, often chronic or
recurrent. They are characterized by a high level of psychiatric and
somatic comorbidities and represent an important public health problem.
To date, therapeutic solutions remain unsatisfactory. For some
researchers, this is a sign of decisive paradigmatic failure due to the
way in which disorders are conceptualized. They hypothesize that the
symptoms of a categorical disorder, or of different comorbid disorders,
can be interwoven in chains of interdependencies on different elements,
of which it would be possible to act independently and synergistically
to influence the functioning of the symptom system, rather than limiting
oneself to targeting a hypothetical single underlying cause. New
connected technologies make it possible to invent new observation and
intervention tools allowing better phenotypic characterization of
disorders and their evolution, that fit particularly well into this new
``symptoms network{''} paradigm. Synergies are possible and desirable
between these technological and epistemological innovations and can
possibly help to solve some of the difficult problems people with mental
disorders face in their everyday life, as we will show through a
fictional case study exploring the possibilities of connected
technologies in mental disorders in the near future.},

 abstract = {Aim: To describe the systematic development of an evidence-based,
tailored, interactive web application for self-management of
work-related stress, and to test usability issues regarding how to
proceed through the programme.Methods: Evidence from the fields of
stress management, behaviour change and web-based interventions was the
foundation for the theoretical framework and content. The next step was
the development process of the web application and validation among
experts and one possible end user. Last, a usability test with 14
possible end users was conducted.Results: The web-application, My Stress
Control (MSC), was built on a solid theoretical framework. It consists
of 12 modules including: introduction, psychoeducation, ambivalence,
stress management strategies, lifestyle change, and maintenance.
Self-monitoring, goal-setting, re-evaluating goals, feedback, and
prompting formulation of intention to change are central techniques
supporting behaviour change. The usability test revealed difficulties in
understanding how to proceed through the programme.Conclusion: The
development contributes to filling a gap in the literature regarding
development of complex web-based interventions. MSC is dissimilar to
existing programs in the field, considering the tailoring and
multi-tracked opportunities. Although developed from the evidence in
multiple fields, the web application would benefit from further
development to support users in reaching the end module.},

@article{WOS:000438349400001,
 abstract = {Background: Web-based interventions are becoming an alternative of
treatment aimed to support behavioral changes and several advantages
over traditional treatments are reported. New ways of delivering an
intervention may result in new challenges regarding monitoring of
treatment fidelity (TF) which is essential to ensure internal and
external validity. Despite the importance of the theme, only a few
studies in this field are reported.
Objective: To examine TF of a mobile phone delivered intervention based
on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) with electronic diaries and
written situational feedback for persons with diabetes mellitus type 2,
the recommendations from the Behavior Change Consortium (BCC)
established by The National Institutes of Health (NHI) were applied. To
analyze fidelity, they recommend 5 areas to be investigated (1) design
of the study, (2) provider training, (3) delivery of treatment, (4)
receipt of treatment, and (5) enactment of treatment. In the current
study, these areas were examined based on the analysis of therapists'
adherence to the treatment protocol and participants' and therapists'
experience with the intervention.
Methods: To investigate the therapists' adherence to the treatment
protocol, a total of 251 written feedback text messages were divided
into text segments. Qualitative thematic analyses were then performed to
examine how ACT and other therapeutic processes were used in the
feedback by the therapists. For the therapists' and participants'
experience analysis, participants answered a self-reported questionnaire
and participated in 2 interviews. The therapists continuously reported
their experiences to the researcher responsible for the project.
Results: The results show high adherence to the TF strategies 20/21
(95\%) applicable items of the fidelity checklist recommended by NHI BCC
were identified in the present study. Measured provider skill
acquisition post-training was the only item absent in the fidelity
checklist. The results also show high therapists' adherence to the
treatment protocol. All ACT processes (values, committed action,
acceptance, contact with the present moment, self as context and
cognitive defusion) were found in the coded text segments of the
feedback in addition to communication and motivation strategies. For
336/730 (46\%) of total possible text segments coded independently by 2
researchers, the interrater reliability measured by Cohen's kappa
was.85. The evaluation of participants' and therapists' experience with
the intervention was generally positive.
Conclusions: Based on the analyses of therapists' adherence to the
treatment protocol grounded by ACT-principles and participants' and
therapists' experience with the intervention, the 5 areas of TF
recommended by NHI BCC were analyzed indicating a high level of TF.
These results ensure an appropriate level of internal and external
validity of the study and reliable intervention results and facilitate a
precise replication of this intervention concept. Web-based
psychological interventions to support people with chronic conditions
are becoming increasingly more common. This study supports the results
from a previous study which indicated that ACT could be reliably
delivered in a written web-based format.},

 abstract = {Timely treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is not always available
for rural women, because the local medical resources are insufficient.
The efficacy of remote intervention by smartphone on PMS has not been
confirmed.
A retrospective analysis was performed on rural PMS patients between
January 2014 and December 2015. After a propensity score matched
analysis, 60 patients were enrolled and evenly divided into remote group
and outpatient group. Multidisciplinary therapy including
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), oral medication, and physical
exercise education was used individually, in accordance with their
symptoms evaluated by Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP)
questionnaire. Patients in remote group utilized WeChat software by
smartphone for therapy guidance, while those in outpatient group
attended face-to-face interview. Their DRSP scores in 5 new menstrual
cycles after therapy were recorded. Then, they were followed up for 1
year.
Total DRSP scores of the cases in both groups after initial intervention
were less than those before therapy (P<.001), without group difference
(P>.05). However, patients in remote group indicated a higher
satisfactory rate than the outpatient group (P=.03). On the 1-year
follow up, patients in both groups demonstrated similar DRSP scores
(P=.07), but the satisfactory rate in remote group was encouragingly
higher than that in the outpatient group (P=.02).
The efficacy of remote intervention using smartphone on PMS is
noninferior to traditional outpatient visits. Nevertheless, high-quality
trials are needed.},

 abstract = {Objective: Perseverative cognition (e.g. worry) and unconscious stress
are suggested to be important mediators in the relation between
stressors and physiological health. We examined whether a
smartphone-based worry-reduction training improved a physiological
marker of stress (i.e. increased heart rate variability {[}HRV]) and
unconscious stress.Design: Randomised-controlled trial was conducted
with individuals reporting work stress (n=136). Participants were
randomised to the experimental, control or waitlist condition (resp. EC,
CC, WL). The EC and CC registered emotions five times daily for
fourweeks. The EC additionally received a worry-reduction training with
mindfulness exercises.Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was 24-h
assessments of HRV measured at pre-, mid- and post-intervention.
Secondary outcomes were implicit affect and stress. Effects on heart
rate and other psychological outcomes were explored.Results: A total of
118 participants completed the study. No change from pre- to
post-intervention was observed for the primary or secondary outcomes.
The change over time was not different between conditions.Conclusion:
Findings suggest that the training was ineffective for improving HRV or
psychological stress. Future studies may focus on alternative
smartphone-based stress interventions, as stress levels are high in
society. There is need for easy interventions and smartphones offer
possibilities for this.},

 abstract = {Background: This study investigated the determinants (with a special
emphasis on the role of diabetes app use, use of continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) device, and self-care behavior) of glycemic control of
type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: A web-based survey
was conducted using diabetes Facebook groups, online patient-forums, and
targeted Facebook advertisements (ads). Demographic, CGM, diabetes app
use, and self-care behavior data were collected. Glycemic level data
were categorized into hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and good control.
Multinomial logistic regression stratified by diabetes type was
performed. Results: The survey URL was posted in 78 Facebook groups and
eight online forums, and ten targeted Facebook ads were conducted
yielding 1854 responses. Of those owning smartphones (n = 1753, 95\%),
1052 (62.6\%) had type 1 and 630 (37.4\%) had type 2 DM. More than half
of the type 1 respondents (n = 549, 52.2\%) and one third the
respondents with type 2 DM (n = 210, 33.3\%) reported using diabetes
apps. Increased odds of experiencing hyperglycemia were noted in persons
with type 1 DM with lower educational status (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR)
= 1.7; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.21-2.39); smokers (1.63, 95\%
CI: 1.15-2.32), and high diabetes self-management concern (AOR = 2.09,
95\% CI: 1.15-2.32). CGM use (AOR = 0.66, 95\% CI: 0.44-1.00); general
diet (AOR = 0.86, 95\% CI: 0.79-0.94); and blood glucose monitoring (AOR
= 0.88, 95\%CI: 0.80-0.97) self-care behavior reduced the odds of
experiencing hyperglycemia. Hypoglycemia in type 1 DM was reduced by
using CGM (AOR = 0.24, 95\% CI: 0.09-0.60), while it was increased by
experiencing a high diabetes self-management concern (AOR = 1.94, 95\%
CI: 1.04-3.61). Hyperglycemia in type 2 DM was increased by age (OR =
1.02, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.04); high self-management concern (AOR = 2.59,
95\% CI: 1.74-3.84); and poor confidence in self-management capacity
(AOR = 3.22, 2.07-5.00). Conversely, diabetes app use (AOR = 0.63, 95\%
CI: 0.41-0.96) and general diet self-care (AOR = 0.84, 95\% CI:
0.75-0.94), were significantly associated with the reduced odds of
hyperglycemia. Conclusion: Diabetes apps, CGM, and educational
interventions aimed at reducing self-management concerns and enhancing
dietary self-care behavior and self-management confidence may help
patients with diabetes to improve glycemic control.},

 abstract = {Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are websites, software,
mobile apps, and sensors designed to help users address or change
behaviors, cognitions, and emotional states. BITs have the potential to
transform health care delivery, and early research has produced
promising findings of efficacy. BITs also favor new models of health
care delivery and provide novel data sources for measurement. However,
there are few examples of successful BIT implementation and a lack of
consensus on as well as inadequate descriptions of BIT implementation
measurement. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview
and characterization of implementation outcomes for the study of BIT use
in routine practice settings. Eight outcomes for the evaluation of
implementation have been previously described: acceptability, adoption,
appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost,
penetration, and sustainability. In a proposed recharacterization of
these outcomes with respect to BIT implementation, definitions are
clarified, expansions to the level of analysis are identified, and
unique measurement characteristics are discussed. Differences between
BIT development and implementation, an increased focus on consumer-level
outcomes, the expansion of providers who support BIT use, and the
blending of BITs with traditional health care services are specifically
discussed. BITs have the potential to transform health care delivery.
Realizing this potential, however, will hinge on high-quality research
that consistently and accurately measures how well such technologies
have been integrated into health services. This overview and
characterization of implementation outcomes support BIT research by
identifying and proposing solutions for key theoretical and practical
measurement challenges.},

 abstract = {The field of digital mental health is rapidly expanding with digital
tools being used in assessment, intervention, and supporting self-help.
The application of digital mental health to hallucinations is, however,
at a very early stage. This report from a working group of the
International Consortium on Hallucinations Research considers particular
synergies between the phenomenon of hallucinations and digital tools
that are being developed. Highlighted uses include monitoring and
managing intermittently occurring hallucinations in daily life;
therapeutic applications of audio and video media including virtual and
augmented reality; targeting verbal aspects of hallucinations; and using
avatars to represent hallucinatory voices. Although there is a
well-established Internet-based peer support network, digital resources
for hallucinations have yet to be implemented in routine practice.
Implementation may benefit from identifying how to market resources to
the broad range of populations who experience hallucinations and
identifying sustainable funding models. It is envisaged that digital
tools will contribute to improved self-management and service provision
for people experiencing hallucinations.},

 abstract = {HIV and sexuality stigma impede HIV prevention and care efforts.
HealthMpowerment.org (HMP) is an interactive mobile phone- and web-based
HIV prevention and care intervention for young Black men who have sex
with men (YBMSM; ages 18-30) in the United States. HMP included three
forums where participants could share their experiences. In this study,
we explored whether engaging in stigma-related discussions was
associated with changes in YBMSM's stigma-related scores throughout the
trial. YBMSM (ages 18-30; N=238) participating in HMP completed surveys
at baseline, and 3 and 6month follow-ups that included a series of
scales focused on HIV and sexuality (internalized homophobia; sexual
prejudice) stigma. Sixty-two participants contributed to the forums
(1497 posts). We coded instances where YBMSM's conversations were stigma
related (915 posts, 61.1\%), including discussions of anticipated
(74/915, 8.1\%), experienced (125/915, 13.7\%), internalized (410/915,
44.8\%), and/or challenged (639/915, 69.8\%) stigma regarding sexuality
and HIV. Using a mixed methods approach, we examined whether changes in
YBMSM's stigma scores were associated with stigma-related discussions
within the forum. We controlled for age, HIV status, income, and
educational attainment in these multivariable models. YBMSM who
discussed experiencing HIV stigma in the forums reported decreases in
perceived HIV stigma over time (b=-0.37, p0.05). YBMSM whose forum posts
indicated anticipated HIV stigma reported increases in HIV stigma over
time (b=0.46, p0.01). Participants who challenged sexuality-related
stigma in forums had lower internalized homophobia (b=-0.68, p0.01) at
baseline. YBMSM whose discussions focused on experiencing
sexuality-related stigma reported increases in internalized homophobia
(b=0.39, p0.01) and sexual prejudice (b=0.87, p0.05) over time.
Developing strategies to combat stigma remains a key priority. HMP
created an online space where YBMSM could discuss HIV and sexuality
stigma. Although a limited number of HMP participants authored the
majority of these forum discussions, the discussions were associated
with changes in the sample's stigma scores over time. Online
interventions (e.g., social media, apps) should consider the inclusion
of forums to address stigma and test the efficacy of forums to improve
YBMSM's HIV prevention and care continuum outcomes.},

 abstract = {There is growing evidence for the efficacy of acceptance and commitment
therapy (ACT) interventions delivered through smartphones, but research
has not yet focused on how to optimize such interventions. One benefit
of mobile interventions is the ability to adapt content based on
in-the-moment variables. The current randomized controlled trial
evaluated whether an ACT app that tailored skill coaching based on
in-the-moment ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) would be more
efficacious than the same app where skill coaching was random or an
EMA-only condition. A sample of 69 adults interested in using a
self-help app were randomized to one of three app conditions and used
the app for the following 4weeks. Results indicated equivalently high
user satisfaction with the tailored versus random apps. Participants
used the EMA-only app the most and the tailored app the least, but
overall adherence was adequate. Participants in the tailored app
improved significantly more on psychological distress and positive
mental health relative to the random app and EMA-only conditions.
However, no differences were found between the random app and EMA-only
conditions on outcomes. Between-group differences over time were also
found on psychological inflexibility, but this appeared to be primarily
due to a lower rate of improvement in the random app condition relative
to both tailored and EMA-only. Overall, these results suggest that
tailoring ACT skill coaching based on in-the-moment variables leads to
greater efficacy.},

 abstract = {Background: Clinical networks have been found to provide benefits such
as better and more standardized patient care and greater satisfaction
for practitioners. In September 2017 the BC Emergency Medicine Network
(EM Network) was launched to help practitioners deliver the best care.
The EM Network's website was developed to provide individual
practitioners with access to clinical resources, research and innovation
initiatives, continuing professional development, and real-time support.
Since surprisingly little is known about how clinical networks are best
structured and developed, the plans for the EM Network included an early
evaluation process to document and guide growth.
Methods: Overall function of the EM Network after 1 year of operation
was evaluated by analyzing membership and online engagement data and by
conducting an online quantitative survey and subsequent qualitative
interviews to obtain member feedback. Google Maps, Google Analytics, and
Twitter Analytics were used, as well as PARTNER (Program to Analyze,
Record, and Track Networks to Enhance Relationships), a validated social
network analysis tool. The BC Ethics Harmonization Initiative advised
that formal ethics approval was not needed because the study fits within
a quality improvement framework.
Results: During the study period, the EM Network consisted of 622 of
1400 eligible members (44\%) from 79 of 108 emergency care sites in BC
(73\%). Each month an average of 999 active users visited the website.
While survey respondents indicated the EM Network is credible and
respected, many were unaware of its purpose and offerings. Averaged
scores for the perceptions of survey respondents regarding three network
values (power/influence, involvement, resource contribution) ranged from
2.36 to 2.52, with 3.00 being considered good. When survey respondents
were asked if they felt supported in their work by the Network, the
majority said they felt ``supported{''} or ``somewhat supported.{''}
Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for early evaluation after
a network is launched to identify development needs. While our results
must be interpreted cautiously because the EM Network is young,
membership and online engagement data and member feedback indicate we
need to increase awareness of offerings and encourage more online
dialogue. Regular re-evaluation is planned to monitor progress and
strengthen this initiative.},

 abstract = {Mental Health America designed ten questionnaires that are used to
determine the risk of mental disorders. They are also commonly used by
Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) to assess suicidality. Specifically,
the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), a widely used
suicide assessment questionnaire, helps MHPs determine the severity of
suicide risk and offer an appropriate treatment. A major challenge in
suicide treatment is the social stigma wherein the patient feels
reluctance in discussing his/her conditions with an MHP, which leads to
inaccurate assessment and treatment of patients. On the other hand, the
same patient is comfortable freely discussing his/her mental health
condition on social media due to the anonymity of platforms such as
Reddit, and the ability to control what, when and how to share.
The popular ``SuicideWatch{''} subreddit has been widely used among
individuals who experience suicidal thoughts, and provides significant
cues for suicidality. The timeliness in sharing thoughts, the
flexibility in describing feelings, and the interoperability in using
medical terminologies make Reddit an important platform to be utilized
as a complementary tool to the conventional healthcare system. As MHPs
develop an implicit weighting scheme over the questionnaire (i.e.,
C-SSRS) to assess suicide risk severity, creating a relative weighting
scheme for answers to be automatically generated to the questions in the
questionnaire poses as a key challenge.
In this interdisciplinary study, we position our approach towards a
solution for an automated suicide risk-elicitation framework through a
novel question answering mechanism. Our two-fold approach benefits from
using: 1) semantic clustering, and 2) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
models. We also generate a gold standard dataset of suicide posts with
their risk levels. This work forms a basis for the next step of building
conversational agents that elicit suicide-related natural conversation
based on questions.},

 abstract = {The explosion of technological applications in health care has provided
new avenues for clinical change to occur. Mobile health (mHealth) apps,
which include clinical tools that run on smartphones, are one such
demonstration of these technologies. Benefits of mHealth apps are
numerous, but potential limitations include poorer understanding of
material due to the lack of real-time support from providers, limited
scope and depth of interventions, and absence of theoretical grounding
and/or empirical support. A potential reason for these limitations is
that treatment experts and app developers lack a common theory-based
conceptual model to inform the objectives of mHealth interventions. We
discuss how clinicians and app developers can use models of learning
processes, such as Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) and Bloom's
Taxonomy, to facilitate collaboration among professionals and to
increase experiential learning within mHealth interventions. First, we
present ELT and Bloom's Taxonomy as frameworks to aid in the development
of mHealth apps for behavioral health. Next, we outline some key
ingredients of experiential learning to consider during the development
stages of mHealth interventions, namely concrete experience,
interactivity, experimentation, scaffolding, and integration (i.e.,
including affective, behavioral, and cognitive elements). Within these
key ingredients, we consider how such factors can enhance outcomes for
mHealth apps through processes such as engagement, shaping of beliefs,
skills development, generalization, and scope of learning.},

increased demand for technology-enabled behavioral health tools among
consumers, little progress has been made in easing the burden of mental
illness. This may be because of the inherent challenges of conducting
traditional clinical trials in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.
Objective: This study sought to validate the effectiveness of Pacifica,
a popular commercially available app for the self-management of
mild-to-moderate stress, anxiety, and depression.
Methods: A total of 500 adults with mild-to-moderate anxiety or
depression were recruited from in-app onboarding to participate in a
randomized waitlist controlled trial of Pacifica. We conducted an
all-virtual study, recruiting, screening, and randomizing participants
through a Web-based participant portal. Study participants used the app
for 1 month, with no level of use required, closely mimicking real-world
app usage. Participants in the waitlist group were given access to the
app after 1 month. Measurements included self-reported symptoms of
stress, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy. We performed an
intent-to-treat analysis to examine the interactive effects of time and
condition.
Results: We found significant interactions between time and group.
Participants in the active condition demonstrated significantly greater
decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress and increases in
self-efficacy. Although we did not find a relationship between overall
engagement with the app and symptom improvement, participants who
completed relatively more thought record exercises sustained
improvements in their symptoms through the 2-month follow-up to a
greater degree than those who completed fewer. In addition, we found
that participants who reported concomitantly taking psychiatric
medications during the trial benefitted less from the app, as measured
by the symptoms of anxiety and stress.
Conclusions: This study provides evidence that Pacifica, a popular
commercially available self-help app, is effective in reducing
self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, particularly
among individuals who utilize thought records and are not taking
psychiatric medication.},

for LGBTIQ+ young people. It reports on data from an Australian study of
LGBTIQ+ young people's mental health help-seeking experiences.
Participants (aged 16-25 years) highlighted the potential value of
mental health apps, yet also questioned the need for another digital
intervention. Addressing stigma around mental health was seen as a
greater priority for many, as was addressing the inadequate mental
health information and support available to LGBTIQ+ young people through
schools and mainstream health services. Participants noted that a mental
health app must not only be useful, reliable and accessible but also
actively sought, which was sometimes unlikely. This article questions a
contemporary public health agenda for developing digital solutions to
complex social problems. Furthermore, it asks whether health inequities
and social stigma can be addressed by apps that typically prioritise the
practice of individualised self-care.},

The qualitative data that inform this study's findings include 88

four institutional barriers that can inhibit widespread adoption of a
promising innovation: (a) the challenge of tapping into participants'
intrinsic motivation; (b) forging opportunities for collaboration and

 abstract = {Background: Children's burn injuries can have a significant psychosocial
impact on parents. However, the stress involved in caring for a child
following a burn can often go unrecognized and does not necessarily
prompt help seeking by parents.
Objective: It is common for adults to seek health-related support and
information via the Internet. Many benefit from immediate and easy
access to online psychological interventions. A prototype burn-specific,
parent-focused, peer-informed, supportive website, designed to provide
easy access to information and psychoeducation, was created and tested
for acceptability.
Patient involvement: Using a partnership-based method of website
development, parents and professionals (clinical, academic and support
organizations) were recruited and their particular expertise was
acknowledged and valued. A participatory action approach was adopted to
determine the acceptability of the website for parents/carers.
Methods: 31 participants (9 parents, 22 professionals) tested a
prototype version of the website. Data was collected using the eHealth
Impact Questionnaire and the concurrent think-aloud protocol.
Results: Parents and professionals had favorable opinions of the
website. Parents' ratings tended to be more favorable than
professionals', which was significant for the information and
presentation. Participants' thoughts were categorized into seven topics:
need, structure/navigation, trust/relevance, language/comprehension,
therapeutic content, mode of delivery, and suggested improvements.
Discussion: Many practical and psychological barriers can prevent
parents of burn-injured children accessing psychosocial support and
contribute to a feeling of isolation. Participants felt that the website
would be a valuable addition to UK pediatric burn care. The existence of
an accessible resource could help to normalize parents' experience of
their child's injury and reduce their perceived isolation, although peer
interaction is not provided by the website.
Practical value: This online resource, hosting information and peers'
personal experiences, offers promising and exciting opportunities to
empower parents whilst providing accessible supportive advice to
encourage self-care and formal/informal support seeking when necessary.

 abstract = {Background HeartSteps is an mHealth intervention that encourages regular
walking via activity suggestions tailored to the individuals' current
context.
Purpose We conducted a micro-randomized trial (MRT) to evaluate the
efficacy of HeartSteps' activity suggestions to optimize the
intervention.
Methods We conducted a 6-week MRT with 44 adults. Contextually tailored
suggestions could be delivered up to five times per day at user-selected
times. At each of these five times, for each participant on each day of
the study, HeartSteps randomized whether to provide an activity
suggestion, and, if so, whether to provide a walking or an antisedentary
suggestion. We used a centered and weighted least squares method to
analyze the effect of suggestions on the 30-min step count following
suggestion randomization.
Results Averaging over study days and types of activity suggestions,
delivering a suggestion versus no suggestion increased the 30-min step
count by 14\% (p = .06), 35 additional steps over the 253-step average.
The effect was not evenly distributed in time. Providing any type of
suggestion versus no suggestion initially increased the step count by
66\% (167 steps; p < .01), but this effect diminished over time.
Averaging over study days, delivering a walking suggestion versus no
suggestion increased the average step count by 24\% (59 steps; p = .02).
This increase was greater at the start of study (107\% or 271 additional
steps; p < .01), but decreased over time. Antisedentary suggestions had
no detectable effect on the 30-min step count.
Conclusion Contextually tailored walking suggestions are a promising way
of initiating bouts of walking throughout the day.
Clinical Trial information This study was registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03225521.
Smartphone-delivered suggestions to be active, tailored to a person's
location, time of day and weather, can help individuals initiate short
bouts of activity throughout the day.},

interventions improved sleep (one out of two RCTs and one out of three
pre/post studies). Text messaging was the most frequently used
intervention (60\% of all studies) but was usually used in combination
with other components (79\% of hybrid interventions included SMS, plus
either web or app components). Although more high-quality RCTs are
needed, there is evidence supporting the effectiveness of mHealth

intervention/preventive interventions for young people identified to be
at risk of bipolar disorder (BD), and digital delivery appears to be a
strong candidate delivery method. To date, no such interventions exist,
and the aim of this perspective paper is to advance the literature by
reviewing theoretical issues related to early intervention in BD and
introducing a framework for design of feasible, acceptable, and
effective online psychosocial interventions for this population. It is
concluded that, by adopting an appropriate transdiagnostic and
humanistic framework, and recognizing emerging tenets of digital
psychotherapy development, testable online interventions for young
people at risk of BD are within reach.},

 abstract = {Background: Loneliness is an emerging issue for young people, but yet
many interventions to address loneliness in this group focus on
providing social opportunities. While these sorts of interventions may
appear to increase social connections, loneliness is more related to
quality rather than quantity of social relationships. Thus,
interventions addressing loneliness should focus on maximizing the
quality of current relationships. Together with youth consumers both
with mental ill health and those without, we developed a digital
smartphone application (app) called +Connect. The 6-week program
delivers positive psychology content designed to improve relationship
quality. We tested the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of the
program in lonely young people with or without a mental health diagnosis
of social anxiety disorder. We used a mixed method study design to
triangulate pilot quantitative and qualitative data in young people with
and without social anxiety disorder (SAD).
Method: Nine participants with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder
(M-age = 21.00; SD = 1.41) and 11 participants with no mental health
conditions (M-age = 20.36; SD = 2.16) completed the +Connect digital
intervention.
Results: Those with social anxiety disorder reported less acceptable
ratings on outcomes. Feasibility ratings, measured by uptake and app
completion, met a priori threshold criteria in both groups. Those with
social anxiety disorder yielded more attrition, with almost double the
attrition rate compared with those without the disorder. There were no
safety issues elicited during the pilot study. In terms of outcomes,
exploratory analyses indicated that the app itself is likely to be
beneficial rather than cause harm. Our qualitative data indicated both
groups reported no negative outcomes and noted that positive outcomes
were driven by three processes: reflection, learning, and real-life
application. Further exploratory data on usability indicated room for
improvement in terms of giving more support for different components of
the app (i.e., challenges).
Conclusion: The pilot findings of this proof-of-concept app indicates
some promise in terms of a second iterative version of +Connect.},

 abstract = {Background: Digital health interventions have potential to contribute to
better health outcomes, better healthcare and lower costs. However,
evidence for their effectiveness is variable. The development and
content of digital health interventions are often not described in
enough detail to enable others to replicate the research or improve on
previous interventions. This has led to a call for transparent reporting
of intervention content and development.
Purpose: To describe the development process and content of a digital
self-management intervention for people with type 2 diabetes
(HeLP-Diabetes) that has been found to achieve its target clinical
outcome, the reduction of HbA1c, a measure of glycaemic control.
Method: We synthesised theory, data from existing research evidence and
international guidelines, and new qualitative data from target users to
identify the determinants of self-management and the content to be
included in HeLP-Diabetes. Using an ongoing iterative participatory
design approach the content of the intervention was written, produced,
reviewed and changed.
Conclusion: It is possible to develop and transparently report
self-management programmes for long-term conditions, which reflect
current best evidence, theoretical underpinning and user involvement. We
intend that reporting the development process and content will inform
future digital intervention development.},

issues tend to be interrelated and reinforced by each other, but this
mutual causality is usually ignored in the existing literature. This
paper provides an unbiased estimate of a structural equation model
taking endogeneity into account. A questionnaire is designed based on
the health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) framework and is given to 322
homeless individuals. Evidence shows that, without timely support, the
homeless state and health state will fast deteriorate and reinforce each
other. It is therefore arguable to broaden the definition of statutory
homelessness, and the ``preventative approach{''} can save, rather than
increase, the public resources spent on the homeless.},

 abstract = {Background: Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia (PD) is a common
psychological disorder. Internet-based interventions have the potential
to offer highly scalable low-threshold evidence-based care to people
suffering from PD. GET.ON Panic is a newly developed internet-based
intervention addressing symptoms of PD. In order to transfer the
training into the daily life of the individuals, we integrated mobile
components in the training and created a so-called hybrid online
training. The development and beta-testing of such a training requires a
novel interdisciplinary approach between IT specialists and
psychologists. From this point of view, we would like to share our
experiences in this exploratory paper.
Methods: This initial feasibility study (N = 10) offers, on the one
hand, a brief overview of the interdisciplinary development phase of the
mobile application and on the other hand, provides first insights into
the usage, usability and acceptance of this mobile application using
qualitative interview data as well quantitative measures of 8 completing
participants. For these reasons, we used a pre-posttest design without a
control group. Furthermore, we present initial clinical outcomes of the
intervention on e.g. panic symptom severity, depressive symptoms as well
additional anxiety measures. Finally, we end with implications for
further research in the relatively new field of mobile mental health.
Results: Overall, usability, user satisfaction, motivational value and
technology acceptance of the app were perceived as high. The usage of
app components was diverse: The use of interoceptive exposure exercises
and daily summaries on anxiety and mood was highest while using in-vivo
exposure exercises and monitoring panic symptoms was perceived as
difficult. Furthermore, participants showed after the training less
clinical symptoms as at baseline-assessment.
Discussion: The current feasibility study contributes to an in-depth
understanding of the potential of mobile technology in e-mental health.
Overall, the GET.ON Panic app appears to be an acceptable and
motivational part of a CBT-based hybrid online training for PD that has
the potential to promote training success. After some suggested
adjustments have been made, the efficacy should be investigated in a
randomized controlled trial.},

appraisal styles (i.e., threat vs. challenge) and feedback types on
feedback acceptance and motivation for challenge. We used four feedback
types based on valence (positive vs. negative) and orientation (person
vs. task). Sixth-graders completed the cognitive appraisal style
questionnaire and wrote an essay on their use of smartphones. One week
after the writing, they received feedback, and their feedback acceptance
and motivation for challenge were measured. Effective feedback types
varied depending on students' appraisal styles. The challenge style
demonstrated the highest feedback acceptance for positive task-oriented
feedback. Negative task-oriented feedback was the most effective for the
threat style. The challenge style showed higher motivation for challenge
when receiving positive task-oriented and negative person-oriented
feedbacks, whereas the threat style did not. Educators should be
encouraged to provide personalized feedback based on students' cognitive
appraisal styles to maximize feedback effects.},

 abstract = {Objectives: Emerging evidence suggests both motivation and
movement-related behaviors vary within and across days. Yet common data
analytic approaches assume static or consistent relationships between
motivation and behavior across time. Just as motivation and behavior
change across time, so too might associations between motivation and
behavior. This study will apply time-varying effect modeling to
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data to examine time of day
differences in how motivational constructs predict older adults'
subsequent movement-related behavior over the next 2 h.
Design: Older adults (n = 104) completed a 10-day EMA protocol.
Method: Participants answered up to 6 EMA prompts/day to assess
momentary intentions and self-efficacy to stand or move as well as
intentions and self-efficacy to limit sedentary time over the next 2 h.
Participants wore an activPAL accelerometer continuously to measure time
spent being upright (i.e., standing or moving) and time spent sitting.
Results: On weekdays, intentions and self-efficacy were generally
predictive of subsequent behavior in the expected direction over the
majority of the day whereas these constructs predicted subsequent
behavior in the expected directions over a smaller range of times on
weekend days.
Conclusions: This study adds to emerging evidence that associations
between motivational constructs and subsequent behavior change over the
course of the day, but these time-varying associations may be different
depending on the day of week. This work has implications for
intervention design and the timing of intervention content delivery in
approaches like just-in-time adaptive interventions.},

 abstract = {(1) Background: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT; online and
face-to-face sessions) seems a promising alternative alongside regular
face-to-face CBT depression treatment in specialized mental health care
organizations. Therapists are key in the uptake of bCBT. This study
focuses on therapists' perspectives on usability, satisfaction, and
factors that promote or hinder the use of bCBT in routine practice; (2)
Methods: Three focus groups (n = 8, n = 7, n = 6) and semi-structured
in-depth interviews (n = 15) were held throughout the Netherlands.
Beforehand, the participating therapists (n = 36) completed online
questionnaires on usability and satisfaction. Interviews were analyzed
by thematic analysis; (3) Results: Therapists found the usability
sufficient and were generally satisfied with providing bCBT. The
thematic analysis showed three main themes on promoting and hindering
factors: (1) therapists' needs regarding bCBT uptake, (2) therapists'
role in motivating patients for bCBT, and (3) therapists' experiences
with bCBT; (4) Conclusions: Overall, therapists were positive; bCBT can
be offered by all CBT-trained therapists and future higher uptake is
expected. Especially the pre-set structure of bCBT was found beneficial
for both therapists and patients. Nevertheless, therapists did not
experience promised time-savings-rather, the opposite. Besides, there
are still teething problems and therapeutic shortcomings that need
improvement in order to motivate therapists to use bCBT.},

 abstract = {Offering participants in mobile app studies personalized feedback on the
data they report seems an obvious thing to do: Participants might expect
an app to provide feedback given their experiences with commercial apps,
feedback might motivate more people to participate in the study, and
participants might be more motivated to provide accurate data so that
the feedback is more useful to them. However, personalized feedback
might lead participants to change the behavior that is being measured
with the app, is costly to implement, and also constrains other design
decisions for the data collection. In this article, we report on an
experimental study that tested the effects of providing personalized
feedback in a 1-month mobile app-based spending study. Based on the app
paradata and responses to a debrief survey, it seems that participants
reacted positively to the feedback. The feedback did not have the
potential negative effect of altering the spending participants reported
in the app. However, the feedback also did not have the intended effect
of increasing initial participation or ongoing adherence to the study

role in addressing these unmet needs. The purpose of this study was to
characterize caregiver burden in those seeking a mobile app for

to participate. The majority reported moderate-to-severe levels of
depression (60\%) and/or caregiver burden (59\%). Relationship quality,
communication, and self-efficacy for caregiving were the strongest
predictors of negative outcomes (p's < .001), and qualitative results
identified several additional unmet needs (e.g. relationship concerns,
safety concerns). This study identifies potential mechanisms by which a
mobile app could improve family functioning in the context of PTSD.},

real-time. This study aimed to develop and test the usability of one of
the first smartphone app-delivered ecological momentary interventions
for gambling (GamblingLess: Curb Your Urge), with key Australian
stakeholders (ten consumers, nine gambling clinicians, and ten gambling
researchers). Based on relapse prevention principles, the intervention
comprised 10 activities to curb cravings, which were recommended to
participants based on ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of
gambling cravings. Participants tested the usability of the intervention
over one-week and reported on the content's helpfulness, the EMA's
relevance/burden, the Mobile App Rating Scale, and open-ended items
assessing content and functionality. The intervention content,
helpfulness, and usability were rated highly in quantitative and
qualitative assessments. Participants liked practical and instructive
content, but suggested that the intervention could be more engaging,
interactive, and varied, and the number of EMA questions per timepoint
could be reduced. These preliminary findings were promising for the
intervention's acceptability and usability. All groups indicated that
they would recommend this app, as it could increase knowledge,
attitudes, awareness, behavior change, intention to change, and
help-seeking for gambling cravings. Further research is required to
refine the intervention and examine its effectiveness with gamblers.},

 abstract = {The need for treatment of common mental health problems such as
depression or anxiety has steadily increased. However, many people still
do not receive effective and timely treatment due to the low
availability, accessibility, and acceptability of traditional
counseling. In this study, we developed a scalable, effective, and
accessible app to address the problems that arise in traditional
face-to-face counseling and to treat common psychological problems such
as mild depression that people experience in their daily lives. The
suggested app features semi-crowdsourced counseling, immediate
intervention from multiple counselors, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
(CBT)-based short comments, and gamification. In a two-week randomized
control trial (RCT), we surveyed 47 college students in their 20 s to
investigate the efficacy of the suggested app and found that depression
levels were reduced significantly only in the experimental group using
the app. In addition, we conducted a user survey to determine which
design factors affected the user experience of clients and counselors
using the app. The proposed app can be used to help those suffering from
mild depression in daily life, and it can also be used as a training aid
to enhance counselors' counseling skills.},

 abstract = {Psychological interventions for addictive behaviours (i.e., alcohol,
smoking, gambling) typically focus on reducing the frequency of that
target behaviour. Individuals generally set a ``count goal{''} and then
monitor the frequency of these behaviours via a process of
counting/recording (i.e., number of alcoholic drinks, number of dollars
gambled). We argue that this approach, although a key feature of
interventions, presents a range of challenges, including: confusion
regarding what constitutes a count; remembering to keep count; and
remembering to stop at a certain count. We argue that these inherent
features of ``count goals{''} may serve to undermine treatment
effectiveness for addictive behaviours and potentially other behaviour
change interventions. Furthermore, given counting of specific behaviours
occurs frequently within digital interventions (e.g., steps, cigarettes,
drinks), these issues may be further exacerbated within mHealth
(interventions delivered through mobile digital devices). In this
article, we offer an alternative to setting ``count goals{''} as part of
a behavioural intervention. This approach directly limits a problem
behaviour by constraining the time period, and rate of that behaviour,
with no requirement to count or record the frequency of the behaviour-we
refer to this as the ``Chronos Approach.{''} We suggest that this
approach lends itself particularly well to mHealth interventions,
whereby daily reminders and timed alerts can be easily programmed into a
smartphone. We discuss the advantages of this method and illustrate how
it can be effectively incorporated into mHealth behaviour interventions,
providing a specific example of an alcohol reduction smartphone app
wherein the Chronos Approach has been implemented.},

 abstract = {Background: The System Usability Scale (SUS) is used to measure
usability of internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT).
However, whether the SUS is a valid instrument to measure usability in
this context is unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the factor
structure of the SUS, measuring usability of iCBT for depression in a
sample of professionals. In addition, the psychometric properties
(reliability, convergent validity) of the SUS were tested.
Methods: A sample of 242 professionals using iCBT for depression from 6
European countries completed the SUS. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
was conducted to test whether a one-factor, two-factor, tone-model or
bi-direct model would fit the data best. Reliability was assessed using
complementary statistical indices (e.g. omega). To assess convergent
validity, the SUS total score was correlated with an adapted Client
Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-3).
Results: CFA supported the one-factor, two-factor and tone-model, but
the bi-factor model fitted the data best (Comparative Fit Index=0.992,
Tucker Lewis Index=0.985, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation=0.055,
Standardized Root Mean Square Residual=0.042 (respectively chi(2)(diff)
(9)=69.82, p < 0.001; chi(2)(diff) (8) (=) 33.04, p < 0.001).
Reliability of the SUS was good (omega=0.91). The total SUS score
correlated moderately with the CSQ-3 (CSQ1 r(s) =.49, p < 0.001; CSQ2
r(s) =.46, p < 0.001; CSQ3 r(s) =.38, p < 0.001), indicating convergent
validity.
Conclusions: Although the SUS seems to have a multidimensional
structure, the best model showed that the total sumscore of the SUS
appears to be a valid and interpretable measure to assess the usability
of internet-based interventions when used by professionals in mental
healthcare.},

 abstract = {Fussy eating and food refusal are common in young children. These
behaviours can contribute to anxiety or concern in parents and
caregivers, who have called for credible support to help them navigate
the challenges of feeding young children. Given recent increases in
technology, and use of the Internet as a trusted source of parenting
support, the Child Feeding Guide digital health intervention was created
to provide evidence-based support to parents and caregivers to help them
to feed children and establish healthy eating habits from the early
years. An evaluation was conducted with 25 mothers (with a child aged 6
months to 4 years) who used the Child Feeding Guide website/app over 4
weeks. Mothers provided information about their feeding practices and
anxiety levels at baseline, and again 4 weeks later, and answered
questions regarding the acceptability and use of the digital support
resource. Significant decreases were seen in maternal anxiety and in
maternal use of pressure to eat and restriction of food from children
for weight reasons. Mothers reported that the Child Feeding Guide was
easy to use, that they valued its credibility and reassurances, and that
its content helped them to better understand their child's eating
behaviour. These promising findings suggest that naturalistic use of a
digital health intervention could contribute to reductions in mothers'
use of controlling feeding practices and levels of anxiety. Such
findings are important for supporting the development of healthy eating
habits in young children and are likely to be relevant to health and
childcare professionals.},

 abstract = {Current efforts to address and alleviate the suffering and harms
associated with gambling disorder (GD) predominately involve in-person
psychotherapy or static web-based interventions, while dynamic,
proactive approaches to the treatment of GD are needed. Currently,
several medical health (mHealth) apps for GD exist, but none are
empirically validated and, even though they could be potentially useful,
these interventions are static, reactive approaches and they are not
based on the geo-fencing principle. Advances in smartphone technology
now allow for a paradigm shift. Just-in-time adaptive interventions
(JITAI) are technology-based dynamic interventions that proactively
respond to time-varying information to provide intervention at critical
moments. In this paper, a novel JITAI mHealth app for GD called ``Don't
Go There{''} (DGT) is presented. It capitalizes on smartphones' global
positioning software (GPS) or other zero-permission embedded sensors to
recognizes a user's location. When the patient turns off the GPS
capabilities, we infer the geolocation solving a probabilistic route
matching problem. The purpose of DGT is to construct a geofence around a
gambler's favored gambling establishment, to discourage participation.
We hypothesize that the deployment of this app could lead to a reduction
in gambling behavior and problems and improve psychological functioning.},

 abstract = {The successful introduction of new digital tools on the shop floor and
the evaluation of their impacts on workers and their work practices are
challenging tasks. Choosing and applying the right evaluation approach,
methods, and measures to analyze the impact of digital interventions is
a challenging task. To support researchers and practitioners in this
challenge, the authors present a study out of the context of a
large-scale European project, Facts4workers, which developed and
implemented worker-centered smart factory solutions that support
knowledge work on the shop floor level. Interventions through
digitalization have increased workers' job satisfaction, innovation and
problem-solving skills, and productivity of organizations. The study
demonstrates the context-of-use of socio-technical interventions at four
case companies in Germany, Slovenia, and Spain. Combining different
kinds of assessments, including quantitative (surveys) as well as
qualitative data (interviews, observations) - the authors show how the
digital solutions extend the workers' knowledge and competencies and
thereby enhance their problem-solving and innovation skills. The
evaluation results enable us to deduce valid implications on how to
introduce socio-technical interventions and to design ICT solutions that
are supposed to address the productivity and more importantly the
workers' job satisfaction and innovation skills.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in wearable sensor technology and smartphones enable
simple and affordable collection of personal analytics. This paper
reflects on the lessons learned in the SWELL project that addressed the
design of user-centered ICT applications for self-management of vitality
in the domain of knowledge workers. These workers often have a sedentary
lifestyle and are susceptible to mental health effects due to a high
workload. We present the sense-reason-act framework that is the basis of
the SWELL approach and we provide an overview of the individual studies
carried out in SWELL. In this paper, we revisit our work onreasoning:
interpreting raw heterogeneous sensor data, andacting: providing
personalized feedback to support behavioural change. We conclude that
simple affordable sensors can be used to classify user behaviour and
heath status in a physically non-intrusive way. The interpreted data can
be used to inform personalized feedback strategies. Further longitudinal
studies can now be initiated to assess the effectiveness of m-Health
interventions using the SWELL methods.},

 abstract = {Despite the recent increase in research and development of mobile
self-care tools, there are very few solutions regarding the prevention
of negative health effects of menopause. Moreover, most of these
solutions are not based on well-founded user models, such as personas,
and fail to seize the potential of persuasive mobile technology, which
results in a user experience that is neither engaging nor adaptive. In
this paper, we describe how we designed personas during the development
of a mobile application for menopause self-care. For this design, we
used the principles of the Persuasive Systems Design model and the
Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions framework, along with participatory
techniques and demographic data analysis. This approach is not limited
to menopause, as it could be used to reliably represent users in the
interaction design of mobile self-care solutions in other health-related
domains.},

 abstract = {During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, outpatient visits for
patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), were converted into
teleconsultations. As a response to this, a novel mobile health
(mHealth) intervention was developed to support these teleconsultations
with AF patients: TeleCheck-AF. This approach incorporates three
fundamental components: 1) ``Tele{''}: A structured teleconsultation. 2)
``Check{''}: An app-based on-demand heart rate and rhythm monitoring
infrastructure. 3) ``AF{''}: comprehensive AF management.
This report highlights the significant importance of coordination of the
TeleCheck-AF approach at multiple levels and underlines the importance
of streamlining care processes provided by a multidisciplinary team,
using an mHealth intervention, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover,
this report reflects on how the TeleCheck-AF approach has contributed to
strengthening the health system in maintaining management of this
prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, whilst keeping patients out of
hospital, during the pandemic and beyond.},

clinical problem. We integrated different quantitative and qualitative
methodologies from different disciplines to accomplish the task of
adapting an eHealth system for a new set of clinical problems. Building
off of our past development of the VIP website, we used a multi-modal,
iterative user-centered design process to develop the VIP-HANA app. Our
process was used to better understand the needs of a national sample of
PLWH recruited online. Findings from the usability evaluation
demonstrate a potentially useful and easy to use app. Integration of
multi-modal methodologies from different fields to accomplish the tasks

 abstract = {Purpose: An alarming two thirds of adults aged 50 years or over with
hearing impairment who could benefit from hearing aids do not own any,
leaving these adults with no support to self-manage their hearing
problems. In the HEAR-aware project, it is hypothesized that
self-management can be facilitated via a smartphone app if its
educational content is tailored to a person's dynamic stage of readiness
to take action on their hearing (stage of change) and to a person's
dynamic acoustical situations (as measured via a wearable microphone)
and associated challenges (as captured via ecological momentary
assessment). As such, the HEAR-aware app would be an ecological
momentary intervention. This research note describes the rationale and
theoretical underpinnings of the app, as well as therationale for
planning a series of studies to develop and evaluate it.
Study Designs: After a preparatory phase, Study 1 includes qualitative
group interviews to assess user needs. Next, a creative session will be
held, in which all stakeholders involved will work toward a specified
version of the app. Subsequently, prototypes of the app will be
developed and pilot-tested (Pilot Studies 2A and 2B). Users' usage and
ratings (usability and quality indicators) of the app's elements will be
examined and processed in the app. Lastly, the effectiveness of the
app's final version will be examined in a randomized controlled trial
(Study 3).
Discussion: The project's merits and challenges will be discussed.},

@article{WOS:000575062400007,
 abstract = {Background: An increasing number of studies suggest that web-based
interventions for patients with depression can reduce their symptoms and
are expected to fill currently existing treatment gaps. However,
evidence for their efficacy has mainly been derived from comparisons
with wait-list or treatment as usual controls. In particular, designs
using wait-list controls are unlikely to induce hope and may even have
nocebo effects, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the
intervention's efficacy. Studies using active controls are rare and have
not yielded conclusive results.
Objective: The main objective of this study is to assess the acute and
long-term antidepressant efficacy of a 6-week, guided, web-based
self-management intervention building on the principles of cognitive
behavioral therapy (iFightDepression tool) for patients with depression
compared with web-based progressive muscle relaxation as an active
control condition.
Methods: A total of 348 patients with mild-to-moderate depressive
symptoms or dysthymia (according to the Mini International
Neuropsychiatric Interview) were recruited online and randomly assigned
to 1 of the 2 intervention arms. Acute antidepressant effects after 6
weeks and long-term effects at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up were
studied using the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-self-rating as
a primary outcome parameter and change in quality of life (Short Form
12) and user satisfaction (client satisfaction questionnaire) as
secondary outcome parameters. Treatment effects were assessed using
mixed model analyses.
Results: Over the entire observation period, a greater reduction in
symptoms of depression (P=.01) and a greater improvement of life quality
(P<.001) was found in the intervention group compared with the active
control group. Separate tests for each time point revealed significant
effects on depressive symptoms at the 3-month follow-up (d=0.281; 95\%
CI 0.069 to 0.493), but not after 6 weeks (main outcome: d=0.192; 95\%
CI -0.020 to 0.404) and 6 and 12 months The intervention was
significantly superior to the control condition with respect to user
satisfaction (25.31 vs 21.97; t 259 =5.804; P<.01).
Conclusions: The fact that antidepressant effects have been found for a
guided self-management tool in comparison with an active control
strengthens the evidence base for the efficacy of web-based
interventions. The antidepressant effect became most prominent at the
3-month follow-up. After 6 weeks of intervention, significant positive
effects were observed on life quality but not on depressive symptoms.
Although the effect size of such web-based interventions on symptoms of
depression might be smaller than that suggested by earlier studies using
wait-list control conditions, they can be a cost-effective addition to
antidepressants and face-to-face psychotherapy.},

deliver training, assessment, prevention, and treatment of adverse
outcomes after trauma worldwide. In order to encourage research on
E-health applications in the field of traumatic stress, this current
special issue of theEuropean Journal of Psychotraumatologypresents a
series of papers divided into three emergent topics: I) development of
digital interventions, II) the use of digital interventions to foster
self-management and deliver therapy, and III) digital methods to improve
prediction, assessment, and monitoring of post-trauma outcomes. These
studies show acceptance of the tools by various end-user groups and
improvements of current research and clinical practices, but also areas
for improvement regarding the development process and making even better
use of technological capabilities of E-Health. We propose three general
themes to accelerate the quality of e-Health interventions and studies
in this area in the coming years: optimizing user engagement and
adherence, conducting more (innovative) research, and increasing
implementation and dissemination activities. This issue appears in the
midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is exactly at times like these that
we need effective online interventions and we see an enormous increase
in the use of e-Health. We hope this issue will contribute to help those

3-month follow-up. Of participants who completed weekly surveys, 88.9\%
used the program; 22.0\% of participants reported regular, weekly use.
Most tools received good likeability and perceived benefit scores, but
lower perceived benefit scores on three tools suggest that some content
may require additional adaptation. Intent-to-treat analyses using
multilevel modeling with multiple imputation to account for missing data
were conducted. Effect sizes for PTSS were below the cutoff for small
effects at posttest, d = -0.14, but demonstrated a small positive effect
at 3-months, d = -0.25. There was a small positive effect of treatment
on anxiety at posttest, d = -0.37, and a medium effect at 3-month
follow-up, d = -0.49. Treatment effects for depressed mood were below
the cutoff for small effects at posttest and 3-months, ds = -0.14 and
-0.18. These findings suggest that the PTSD Coach Online-Arabic may be a
promising supplemental resource for support in this setting.},

 abstract = {Noise-induced hearing loss is a major public health challenge for
agricultural communities. However, there is limited hearing conservation
research addressing the issue, especially for youth and young adults.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions and
practices of Indiana undergraduate students who lived or worked on a
farm. The students were asked to rank the most common and current
hearing conservation educational approaches, including in-person
classroom presentation, mailers, and technology-based approaches, i.e.,
computer-based training, interactive websites, static websites, and
smartphone noise-measuring applications (apps). A total of 91
undergraduate students enrolled in agriculture classes at four Indiana
higher educational institutions participated in the study. They
completed a sociodemographic and farm activity survey, followed by a
30-minute in-person presentation on hearing health conservation. After
the presentation, each participant completed a questionnaire that
included items about their perceptions of the feasibility,
sustainability, rankings, and preferences of the various educational
approaches discussed in the presentation. Participants ranked the
noise-measuring app and in-person classroom presentation as their most
preferred educational approaches for hearing conservation (39\% and
28\%, respectively). They identified multiple features of these two
intervention approaches as beneficial. Sixty-four percent of
participants indicated that a combination of approaches could influence
hearing protection use and should include in-person classroom
presentation and one of the technology-based approaches (noise-measuring
apps, 37.3\%). These findings are expected to assist health
interventionists and program designers in developing future hearing
protection education programs for farm youth, who may otherwise lack
access to resources for preventing premature hearing loss due to loud
noise exposure.},

 abstract = {AIM: The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of
a mobile health (mHealth) intervention on the wellbeing of Pasifika
peoples, and to explore factors associated with Pasifika wellbeing.
METHODS: The OL@-OR@ mHealth programme was a co-designed smartphone app.
Culturally relevant data was collected to examine holistic health and
wellbeing status, at baseline, and at 12 weeks (end of the trial). The
concept of wellbeing was examined as part of a two-arm, cluster
randomised trial, using only the Pasifika data: 389 (of 726) Pasifika
adults were randomised to receive the mHealth intervention, while 405
(of 725) Pasifika adults were randomised to receive a control version of
the intervention. Culturally relevant data was collected to examine
holistic health and wellbeing status, at baseline, and at 12 weeks (end
of the trial). The intervention effects and the association of
demographic and behavioural relationships with wellbeing, was examined
using logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: Relative to baseline, there were significant differences
between the intervention and control groups for the `family/community'
wellbeing, at the end of the 12-week trial. There were no significant
differences observed for all other wellbeing domains for both groups.
Based on our multivariate regression analyses, education and
acculturation (assimilation and marginalisation) were identified as
positively strong factors associated to Pasifika `family and community'
wellbeing.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights on how Pasifika peoples'
characteristics and behaviours align to wellbeing. Our findings point to
`family and community' as being the most important wellbeing factor for
Pasifika peoples.},

Englishmajor undergraduate students at Universidad Tecnica Particular de
Loja, in southern Ecuador. The participants were 42 students at the A2
level, according to the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for
Languages). All of them were enrolled in an English Language Integrated
Skills course. A mixed-method approach was used to collect and analyze
data in this study. Pre and post-questionnaires, observation sheets, and
speaking rubrics were applied as instruments. Students used their
smartphones to create digital portfolios in a free storage service
(Google Drive), which included videos and audios about certain topics
considered in the course syllabus. The speaking activities consisted of
recording information in different locations of the university campus
(cafeteria, laboratories, library, chapel, sports ground), and other
places of the city. The students worked individually, in pairs or groups
to carry out different speaking activities during an academic term of 5
months. Personalized feedback was provided by analyzing the students'
oral performance through the speech artifacts uploaded in each
portfolio. The fmdings show that digital portfolios were effective to
enhance students' pronunciation and fluency. It was also confirmed that
the implementation of digital portfolios through free storage services
can increase students' motivation to practice oral skills in the target
language.},

 abstract = {The biopsychosocial (BPS) model proposes that health is best understood
as a combination of bio-physiological, psychological and social
determinants, and thus advocates for a far more comprehensive
investigation of the relationships between `mind-body' health. For this
holistic analysis, we need a suitable measure to indicate participants'
`biological' stress. With the advent of wearable sensor devices, health
monitoring is becoming easier. In this study, we focus on
bio-physiological indicators of stress, from wearable devices using the
heart-rate data. The analysis of such heart-rate data presents a set of
practical challenges. We review various measures currently in use for
stress measurement and their relevance and significance with the
wearables' heart-rate data. In this paper, we propose to use the novel
`peak heart-rate count' metric to quantify level of `biological' stress.
Real life biometric data obtained from digital health intervention
program was considered for the study. Our study indicates the
significance of using frequency of `peak heart-rate count' as a
`biological' stress measure.},

 abstract = {The prospective benefit of mHealth can be expected to revolutionize
health service profile worldwide. mHealth consist of short message
service (SMS), web based interventions, smart phone applications and
telehealth. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is now familiar among
women in their reproductive age as a disorder affecting them
irrespective of their age. Young women in India have high prevalence of
PCOS ranging from 9.13 to 36 per cent. PCOS inclines young women at a
greater risk of developing insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome as
well as cardiovascular disease. Hundred young women aged 19-25 years
were selected from ten hostels located in Coimbatore city, Tamil Nadu.
Formulation of the interview schedule was done as a tool to assess the
information of the locale, their health status, lifestyle practice and
physical activity level. The tools used for dietary assessment included
24 hour dietary recall carried out for three consecutive days and a
questionnaire to know their frequency of consuming different foods.
Anthropometric measurement was carried out to compute BMI and waist hip
ratio. A pre-intervention questionnaire to assess the knowledge of young
women on PCOS was also administered. mHealth message was developed on
PCOS containing 110-150 characters including punctuation, bold and
italic letters and mHealth messages were sent for a period of 12 days
via WhatsApp. After 12 days, with the help of post-intervention
questionnaire a change in knowledge on PCOS was appraised. mHealth can
be used as an effective communication tool to provide information and
bring changes in knowledge, attitude and behavior for other areas which
is likely to change the current situation of delivering health service

 abstract = {Smartphones are used to both perpetrate and intervene in dating and
domestic violence (DV). However, existing DV literature primarily
evaluates technology as a tool for perpetration and emerging frameworks
that measure eHealth app interventions have not yet considered DV.
To address this gap, the Dating and Domestic Violence App Rubric
assesses smartphone-based DV intervention apps along common eHealth app
measures such as user responsiveness and security as well as
DV-appropriateness - categories derived from eHealth intervention theory
and evidence-based DV interventions. As proof of concept, 38 DV
intervention apps for iPhone were measured using this rubric.
K-means cluster analysis identified three clusters (high, medium, low).
Apps targeting specific users or a specific intervention strategy tended
to score higher overall. Findings suggest high-quality DV intervention
apps may depend on active collaboration between stakeholders including
app developers, DV advocates, and other professionals. Future research
should expand this research to include additional DV apps and explore
how individuals use smartphone apps to prevent or intervene in DV.},

 abstract = {Over the last years, biofeedback applications are increasingly used to
enhance interoceptive awareness and self-regulation, in psychiatry and
beyond. These applications are used to strengthen emotion regulation
skills by home training (ambulatory biofeedback) and real-time support
in everyday life stressful situations (biocueing). Unfortunately,
knowledge about the feasibility and effectivity of these applications is
still scarce. Therefore, a systematic literature search was performed.
In total, 30 studies (4 biocueing, 26 ambulatory biofeedback) were
reviewed; 21 of these studies were conducted in non-psychiatric samples
and 9 studies in psychiatric samples. Study characteristics, biofeedback
characteristics, effectivity and feasibility outcomes were extracted.
Despite the rapid advances in wearable technology, only a few biocueing
studies were found. In the majority of the studies significant positive
effects were found on self-reported (stress-related) psychological
measures. Significant improvements on physiological measures were also
reported, though these measures were used less frequently. Feasibility
of the applications was often reported as sufficient, though not
adequately assessed in most studies. Taken into account the small sample
sizes and the limited quality of the majority of the studies in this
recently emerging field, biocueing and ambulatory biofeedback
interventions showed promising results. Future research is expected to
be focusing on biocueing as a just-in-time adaptive intervention. To
establish this research field, closer cooperation between research
groups, use of more rigorous as well as individually tailored research
designs and more valid feasibility and effectivity assessment are
recommended.},

 abstract = {Background. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the largest care gap for common
mental disorders (CMDs) globally, heralding the use of cost-cutting
approaches such as task-shifting and digital technologies as viable
approaches for expanding the mental health workforce. This study aims to
evaluate the effectiveness of a problem-solving therapy (PST)
intervention that is delivered by community health volunteers (CHVs)
through a mobile application called `Inuka coaching' in Kenya.
Methods. A pilot prospective cohort study recruited participants from 18
health centres in Kenya. People who self-screened were eligible if they
scored 8 or higher on the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20), were
aged 18 years or older, conversant in written and spoken English, and
familiar with the use of smart mobile devices. The intervention
consisted of four PST mobile application chat-sessions delivered by
CHVs. CMD measures were administered at baseline, 4-weeks
(post-treatment), and at 3-months follow-up assessment.
Results. In all, 80 participants consented to the study, of which 60
participants (female, n = 38; male, n = 22) completed their 4-week
assessments, and 52 participants completed their 3-month follow-up
assessment. The results showed a significant improvement over time on
the Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20). Higher-range income, not
reporting suicidal ideation, being aged over 30 years, and being male
were associated with higher CMD symptom reduction.
Conclusion. To our knowledge, this report is the first to pilot a PST
intervention that is delivered by CHVs through a locally developed
mobile application in Kenya, to which clinically meaningful improvements
were found. However, a randomised-controlled trial is required to
robustly evaluate this intervention.},

 abstract = {Advances in sensor technology and machine learning as well as the
widespread use of smartphones are shifting the focus of healthcare.
Emerging paradigms such as cyber-physical systems (CPSs) make possible
the transition from reactive to preventive care. CPSs can be implemented
to achieve effective mobile health solutions and to provide
sophisticated new mechanisms to monitor an individual's state in
real-time via the use of sensors and mobile devices. Despite the
significant potential impact of such systems, their implementation poses
a range of complex technical challenges. This article surveys the
state-of-the-art in implementations of CPSs for real-time personalized
interventions. A general three layer architecture which can be used to
consider current implementations is first presented along with a
description of its main components. We also propose a three level
taxonomy in accordance with the system capabilities. Then, the principal
technical challenges, human-machine interaction challenges and future
directions are discussed. Fifteen of the state-of-the-art
implementations are qualitatively evaluated in terms of sensor
capabilities, just-in-time reaction, interruptibility, and adherence,
among other characteristics. By reviewing the state-of-the-art of the
systems that have been built to-date, the focus of the review is to
summarize current technical challenges and future opportunities for both
future CPS implementers and behavioral scientists designing CPS for
personalized interventions.},

 abstract = {Mobile health applications are in demand. According to the Grand Review
Research group, there were US \$12.4 billion in mobile health app sales
in 2018. Increasingly, providers are seeking new ways to engage their
pediatric patients. One approach is through mobile health apps. Nearly
10 000 mobile health apps target youth and teens, especially for
children with conditions that require complex treatment and
self-management. One such chronic illness is asthma. Children with
asthma who lack social support are particularly vulnerable to
exacerbations because they often are not focused on self-care. For this
reason, successful asthma programs for children engage family members,
encouraging them to play an active role on the healthcare team. The
Just-in-Time Asthma Self-management Intervention is unique in several
ways compared to other asthma management mobile applications. The app
uses gold standard, evidence-based asthma care practices and extends the
support infrastructure beyond family and healthcare providers to engage
the child, their peers, and school personnel. Further, the app was built
using a systems engineering approach. This article reviews the basis for
developing an asthma care mobile application including the conceptual
framework supporting a systems model, how the Just-in-Time Asthma
Self-management Intervention is unique, and how it was built using a

 abstract = {While determining the water balance for large irrigation schemes, coping
with complexities and uncertainties in estimation of groundwater (GW)
abstraction is still a challenge. On other hand, estimating GW
abstraction is of paramount importance to ensure the proper management
of surface and GW resources. Although, there are number of well-known
methods exist to map GW abstraction, utilization-factor (U-f) is
considered as a reliable method. However, at large scales, tubewells
utilization time required for U-f method is difficult to retrieve as
large and small tubewells are governed under different rules.
Geo-informatics is another emerging approach being used to estimate GW
abstraction, however, there are several complexities and uncertainties
involved in characterizing GW abstraction using satellite remote sensing
imagery that leads to inaccurate end results. In current study, in-situ
GW measurements were performed to calibrate and validate the GW
abstraction estimated from geo-informatics approach at Lower Bari Doab
Canal (LBDC) command area of the Indus basin of Pakistan. For insitu
measurements, an intensive tubewell survey was conducted at a grid size
of 1 km at 30 locations situated at head, middle and tail end reaches of
the LBDC. For the geo-informatics approach used in this study, GW
abstraction is considered as a difference of actual evapotranspiration
(ETa) from net canal water use and effective rainfall after satisfying
soil moisture storage changes. Results of calibration of geo-informatics
approach compared with the in-situ measurements showed R-2 of 0.89, 0.81
and 0.79 at head, middle and tail end reaches, respectively. Intra-grid
annual comparison of in-situ measurements showed that tubewells were
being governed by different rules and thus yielded different abstraction
within a grid ranging from 854 mm (+/- 105) at head, 742 mm (+/- 220) at
middle and 649 mm (+/- 244) at tail grids. Statistical analysis showed
that annual GW abstraction by in-situ measurements at head 814 mm (+/-
52), middle 769 mm (+/- 44) and tail 688 mm (+/- 56) end reaches varied
significantly at a confidence interval of 95\%. The spatial mapping by
geo-informatics showed that farmers' fields situated at proximity of
head end reaches utilize 4\% and 9\% extra water than from those placed
at middle and tail end reaches, respectively. The inequity of GW
abstraction in LBDC command area highlighted in this study requires
immediate intervention of policy makers for sustainable GW management.},

 abstract = {Background: E-mental health interventions may help to bridge the mental
health treatment gap. Evidence on their effectiveness is compelling in
high-income countries. Not enough evidence has been generated on their
use with communities affected by adversity in low- and middle-income
countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), the National Mental
Health Programme (NMMP) at Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) in Lebanon
and other partners have adapted a WHO intervention called Step-by-Step
for use with Lebanese and displaced people living in Lebanon.
Step-by-Step is a minimally guided, internet-based intervention for
adults with depression. In this study, a feasibility randomised
controlled trial (RCT) and a qualitative process evaluation were
conducted to explore the feasibility and the acceptability of the
research methods, and the intervention, in preparation for two fully
powered trials to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
Step-by-Step in Lebanon. Method: Participants were recruited through
social media. Inclusion criteria were: being able to understand and
speak Arabic or English; access to an internet connected device; aged
over 18; living in Lebanon; scores above cut-off on the Patient Health
Questionnaire and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0.
Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or enhanced care
as usual. They completed post-assessments eight weeks after baseline,
and follow-up assessments another three months later. Primary outcomes
were depression and level of functioning, secondary outcomes were
anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and well-being. Qualitative interviews
were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the
research procedures and the intervention. Results: A total of N = 138
participants, including 33 Syrians, were recruited and randomised into
two equal groups. The dropout rate was higher in the control group (73\%
post- and 82\% follow-up assessment) than in the intervention group
(63\% post- and 72\% follow-up assessment). The intervention was
perceived as relevant, acceptable and beneficial to those who completed
it. Suggestions were made to further adapt the content and to make the
intervention more engaging. Statistical analyses were conducted despite
the small sample size. Complete cases analysis showed a statistically
significant symptom reduction in depression, anxiety, disability, and
post-traumatic stress, and statistically significant improvement in
well-being and functioning. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed
non-significant effects. Conclusion: The research design, methods and
procedures are feasible and acceptable in the context of Lebanon and can
be applied in the RCTs. Preliminary findings suggest that Step-by-Step
may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety and
improving functioning and well-being.},

 abstract = {IMPORTANCE Cardiorespiratory fitness is an important marker of childhood
health and low fitness levels are a risk factor for disease later in
life. Levels of children's fitness have declined in recent decades.
Whether school-based physical activity interventions can increase
fitness at the population level remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of an internet-based intervention on
children's cardiorespiratory fitness across a large number of schools.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cluster randomized clinical
trial, 22 government-funded elementary schools (from 137 providing
consent) including 1188 students stratified from grades 3 and 4 in New
South Wales, Australia, were randomized. The other schools received the
intervention but were not included in the analysis. Eleven schools
received the internet-based intervention and 11 received the control
intervention. Recruitment and baseline testing began in 2016 and ended
in 2017. Research assistants, blinded to treatment allocation, completed
follow-up outcome assessments at 12 and 24 months. Data were analyzed
from July to August 2020.
INTERVENTIONS The internet-based intervention included standardized
online learning for teachers and minimal in-person support from a
project mentor (9-10 months).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for
cardiorespiratory fitness.
RESULTS Of 1219 participants (49\% girls; mean {[}SD] age, 8.85 {[}0.71]
years) from 22 schools, 1188 students provided baseline primary outcome
data. At 12 months, the number of 20-m shuttle runs increased by 3.32
laps (95\% CI, 2.44-4.20 laps) in the intervention schools and 2.11 laps
(95\% CI, 1.38-2.85 laps) in the control schools (adjusted difference =
1.20 laps; 95\% CI, 0.17-2.24 laps). By 24 months, the adjusted
difference was 2.22 laps (95\% CI, 0.89-3.55 laps). The cost per student
was AUD33 (USD26).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, a school-based intervention
improved children's cardiorespiratory fitness when delivered in a large
number of schools. The low cost and sustained effect over 24 months of
the intervention suggests that it may have potential to be scaled at the
population level.},

 abstract = {Psychological interventions for addictive behaviours (i.e., alcohol,
smoking, gambling) typically focus on reducing the frequency of that
target behaviour. Individuals generally set a ``count goal{''} and then
monitor the frequency of these behaviours via a process of
counting/recording (i.e., number of alcoholic drinks, number of dollars
gambled). We argue that this approach, although a key feature of
interventions, presents a range of challenges, including: confusion
regarding what constitutes a count; remembering to keep count; and
remembering to stop at a certain count. We argue that these inherent
features of ``count goals{''} may serve to undermine treatment
effectiveness for addictive behaviours and potentially other behaviour
change interventions. Furthermore, given counting of specific behaviours
occurs frequently within digital interventions (e.g., steps, cigarettes,
drinks), these issues may be further exacerbated within mHealth
(interventions delivered through mobile digital devices). In this
article, we offer an alternative to setting ``count goals{''} as part of
a behavioural intervention. This approach directly limits a problem
behaviour by constraining the time period, and rate of that behaviour,
with no requirement to count or record the frequency of the behaviour-we
refer to this as the ``Chronos Approach.{''} We suggest that this
approach lends itself particularly well to mHealth interventions,
whereby daily reminders and timed alerts can be easily programmed into a
smartphone. We discuss the advantages of this method and illustrate how
it can be effectively incorporated into mHealth behaviour interventions,
providing a specific example of an alcohol reduction smartphone app
wherein the Chronos Approach has been implemented.},

 abstract = {Good oral hygiene is essential to oral health and oral disease
prevention. Strengthening the adherence of patients with periodontitis
to oral hygiene behaviors (OHBs) is crucial for the success of
periodontal treatment. This study aims to investigate the intervention
effectiveness of a novel mobile app for precision oral self-care, which
was developed to help patients with periodontitis improving their oral
hygiene through daily oral self-care. One-hundred and fifty eligible
patients were recruited into this study and randomly allocated to the
control (n = 75) or intervention group (n = 75), and their oral hygiene
status (OHS) and OHBs were recorded at baseline and re-evaluation. The
participants in the intervention group were required to perform daily
oral self-care using our oral self-care app (OSCA) and the functional
preferences and overall likeability of the OSCA were evaluated through a
questionnaire survey. In total, 39 patients from the control group and
49 from the intervention group completed clinical examinations at
baseline and re-evaluation. The results demonstrated that there was no
significant difference in OHS improvement between the two groups.
However, OHS improvement significantly differed between low-, moderate-,
and high-frequency users, with frequency of use being positively
correlated to the likeability of the app. Further investigation of the
effectiveness of the OSCA intervention revealed that behavioral change
in oral hygiene, frequency of OSCA use, and smoking affected OHS
improvement. These outcomes indicate that our app-based mobile
intervention may be of value for precision oral self-care in patients
with periodontitis.},

acceptance of the app. Several youths described changing risk behaviors
after enrolling in the study. Youth found the app easy to navigate and
the goal interface helpful in tracking progress. Challenges included
stolen phones and survey timing. Youth experiencing homelessness
strongly recommended customized messages and questions to avoid
redundancy, and that real-time support for struggling youth be
accessible through the app. Conclusion. A just-in-time adaptive
intervention for HIV prevention is acceptable to YEH. Larger studies are
needed to evaluate long- term impacts on HIV risk behavior.},

 abstract = {Depression is a global health problem; as an illness it may affect any
person, independently from age, job or social condition. University
students are immersed in environments of high levels of stress and
responsibility, which may cause depressive symptoms. This is the context
from which the relevance of the work described in this paper derives: a
pilot study that was developed during the first stages of a research
project aimed at assessing the efficacy of a digital audiovisual
psychoeducational intervention (called DEEP) on depressive symptoms and
depressive disorders in Portuguese university students. The pilot study
was developed with a group of 12 Portuguese university students and
included a survey by questionnaire applied to assess literacy in
depression in pre- and post-intervention stages. The audiovisual content
was shared on a private group on an instant messaging application for
smartphones. Pre- and post-intervention results show that participants'
ability to recognize depressive symptoms, identify causes and adequate
treatment options for depression was higher after watching the
audiovisual content of DEEP intervention. Our work has led us to
conclude that, when combined with digital resources, psychoeducational
interventions arouse more interest in participants and motivation to new
knowledge enhancing mental health literacy. (C) 2021 The Authors.

 abstract = {Aims
Childhood trauma is associated with an elevated risk for psychosis, but
the psychological mechanisms involved remain largely unclear. This study
aimed to investigate emotional and psychotic stress reactivity in daily
life as a putative mechanism linking childhood trauma and clinical
outcomes in individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis.
Methods
Experience sampling methodology was used to measure momentary stress,
affect and psychotic experiences in the daily life of N = 79 UHR
individuals in the EU-GEI High Risk Study. The Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported childhood trauma.
Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up.
Results
The association of stress with positive (beta = -0.14, p = 0.010) and
negative affect (beta = 0.11, p = 0.020) was modified by transition
status such that stress reactivity was greater in individuals who
transitioned to psychosis. Moreover, the association of stress with
negative affect (beta = 0.06, p = 0.019) and psychotic experiences (beta
= 0.05, p = 0.037) was greater in individuals exposed to high v. low
levels of childhood trauma. We also found evidence that decreased
positive affect in response to stress was associated with reduced
functioning at 1-year follow-up (B = 6.29, p = 0.034). In addition,
there was evidence that the association of childhood trauma with poor
functional outcomes was mediated by stress reactivity (e.g. indirect
effect: B = -2.13, p = 0.026), but no evidence that stress reactivity
mediated the association between childhood trauma and transition (e.g.
indirect effect: B = 0.14, p = 0.506).
Conclusions
Emotional and psychotic stress reactivity may be potential mechanisms
linking childhood trauma with clinical outcomes in UHR individuals.},

 abstract = {Utilizing social media platforms to recruit participants for digital
health interventions is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability
to directly track advertising spend, number of app downloads and other
metrics transparently. The following paper concerns the initial tests
completed on the Facebook Ad Manager platform for the chatbot-delivered
digital health intervention Elena+ Care for COVID-19. Eleven
advertisements were run in the UK and Ireland during August/September
2020, with resulting downloads, post (i.e. advert) reactions, post
shares and other advertisement engagement metrics tracked. Key findings
from our advertising campaigns highlight that: (i) static images with
text function better than carousel of images, (ii) Android users
download and exhibit greater engagement behaviors than iOS users, and
(iii) middle-aged and older women have the highest number of downloads
and the most engaged behaviors (i.e. reacting to posts, sharing posts
etc.). Lessons learned are discussed considering how other designers of
digital health interventions may benefit and learn from our results when
trialing and running their own ad campaigns. It is hoped that such
discussions will be beneficial to other health practitioners seeking to
scale-up their digital health interventions widely and reach individuals
in need.},

 abstract = {Purpose of ReviewMany psychosocial interventions for substance use
disorders (SUDs) focus on teaching self-regulation strategies. Research
using intensive longitudinal methods (ILM), such as ecological momentary
assessment and daily diaries, is critical for elucidating if and how
these strategies function as mechanisms of change among individuals with
SUDs. We review this emerging area of research.Recent FindingsWe found a
small number of studies using ILM to study self-regulation strategies in
SUD (n=18 studies), with most conducted among college student drinkers
(n=9) and cigarette smokers (n=7), and few among treatment-engaged
individuals, and those with other drug use disorders. There is
preliminary evidence that the use of specific self-regulation strategies
commonly taught in psychosocial interventions for SUDs (i.e., cognitive
reappraisal, problem-solving, stimulus control, harm reduction) is
associated with decreased momentary or daily substance use, at the
within-person level.SummaryThere is a need for further ILM research on
self-regulation strategies as mechanisms of substance use behavior
change. Such research can inform the development, refinement, and
personalization of interventions that teach self-regulation strategies,
including mobile interventions that facilitate strategy use in the
moment. One key next step is developing psychometrically validated ILM
assessments of self-regulation strategy use.},

 abstract = {Objectives Machine learning models are a promising, yet underutilized
tool within the mindfulness field. Accordingly, this work aimed to
provide a practical introduction to key machine learning concepts
through an illustrative investigation of the association between at-home
mindfulness exercise compliance and stress reduction. To further
interrogate the currently inconclusive nature of the compliance-outcome
association within the mindfulness literature, the illustrative example
leveraged a suite of machine learning techniques to highlight the unique
affordances and perspectives of the predictive framework. Methods
Foundational information regarding facets of the machine learning
analytical process, including model types, data preprocessing, feature
engineering, validation, performance evaluation, and model
introspection, was presented. With emphasis on providing details and
justifications regarding modeling decisions along the way, the work
systematically applied these introduced concepts to a real-world data
example. This permitted an opportunity to build, introspect, and derive
insight from a model tasked to explore dynamics underlying patient
compliance to mindfulness exercises within a web-based delivery setting.
Results The constructed machine learning models suggested a moderate
correlation of compliance with post-intervention reliable change in
stress (r = 0.349 +/- 0.018). Model introspection tools further revealed
that a combination of both high consistency and high overall average
compliance predicts a trend toward greater reduction in self-reported
stress. Conclusions Results of the illustrative study suggested that
compliance, in pattern and absolute magnitude, is a significant
contributor to online mindfulness therapy outcomes. Moreover, modeling
efforts implicate machine learning as a uniquely beneficial paradigm
with which to explore nuanced questions in the mindfulness research
space.},

 abstract = {Background: To identify critical periods for just-in-time adaptive
interventions (JITAIs), we measured time-varying correlates of drinking
(e.g. stress, mood) daily to predict near-term alcohol use. Methods:
Emerging adults (aged 17-24; n = 51) who reported past-month alcohol use
used SARA, an app use designed to assess substance use, for 30 days.
Participants completed daily process measures of stress, mood,
hopefulness, free time, fun, and loneliness. Candidate variables for
prediction of next-day drinking included a contextual factor (day of the
week), between-person factors (age, sex), and within-person factors
(daily process measure responses) as well as daily process measure
noncompletion. We compared two approaches to predict next-day use. From
the daily process measure responses, Approach 1 used the current day's
survey responses; whereas, Approach 2 used the deviation of daily
responses from the participant's average response in prior days.
Backward model selection identified candidate variables to include in
the logistic model. Each model's discriminatory power was determined
using the area under the curve (AUC). Toward identifying critical
periods for interventions, decision rules for when next day alcohol use
was likely are reported for the better performing approach. Results:
Approach 1 included day of the week, hopefulness, stress, and
participant sex (AUC = 0.76). Approach 2 included day of the week, and
deviation in hopefulness rating (AUC = 0.71). Decisional cutpoints are
provided for the better performing model. Conclusions: Approach 1
provided better prediction than Approach 2. Decisional tools for
identification of near-term alcohol use in emerging adults open the door
for JITAIs to reduce drinking and prevent consequences of use.},

phase three included a two-year work process including focus group
interviews and think aloud interviews with users. Through the steps of
literature review, theoretical framework, and an iterative development
process with users and other stakeholders, a six-week program was
developed. The program included psychoeducational information,
multimedia, exercises, and weekly telephone follow-up with a dedicated
nurse. This Internet-delivered intervention can be a novel method for
addressing the gap in the provision of follow-up for women after

 abstract = {Purpose Digital extension is widely embraced in African agricultural
development, promising unprecedented outcomes and impact. Especially
phone-based services attract attention as tools for effective and
efficient agricultural extension. To date, assessments of digital
extension services are generally ex-post in nature, thus consideration
of users and broader systems occurs once an intervention is broadly
identified. However, early understanding of user needs, readiness, and
relevant context is a prerequisite for successful adoption and
sustainable use of digital extension services. We conducted an ex-ante
assessment of user readiness (UR) for phone-based services.
Design/Methodology/Approach We developed an ex-ante framework to assess
UR, considering capabilities, opportunities, and motivations of targeted
users. The case study of Rwandan banana farmers served to verify the UR
framework, using survey data from 690 smallholder farmers. Findings
Findings demonstrate limited capacity to access and use phone-based
extension services, especially those requiring a smartphone, and a
mismatch between expected UR and actual UR, current capabilities and
opportunities. Findings provide entry points for designing suitable
digital extension projects and interventions, suggesting a need for
capacity building. Practical implications The UR-framework provided
understanding about current limitations in farmer readiness for digital
extension. This ex-ante approach to explore UR before designing digital
interventions for African farmers is recommended. It points at the
importance of embedding digital technologies into existing practices and
creating blends of `digital' and `analogue' or `high-tech' and
`low-tech'. Theoretical implications The UR-framework provides a
structured approach to developing pre-intervention insights about users
and use-context, supporting informed strategizing and decision-making
about digital extension. It is a relevant addition to existing readiness
frameworks, participatory design methods, and ex-post intervention
performance assessments, as part of a balanced readiness level
assessment. Originality/Value This is the first ex-ante assessment of UR
for digital extension services in an African context, and the first
attempt to analyse Rwandan farmers' readiness for digital extension
services.},

 abstract = {Rumination is a transdiagnostic risk factor that appears to be reduced
through mindfulness interventions. However, mindfulness mobile apps have
not been tested for their effects on rumination, especially among
adolescents. Thus, we aimed to test the acceptability and effects of a
mindfulness mobile intervention among ruminative adolescents using a
within-subjects pretest/posttest design. Participants were 80
adolescents ages 12-15, selected for moderate-to-high rumination (M age
= 14.01, SD = .99; 46.2\% girls; 86.25\% White; 3.75\% Hispanic). We
asked adolescents to use our mindfulness app 3 times per day for 3
weeks. Participants and parents completed questionnaires at baseline,
post-intervention, and 6 and 12 weeks later. Acceptability was assessed
by tracking app use and asking adolescents and parents to report on
their experiences post-intervention. We assessed repetitive negative
thinking (i.e., rumination and worry) and internalizing symptoms via
self- and parent-report. The intervention demonstrated acceptability,
and there were significant reductions in rumination, worry, anxiety and
parent-reported internalizing symptoms post-intervention. Effects on
rumination, anxiety and internalizing symptoms persisted throughout the
12-week follow-up with large effect sizes using an intention-to-treat
approach. Thus, a brief mindfulness mobile app intervention appeared to
be both engaging and helpful in reducing negative repetitive thinking
and internalizing symptoms among ruminative adolescents. It will be
important to test this intervention in a randomized controlled trial to
control for effects of time and attention.},

 abstract = {Background: Healthy behaviors are crucial for maintaining a person's
health and well-being. The effects of health behavior interventions are
mediated by individual and contextual factors that vary over time.
Recently emerging smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions
(EMIs) can use real-time user reports (ecological momentary assessments
{[}EMAs]) to trigger appropriate support when needed in daily life.
Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the characteristics of
smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs in relation to their
effects on health behaviors, user engagement, and user perspectives.
Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL in June 2019
and updated the search in March 2020. We included experimental studies
that incorporated EMIs based on EMAs delivered through smartphone apps
to promote health behaviors in any health domain. Studies were
independently screened. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. We
performed a narrative synthesis of intervention effects, user
perspectives and engagement, and intervention design and
characteristics. Quality appraisal was conducted for all included
studies. Results: We included 19 papers describing 17 unique studies and
comprising 652 participants. Most studies were quasi-experimental
(13/17, 76\%), had small sample sizes, and great heterogeneity in
intervention designs and measurements. EMIs were most popular in the
mental health domain (8/17, 47\%), followed by substance abuse (3/17,
18\%), diet, weight loss, physical activity (4/17, 24\%), and smoking
(2/17, 12\%). Of the 17 studies, the 4 (24\%) included randomized
controlled trials reported nonstatistically significant effects on
health behaviors, and 4 (24\%) quasi-experimental studies reported
statistically significant pre-post improvements in self-reported primary
outcomes, namely depressive (P<.001) and psychotic symptoms (P=.03),
drinking frequency (P<.001), and eating patterns (P=.01). EMA was
commonly used to capture subjective experiences as well as behaviors,
whereas sensors were rarely used. Generally, users perceived EMIs to be
helpful. Common suggestions for improvement included enhancing
personalization, multimedia and interactive capabilities (eg, voice
recording), and lowering the EMA reporting burden. EMI and EMA
components were rarely reported and were not described in a standardized
manner across studies, hampering progress in this field. A reporting
checklist was developed to facilitate the interpretation and comparison
of findings and enhance the transparency and replicability of future
studies using EMAs and EMIs. Conclusions: The use of
smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs to promote behavior
change is an emerging area of research, with few studies evaluating
efficacy. Such interventions could present an opportunity to enhance
health but need further assessment in larger participant cohorts and
well-designed evaluations following reporting checklists. Future
research should explore combining self-reported EMAs of subjective
experiences with objective data passively collected via sensors to
promote personalization while minimizing user burden, as well as explore
different EMA data collection methods (eg, chatbots). Trial

 abstract = {Background: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental illness characterized by
recurrent episodes of depressed, elevated, and mixed mood states. The
addition of psychotherapy to pharmacological management can decrease
symptoms, lower relapse rates, and improve quality of life; however,
access to psychotherapy is limited. Mental health technologies such as
smartphone apps are being studied as a means to increase access to and
enhance the effectiveness of adjunctive psychotherapies for bipolar
disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder find this intervention
format acceptable, but our understanding of how people utilize and
integrate these tools into their behavior change and maintenance
processes remains limited.
Objective: The objective of this study was to explore how individuals
with bipolar disorder perceive and utilize a smartphone intervention for
health behavior change and maintenance.
Methods: Individuals with bipolar disorder were recruited via flyers
placed at university-affiliated and private outpatient mental health
practices to participate in a pilot study of LiveWell, a
smartphone-based self-management intervention. At the end of the study,
all participants completed in-depth qualitative exit interviews. The
behavior change framework developed to organize the intervention design
was used to deductively code behavioral targets and determinants
involved in target engagement. Inductive coding was used to identify
themes not captured by this framework.
Results: In terms of behavioral targets, participants emphasized the
importance of managing mood episode-related signs and symptoms. They
also discussed the importance of maintaining regular routines, sleep
duration, and medication adherence. Participants emphasized that
receiving support from a coach as well as seeking and receiving
assistance from family, friends, and providers were important for
managing behavioral targets and staying well. In terms of determinants,
participants stressed the important role of monitoring for their
behavior change and maintenance efforts. Monitoring facilitated
self-awareness and reflection, which was considered valuable for staying
well. Some participants also felt that the intervention facilitated
learning information necessary for managing bipolar disorder but others
felt that the information provided was too basic.
Conclusions: In addition to addressing acceptability, satisfaction, and
engagement, a person-based design of mental health technologies can be
used to understand how people experience the impact of these
technologies on their behavior change and maintenance efforts. This
understanding may then be used to guide ongoing intervention
development. The participants' perceptions aligned with the
intervention's primary behavioral targets and use of a monitoring tool
as a core intervention feature. Participant feedback further indicates
that developing additional content and tools to address building and
engaging social support may be an important avenue for improving
LiveWell. A comprehensive behavior change framework to understand
participant perceptions of their behavior change and maintenance efforts
may help facilitate ongoing intervention development.},

 abstract = {Background: Literature shows adolescence is a critical time for forming
health habits and eHealth can be an effective platform for encouraging
health habits.
Purpose: This study seeks to understand the impact of eHealth
intervention that encourages tracking multiple health behaviors on habit
participation and self-rated health.
Methods: Using a web-based portal, we provided incentives to a small
group of high-achieving adolescents (n = 85). The group was encouraged
to log health behaviors grounded in four pillars of health: physical
activity, nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Surveys were
distributed four times to track behaviors and self-rated health.
Results: Surveys showed significant increases in nutrition, sleep,
mindfulness, and self-rated health. Self-rated health consistently
increased independent of the other behaviors.
Discussion: Results suggest interventions such as the one described
herein can engage adolescents to participate in recommended health
behaviors. Further, comprehensive, positive interventions can influence
adolescents' concept of self-rated health despite small increases in
health behaviors. This research further demonstrates eHealth tools can
be an effective way to engage adolescents in preventive health
behaviors.
Translation to Health Education Practice: This study guides future
research by designing a multibehavior health framework for adolescents
and using eHealth as a platform for delivery.},

 abstract = {People who are more physically active tend to have more favorable
automatic evaluations of exercise (i.e., nonconscious evaluations based
on mental associations between ``exercise{''} and ``pleasant{''} or
``unpleasant{''} that manifest into approach tendencies). Although some
interventions have been shown to modify automatic evaluations in
lab-based settings, the training regimes may not translate into scalable
real-world interventions. The aim of these studies were to (a) test how
often people tend to engage with the app in a ``real-world{''} setting,
and (b) test whether an app with gamification features and evaluative
conditioning strategies change automatic evaluations of exercise versus
sedentary behavior. Participants (N = 289, 238 female, M age = 33) were
randomly allocated to have access to either Flex Exercise-a game-based
app which contained 70\% exercise-related content or Flex Control-the
same game-based app with no exercise content. Participants completed an
Implicit Association Test (IAT) as assessments of automatic evaluations
immediately after exposure to Flex and 24 hr later. No significant
between-group difference was observed immediately after exposure to Flex
for automatic evaluations; however, 1 day following exposure, those in
the Flex Exercise condition had significantly more favorable automatic
evaluations of exercise than those in the Flex Control condition (d =
0.24). This effect was driven by a change in automatic evaluations, as
assessed through the IAT, in the control condition more favorable toward
sedentary behavior relative to physical activity and was magnified by
user engagement. This mHealth intervention may have inadvertently
enhanced sedentary automatic evaluations.},

 abstract = {Objective: Prior work has linked exposure to multiple types of trauma
(i.e., polyictimization) to increased risk of negative behavioral health
outcomes compared with exposure to any single event. However, few
studies have attempted to understand how polyvictimization theory
relates specifically to veterans' experiences and behavioral health
outcomes. The present study assessed heterogeneity in reports of
childhood trauma, combat trauma, and military sexual trauma. Method: We
recruited 1,230 veterans outside of traditional Veterans Health
Administration settings to participate in a study assessing behavioral
health. On average, participants were 34.5 years old with the majority
identifying as White (79.3\%) and male (88.7\%). We used latent class
analysis to extract classes of traumatic experience exposure including
childhood trauma, combat trauma, and military sexual trauma. Results:
Five classes emerged: (a) high all; (b) moderate combat trauma, high
military sexual trauma; (c) high combat trauma, moderate military sexual
harassment; (d) moderate childhood trauma and combat trauma; and (e)
combat trauma only. Overall, veterans in profiles that endorsed multiple
trauma types (i.e., polyvictimization) evidenced greater symptoms of
depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and hazardous alcohol or
cannabis use. Further, women were overly represented in profiles that
included multiple victimization typologies, especially when profiles
included elevated endorsement of military sexual trauma. Conclusion: A
polyvictimization framework was partially supported, with differential
effects on behavioral health outcomes noted across trauma experiences.
Public Health Significance Statement This study provides continued
support for a polyvictimization framework among a veteran population
spanning multiple areas of trauma-related factors. Veterans entering
care with multiple traumas may require additional services, particularly
women reporting military sexual trauma.},

 abstract = {mHealth interventions can promote healthy movement behaviors (physical
activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep). However, recent reviews
include few studies from Asia, despite it being home to over 60\% of the
world population. The aim is to map the current evidence for mHealth
interventions targeting movement behaviors in Asia. Six databases were
searched up until August 2021. Included studies described an mHealth
intervention targeting one or more movement behaviors, delivered in a
country/territory in Asia, to a general population. A total of 3986
unique records were screened for eligibility in duplicate. Eighty
studies with 1,413,652 participants were included. Most were randomized
(38.8\%) or quasi-experimental (27.5\%) trials. Studies were from 17
countries/territories (out of 55); majority were high- (65.0\%) or upper
middle-income (28.7\%). Physical activity was targeted most often
(93.8\%), few targeted sedentary behavior (7.5\%), or sleep (8.8\%).
Most targeted one movement behavior (90.0\%), and none targeted all
three together. Interventions typically incorporated a single mHealth
component (70.0\%; app, pedometer, text messages, wearable) and were
delivered remotely (66.3\%). The average intervention length was 121.8
(SD 127.6) days. mHealth interventions in Asia have primarily targeted
physical activity in high- and upper middle-income countries. There are
few interventions targeting sedentary behavior or sleep, and no
interventions in low-income countries.},

 abstract = {Recent times have seen a call for personalized psychotherapy and
tailored communication during treatment, leading to the necessity to
model the complex dynamics of mental disorders in a single subject. To
this aim, time-series data in one patient can be collected through
ecological momentary assessment and analyzed with the graphical vector
autoregressive model, estimating temporal and contemporaneous
idiographic networks. Idiographic networks graph interindividual
processes that may be potentially used to tailor psychotherapy and
provide personalized feedback to clients and are regarded as a promising
tool for clinical practice. However, the question whether we can
reliably estimate them in clinical settings remains unanswered. We
conducted a large-scale simulation study in the context of
psychopathology, testing the performance of personalized networks with
different numbers of time points, percentages of missing data, and
estimation methods. Results indicate that sensitivity is low with sample
sizes feasible for clinical practice (75 and 100 time points). It seems
possible to retrieve the global network structure but not to recover the
full network. Estimating temporal networks appears particularly
challenging; thus, with 75 and 100 observations, it is advisable to
reduce the number of nodes to around six variables. With regard to
missing data, full information maximum likelihood and the Kalman filter
are effective in addressing random item-level missing data;
consequently, planned missingness is a valid method to deal with missing
data. We discuss possible methodological and clinical solutions to the
challenges raised in this work.
Translational Abstract Repeated measures of a subject-using smartphone
apps-combined with sophisticated network-based modeling techniques have
been proposed as promising methods in both psychological research as
well as clinical practice. The promise is that a personalized network
model can be obtained per person, giving unique insights in the dynamics
of that person's life and psychological mechanisms. However, it is not
currently known if such methods are at all tractable with data that can
realistically be obtained. This may be especially problematic in
clinical practice as, in that setting, data is likely scarce and
contains many missing responses. We investigated the feasibility of
these methods using large-scale simulation studies and found that while
missing data can adequately be handled, more data may be required than
previously assumed to reliably estimate personalized networks. We end
the article with concrete suggestions to clinical practitioners as well
as researchers aiming to study personalized network models.},

 abstract = {Introduction: The impact of COVID-19 social restrictions on mental
wellbeing of health professional students during placement is largely
unknown. Conventional survey methods do not capture emotional
fluctuations. Increasing use of smartphones suggests short message
service (SMS) functionality could provide easy, rapid data. This project
tested the feasibility and validity of gathering data on Therapeutic
Radiography student mental wellbeing during clinical placement via emoji
and SMS.
Methods: Participants provided anonymous daily emoji responses via
WhatsApp to a dedicated mobile phone. Additional weekly prompts sought
textual responses indicating factors impacting on wellbeing. A short
anonymous online survey validated responses and provided feedback on the
method.
Results: Participants (n = 15) provided 254 daily responses using 108
different emoji; these triangulated with weekly textual responses.
Feedback concerning the method was positive. `Happy' emoji were used
most frequently; social interaction and fatigue were important wellbeing
factors. Anonymity and opportunity to feedback via SMS were received
positively; ease and rapidity of response engendered engagement
throughout the 3-week study.
Conclusions: The use of emoji for rapid assessment of cohort mental
wellbeing is valid and potentially useful alongside more formal
evaluation and support strategies. Capturing simple wellbeing responses
from a cohort may facilitate the organisation of timely support
interventions.},

 abstract = {This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of eHealth-delivered
interventions for adults who undergo bariatric surgery on postoperative
weight loss, weight loss maintenance, eating psychopathology, quality of
life, depression screening, and self-efficacy. Six electronic databases
were searched, with 14 studies (across 17 reports) included, involving
1633 participants. With substantial heterogeneity, qualitative
descriptions have been provided. Interventions were delivered via an
online program or internet modules (n = 2), telephone (n = 2), text
messages (n = 2), videoconferencing (n = 3), mobile application (n = 1),
and audiovisual media (n = 1). Three studies included a combination,
including internet modules and telephone (n = 1), wireless fidelity
scales, emails, and telephone (n = 1), and a combination of online
treatment, weekly emails, and access to a private Facebook group (n =
1). All the eHealth interventions, except for one, implemented behavior
change techniques, including self-monitoring, problem solving, social
support, goal setting, and shaping knowledge. Both eHealth intervention
and control groups lost weight across the included studies, and eHealth
was found to be as effective as or more effective than the control for
weight loss. Two studies measured weight loss maintenance; both eHealth
and control groups regained weight in the longer term. The interventions
showed significant improvement on assessment measures for eating
psychopathology. In conclusion, when bariatric surgery patients have
limited or no access to healthcare teams or require additional support,
eHealth may be a suitable option. Future studies implementing eHealth
interventions would benefit from reporting intervention components as
per the behavior change techniques taxonomy and further consideration of
delivering eHealth in a stepped care approach would be beneficial. (C)

 abstract = {Body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs), like face-touching or
skin-picking, are hand-driven behaviors which can damage one's
appearance, if not identified early and treated. Technology for
automatic detection is still under-explored, with few previous works
being limited to wearables with single modalities (e.g., motion). Here,
we propose a multi-sensory approach combining motion, orientation, and
heart rate sensors to detect BFRBs. We conducted a feasibility study in
which participants (N=10) were exposed to BFRBs-inducing tasks, and
analyzed 380 mins of signals(1) under an extensive evaluation of sensing
modalities, cross-validation methods, and observation windows. Our
models achieved an AUC > 0.90 in distinguishing BFRBs, which were more
evident in observation windows 5 mins prior to the behavior as opposed
to 1-min ones. In a follow-up qualitative survey, we found that not only
the timing of detection matters but also models need to be
context-aware, when designing just-in-time interventions to prevent
BFRBs.},

 abstract = {Objectives To explore patients' and healthcare practitioners' (HCPs)
views about non-adherence to hypertension medication and potential
content of a combined very brief face-to-face discussion (VBI) and
digital intervention (DI).
Methods A qualitative study (N=31): interviews with patients with
hypertension (n=6) and HCPs (n=11) and four focus groups with patients
with hypertension (n=14). Participants were recruited through general
practices in Eastern England and London. Topic guides explored reasons
for medication non-adherence and attitudes towards a potential
intervention to support adherence. Stimuli to facilitate discussion
included example SMS messages and smartphone app features, including
mobile sensing. Analysis was informed methodologically by the constant
comparative approach and theoretically by perceptions and practicalities
approach.
Results Participants' overarching explanations for non-adherence were
non-intentional (forgetting) and intentional (concerns about side
effects, reluctance to medicate). These underpinned their views on
intervention components: messages that targeted forgetting medication or
obtaining prescriptions were considered more useful than messages
providing information on consequences of non-adherence. Tailoring the DI
to the individuals' needs, regarding timing and number of messages, was
considered important for user engagement. Patients wanted control over
the DI and information about data use associated with any location
sensing. While the DI was considered limited in its potential to address
intentional non-adherence, HCPs saw the potential for a VBI in
addressing this gap, if conducted in a non-judgemental manner.
Incorporating a VBI into routine primary care was considered feasible,
provided it complemented existing GP practice software and HCPs received
sufficient training.
Conclusions A combined VBI-DI can potentially address intentional and
non-intentional reasons for non-adherence to hypertension medication.
For optimal engagement, recommendations from this work include a VBI
conducted in a non-judgmental manner and focusing on nonintentional
factors, followed by a DI that is easy-to-use, highly tailored and with
provision of data privacy details about any sensing technology used.},

 abstract = {Background: Web-based interventions can help address challenges of
accessibility and availability of dietary support for people with type 2
diabetes (T2D). However, concerns regarding adherence and engagement in
web-based interventions have been noted. Implementing a user-centered
approach to intervention development has been shown to encourage better
participant engagement. The overarching aim of this paper was to
describe the user-centered approach used in the T2Diet Study to develop
a new web-based dietary intervention for adults with T2D, exploring
strategies for enhancing adherence and engagement.
Methods: Intervention development was based on a flexible iterative
user-centered approach to enable new product development. Twenty-one
adults with T2D were engaged in six guided discussion groups across four
iterative development phases, alongside reference to evidence and theory
throughout the process. The phases of user inquiry progressed from broad
discussion on areas to support dietary needs; to design feedback on
aspects of site layout; through to further feedback on aesthetics and
functionality; then into a two-week field test followed by final user
inquiry and participation in user experience polls. A hybrid approach of
thematic data analysis was used, incorporating both a data-driven
inductive approach and a deductive approach based on a priori
identification of themes.
Results: Group discussion across the four phases highlighted factors the
participants considered may motivate them to adhere and engage, which
predominantly included relevance of resources, clear and simple positive
communication, and flexibility for personal tailoring. Participant
feedback provided an actionable list of intervention developments and
input to inform intervention structure and theoretical framework. The
two-week field test highlighted factors participants valued in terms of
the user experience, most notably usability and accessibility.
Additionally, the field test indicated a positive user experience, with
no significant usability issues identified.
Conclusion: This paper provided the first detailed report of a
user-centered approach to iterative development in the context of a
web-based T2D dietary intervention. The insights will be useful to
inform future digitally-delivered dietary interventions for adults with
T2D or to inform a similar user-centered approach for other chronic
health conditions.},

 abstract = {Health promotion is to enable people to take control over their health.
Digital health with mHealth empowers users to establish proactive
health, ubiquitously. The users shall have increased control over their
health to improve their life by being proactive. To develop proactive
health with the principles of prediction, prevention, and ubiquitous
health, artificial intelligence with mHealth can play a pivotal role.
There are various challenges for establishing proactive mHealth. For
example, the system must be adaptive and provide timely interventions by
considering the uniqueness of the user. The context of the user is also
highly relevant for proactive mHealth. The context provides parameters
as input along with information to formulate the current state of the
user. Automated decision-making is significant with user-level
decision-making as it enables decisions to promote well-being by
technological means without human involvement. This paper presents a
design framework of AI-enabled proactive mHealth that includes automated
decision-making with predictive analytics, Just-in-time adaptive
interventions and a P5 approach to mHealth. The significance of
user-level decision-making for automated decision-making is presented.
Furthermore, the paper provides a holistic view of the user's context
with profile and characteristics. The paper also discusses the need for
multiple parameters as inputs, and the identification of sources e.g.,
wearables, sensors, and other resources, with the challenges in the
implementation of the framework. Finally, a proof-of-concept based on
the framework provides design and implementation steps, architecture,
goals, and feedback process. The framework shall provide the basis for
the further development of AI-enabled proactive mHealth.},

@article{WOS:000787882800001,
 abstract = {Background:There is increasing evidence on the exponential use of
technology-based social media in medical field that has led to a
proliferation of unprofessional behaviors in digital realm. Educating,
training, and changing the behaviors of healthcare professionals are
essential elements to restrain the rising unprofessional incidents.
Therefore, this research was designed to determine the impact of an
interventional workshop on the medical and dental students in improving
their professional behaviors in the digital world using the newly
developed medical Education e-Professionalism (MEeP) framework.
MethodsWe adopted the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a benchmark
reference which explores constructs intertwined with the mission-based
MEeP framework; values (whistleblowing-raising concerns), behaviors
(being responsible in the digital world) and identity (reflective
practice in the digital world). A multicentre 3-phased mixed-method
study was conducted using a pre-workshop survey, an online
interventional workshop, and a post-workshop survey. SPSS and NVivo were
the tools used for the data analysis. ResultsA total of 130 students
registered for workshop out of which 120 completed the pre-workshop
survey, 62 joined the workshop and 59 completed the workshop and
post-workshop survey. From the whistleblowing - raising concern
perspective, we found that attitudes and perceived behavioral control
had a significant relationship. While for responsible in digital world
category, attitude and perceived behavioral control had a significant
bearing on the intentions. Third, for reflective practice, attitude and
subjective norms significantly enhanced the intention of participants. A
multi layered thematic analysis yielded four overarching themes of
attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and
intentions. Most students showed positive attitudes of being reflective,
self-directed, and humane. Students realized the subjective norms had
made them conscientious, self-aware and conformative. While perceived
behavioural control manifested as identity and Intentions were heavily
reliant on self-actualization. ConclusionOur mixed method study found
that the interventional workshop using MEeP framework significantly
improved attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and
intentions. This study provides valuable evidence of MEeP framework
evaluation using the theoretical underpinning of TPB by reporting
positive changes in professional values, behaviors, and identities of
undergraduate medical and dental students.},

 abstract = {The practice of therapeutic skills outside of sessions in which they are
learned is one presumed key component of cognitive behavioral therapy
(CBT). Yet, our understanding of how skills practice relates to clinical
outcomes remains limited. Here, we explored patients' emotional
responses to CBT skills practice in a pilot study pairing
smartphone-app-delivered skills reminders and guided practice
(ecological momentary intervention {[}EMI]) using ecological momentary
assessment (EMA). Participants (n = 25) were adults recently
hospitalized for a suicide attempt or severe suicidal thinking. They
received brief inpatient CBT (1 to 3 sessions covering core CBT skills
from the Unified Protocol), followed by 1 month of EMI and EMA after
discharge. On average, participants reported modest reductions in
negative affect after skills use (i.e., immediate responses; median time
elapsed = 4.30 minutes). Additionally, participants tended to report
less negative affect when the timepoint preceding the current assessment
included EMI skills practice, rather than EMA alone (i.e., delayed
responses; median time elapsed between prompts = 2.17 hours). Immediate
effects were unrelated to longer-term clinical outcomes, whereas greater
delayed effects were associated with lower symptom severity at
follow-up. Future studies should further examine how CBT skills use in
daily life may alleviate symptoms.},

 abstract = {Background: Adolescence is a period of both great social change, and of
vulnerability to psychiatric distress. However, little is known about
the associations between early psychopathology and social interactions
at the fundamental level of daily life. To better understand the social
correlates of subclinical psychopathology in adolescence, we assessed
associations between general psychopathology and the quantity and
quality of daily-life social interactions.
Methods: During a six-day experience sampling period, adolescent and
young adult participants in Study 1 (n = 663) and Study 2 (n = 1027)
reported the quantity and quality of their everyday social interactions.
General psychopathology was assessed using the Symptom Checklist-90 and
Brief Symptom Inventory-53. The rela-tionship between psychopathology
and each outcome variable was tested in separate multilevel linear and
lo-gistic regression models.
Results: General psychopathology was associated with social interaction
quality. Associations between psychopa-thology and the number of social
interactions were less apparent: In Study 1, participants with more
psychopa-thology were not more alone, whereas Study 2 participants with
higher levels of psychopathology were alone more. Limitations:
Limitations include no separate investigation of distinct types of
psychopathology, and relatively low compliance to the experience
sampling in Study 2.
Conclusions: Consistent associations between subclinical psychopathology
and the quality of social interactions support the fundamentally social
nature of early psychopathology. Moreover, negative experiences of
social interactions may be more valuable markers of early
psychopathology than a reduced quantity of social behaviors.
Conceptualizations of daily-life social functioning, and
prevention/intervention efforts would benefit from a greater
consideration of the quality of everyday social experiences.},

 abstract = {Despite their potential as a scalable, cost-effective intervention
format, self-guided Internet-based interventions for eating disorder
(ED) symptoms continue to be associated with suboptimal rates of
adherence and retention. Improving this may depend on the design of an
Internet intervention and its method of content delivery, with
interactive programs expected to be more engaging than static,
text-based programs. However, causal evidence for the added benefits of
interactive functionality is lacking. We conducted a randomized
controlled comparison of an Internet-based intervention for ED symptoms
with and without interactive functionality. Participants were randomized
to a 4-week interactive (n = 148) or static (n = 145) version of an
Internet-based, cognitive-behavioral program. The interactive version
included diverse multimedia content delivery channels (video tutorials,
graphics, written text), a smart phone app allowing users to complete
the required homework exercises digitally (quizzes, symptom tracking,
self assessments), and progress monitoring features. The static version
delivered identical intervention content but only via written text, and
contained none of those interactive features. Dropout rates were high
overall (58\%), but were significantly-yet slightly-lower for the
interactive (51\%) compared to the static intervention (65\%). There
were no significant differences in adherence rates and symptom level
improvements between the two conditions. Adding basic interactive
functionality to a digital intervention may help with study retention.
However, present findings challenge prior speculations that interactive
features are crucial for enhancing user engagement and symptom
improvement.},

 abstract = {Background: Digital health interventions could help to prevent
age-related diseases, but little is known about how older adults engage
with such interventions, especially in the long term, or whether
engagement is associated with changes in clinical, behavioral, or
biological outcomes in this population. Disparities in engagement levels
with digital health interventions may exist among older people and be
associated with health inequalities.
Objective: This study aimed to describe older adults' engagement with an
eHealth intervention, identify factors associated with engagement, and
examine associations between engagement and changes in cardiovascular
and dementia risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, physical
activity, diet, and cardiovascular and dementia risk scores).
Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the 18-month randomized
controlled Healthy Ageing Through Internet Counselling in the Elderly
trial of a tailored internet-based intervention encouraging behavior
changes, with remote support from a lifestyle coach, to reduce
cardiovascular and cognitive decline risk in 2724 individuals aged >= 65
years, recruited offline in the Netherlands, Finland, and France.
Engagement was assessed via log-in frequency, number of lifestyle goals
set, measurements entered and messages sent to coaches, and percentage
of education materials read. Clinical and biological data were collected
during in-person visits at baseline and 18 months. Lifestyle data were
self-reported on a web-based platform.
Results: Of the 1389 intervention group participants, 1194 (85.96\%)
sent at least one message. They logged in a median of 29 times, and set
a median of 1 goal. Higher engagement was associated with significantly
greater improvement in biological and behavioral risk factors, with
evidence of a dose-response effect. Compared with the control group, the
adjusted mean difference (95\% CI) in 18-month change in the primary
outcome, a composite z-score comprising blood pressure, BMI, and
cholesterol, was -0.08 (-0.12 to -0.03), -0.04 (-0.08 to 0.00), and 0.00
(-0.08 to 0.08) in the high, moderate, and low engagement groups,
respectively. Low engagers showed no improvement in any outcome measures
compared with the control group. Participants not using a computer
regularly before the study engaged much less with the intervention than
those using a computer up to 7 (adjusted odds ratio 5.39, 95\% CI
2.66-10.95) or >= 7 hours per week (adjusted odds ratio 6.58, 95\% CI
3.21-13.49). Those already working on or with short-term plans for
lifestyle improvement at baseline, and with better cognition, engaged
more.
Conclusions: Greater engagement with an eHealth lifestyle intervention
was associated with greater improvement in risk factors in older adults.
However, those with limited computer experience, who tended to have a
lower level of education, or who had poorer cognition engaged less.
Additional support or forms of intervention delivery for such
individuals could help minimize potential health inequalities associated
with the use of digital health interventions in older people.},

 abstract = {Livelihood vulnerability assessment has become an important policy tool
for identifying groups in need of immediate intervention. Based on
survey data covering 427 households in the Hulunbuir Grasslands in
northern China, an indicator-based livelihood vulnerability assessment
system (LVAS) was established by combining the sustainable livelihood
framework and the exposure-sensitivity-adaptation framework, which
described the livelihood vulnerability of households across the
household life cycle in terms of the dimensions of exposure,
sensitivity, and adaptation. A multiple linear regression model was used
to identify the key variables that determine livelihood vulnerability.
The results show that the livelihoods of pastoral households in the
Hulunbuir Grasslands are moderately vulnerable overall, with a high
level of exposure, a medium level of sensitivity, and a low level of
adaptive capacity. As the household life cycle progresses (from the
starting period to the empty-nest period), the adaptive capacity of
pastoral households gradually decreases, and their livelihood
vulnerability increases. The variables that most exacerbate the
vulnerability of pastoral households' livelihoods in this region are
policy-ecological risks, climate-disaster risks and socioeconomic risks,
and the main ways to reduce vulnerability are to improve these
households' productive capital, diversify their sources of livelihood,
and improve their access to information. The results of the study
provide empirical support for similar settings in different regions
worldwide that aim to achieve a ``win-win{''} situation of ecological
conservation and sustainable livelihood development.},

 abstract = {Objectives: To explore associations of screen time (total, mobile
gaming) with sleep problems in Chinese young adults.Methods: This was a
4-week daily morning (completion rate = 82.1\%, 909/1107) and evening
(completion rate = 92.4\%, 1061/1148) assessment study in 41 university
students (22 female, mean age = 22.3 {[}SD 4.2] years). Short sleep
duration < 7 h, difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining
sleep, early morning awakening, and any of these three insomnia symptoms
were self-reported in the morning. Mobile gaming time was self-reported
in the evening, whilst total screen time was objectively tracked.
Bayesian multilevel mixed-effects modeling disaggregated between- and
within-person associations.Results: Between person, longer mobile gaming
time predicted short sleep duration (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 1.90,
95\% CI 1.39, 2.69), any insomnia symptoms (AOR = 1.59, 95\% CI 1.20,
2.11), difficulty initiating sleep (AOR = 3.05, 95\% CI 1.51, 6.24), and
difficulty maintaining sleep (AOR = 2.19, 95\% CI 1.18, 3.74). Short
sleep duration (adjusted b = 0.99, 95\% CI 0.05, 1.95), any insomnia
symptoms (adjusted b = 1.19, 95\% CI 0.24, 1.94), and difficulty
initiating sleep (adjusted b = 1.72, 95\% CI 0.11, 3.19) reversely
increased mobile gaming time. Within person, any insomnia symptoms
(adjusted b = 0.17, 95\% CI 0.04, 0.31) and early morning awakening
(adjusted b = 0.28, 95\% CI 0.08, 0.48) increased next-day mobile gaming
time. Total screen time was not associated with sleep problems both
between and within person.Conclusions: Bidirectional between-person
associations of mobile gaming time with short sleep duration and
insomnia symptoms informed multiple-health-behavior-change
interventions. Unidirectional within-person associations of insomnia
symptoms with next-day mobile gaming time informed just-in-time adaptive
interventions addressing daily variations in insomnia symptoms.

 abstract = {Introduction: The use of social media for self-management of health
information is a recurrent practice for lay users who experience
different health contexts. Although social media facilitate information
access and sharing, they can contribute to the emergence of possible
risks to health and well-being, as they increase emotional vulnerability
and misinformation experiences. Objective: To discover current evidence
impacting the beneficial use of social media for health information
purposes; the investigation sought to examine how barriers to health
information on social media perceived by lay users are presented in
recent empirical research. Method: A qualitative exploratory research
was carried out through a literature review on the SCOPUS database.
Results: Although the barriers are multiple and vary according to health
contexts and situational motivations, they can be articulated in a mesh
composed of the following meta-barriers: diasporic, misinformation,
literacy, interaction, and emotional. Conclusion: The study concluded
that the presented mesh of barriers, associated with other structural
barriers, can contribute to the construction of research instruments and
digital interventions involving the use of social media for health
information purposes.},

 abstract = {Objectives College is an exhilarating but stressful time often
associated with mental distress. The StudiCare project offers Internet-
and mobile-based interventions (IMI) for college student mental health
promotion. Within this framework, we evaluated the IMI StudiCare
Mindfulness, and examined potential moderators and mediators of
effectiveness.
Methods In this randomized controlled trial, 150 college students with
low to moderate mindfulness were randomly assigned to StudiCare
Mindfulness or a waitlist control group (WL). StudiCare Mindfulness
comprises 5 weekly online modules based on Acceptance Commitment Therapy
and stress management. Assessments took place before (t0) and 6 weeks
after (t1) randomization. Primary outcome was mindfulness. Secondary
outcomes were stress, depression, anxiety, quality of life, intervention
satisfaction, and adherence. Sociodemographic variables,
pre-intervention symptomatology, personality traits, and attitudes
towards IMI were examined as potential moderators.
Results Intention-to-treat analyses (N = 149) showed a large effect of
StudiCare Mindfulness on mindfulness (d = 1.37; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.73)
compared to WL at t1 (beta = 1.18; 95\% CI: 0.96-1.40). Effects on
secondary outcomes were significant in favor of the intervention group
except for physical quality of life. Mindfulness was found to mediate
intervention effectiveness on depression, anxiety, and stress.
Moderation analysis was non-significant except for baseline openness to
experience, with lower openness associated with larger intervention
effects on mindfulness.
Conclusions This trial suggests that StudiCare Mindfulness may enhance
mindfulness and reduce mental health problems. Its potential
applicability as low-threshold prevention and treatment option on a
population level should be subject to future trials.},

 abstract = {Background Early warning signs monitoring by service users with
schizophrenia has shown promise in preventing relapse but the quality of
evidence is low. We aimed to establish the feasibility of undertaking a
definitive randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of
a blended digital intervention for relapse prevention in schizophrenia.
Methods This multicentre, feasibility, cluster randomised controlled
trial aimed to compare Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in
psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER)
with treatment as usual in community mental health services (CMHS) in
Glasgow and Melbourne. CMHS were the unit of randomisation, selected on
the basis of those that probably had five or more care coordinators
willing to participate. Participants were eligible if they were older
than 16 years, had a schizophrenia or related diagnosis confirmed via
case records, were able to provide informed consent, had contact with
CMHS, and had had a relapse within the previous 2 years. Participants
were randomised within stratified clusters to EMPOWER or to continue
their usual approach to care. EMPOWER blended a smartphone for active
monitoring of early warning signs with peer support to promote
self-management and clinical triage to promote access to relapse
prevention. Main outcomes were feasibility, acceptability, usability,
and safety, which was assessed through face-to-face interviews. App
usage was assessed via the smartphone and self-report. Primary end point
was 12 months. Participants, research assistants and other team members
involved in delivering the intervention were not masked to treatment
conditions. Assessment of relapse was done by an independent
adjudication panel masked to randomisation group. The study is
registered at ISRCTN (99559262).
Findings We identified and randomised eight CMHS (six in Glasgow and two
in Melbourne) comprising 47 care coordinators. We recruited 86 service
users between Jan 19 and Aug 8, 2018; 73 were randomised (42 158\%1 to
EMPOWER and 31 142\%] to treatment as usual). There were 37 (51\%) men
and 36 (49\%) women. At 12 months, main outcomes were collected for 32
(76\%) of service users in the EMPOWER group and 30 (97\%) of service
users in the treatment as usual group. Of those randomised to EMPOWER,
30 (71\%) met our a priori criterion of more than 33\% adherence to
daily monitoring that assumed feasibility. Median time to
discontinuation of these participants was 31-S weeks (SD 14.5). There
were 29 adverse events in the EMPOWER group and 25 adverse events in the
treatment as usual group. There were 13 app-related adverse events,
affecting 11 people, one of which was serious. Fear of relapse was lower
in the EMPOWER group than in the treatment as usual group at 12 months
(mean difference -7.53 (95\% CI -14.45 to 0.60; Cohen's d-0.53).
Interpretation A trial of digital technology to monitor early warning
signs blended with peer support and clinical triage to detect and
prevent relapse appears to be feasible, safe, and acceptable. A further
main trial is merited. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

 abstract = {Awake bruxism (AB) is differentiated from sleep bruxism (SB) by the
differences in etiology, comorbidities, and consequences related to the
different spectrum of muscle activities exerted in relation to the
different circadian manifestations. Furthermore, less literature data
are available on AB than on SB. The introduction of ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) strategies has allowed for collecting valuable data on
the frequency of the different activities reported by an individual in
his/her natural environment. This strategy has been further improved
with the recent use of smartphone technologies. Recent studies have
described an average frequency of AB behaviors, within the range of
23-40\% for otherwise healthy young adults. An association between AB
and some psychological traits has emerged, and the findings have
indicated that patients with musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g.,
temporomandibular joint and/or muscle pain, muscle stiffness, and
fatigue) report higher AB frequencies. Preliminary data suggest that
muscle bracing and teeth contact are the most commonly reported
behaviors, while teeth clenching is much less frequently reported than
commonly believed previously. Report of teeth grinding during
wakefulness is almost absent. This paper has critically reviewed the
currently available approaches for the assessment of AB. In addition,
some future perspectives and suggestions for further research have been
provided.},

 abstract = {To increase access to support, an online psychosocial support tool for
adults with visible differences was adapted for use without referral or
supervision. This intervention combines a cognitive behavioural and
social skills model of support. This study aimed to assess the usability
and acceptability of Face IT@home as a self-help intervention.
Eighty-one participants were recruited (32 with visible differences).
Stage 1 included 14 participants (11 female, all with visible
differences) who viewed two sessions of Face IT@home and undertook a
semi-structured telephone interview. Stage 2 consisted of 14 thinkaloud
sessions (13 female, none with visible differences) with participants,
supervised by researchers. Stage 3 employed 53 participants (47 female;
19 with visible differences), to view one session of Face IT@home and
complete an online survey to evaluate usability and acceptability. User
interviews, think-aloud studies and questionnaires identified usability
and acceptability factors of Face IT@home that make it fit for purpose
as a self-help tool. Participants suggested some changes to the Face
IT@home program to improve usability. Participants reported that Face
IT@home was a useful tool for people with visible differences and could
be effective. The CBT-based model was considered a useful approach to
addressing psychosocial concerns. The online self-help format will
increase access to psychological support for adults with visible
differences.
Key learning aims
(1) The paper outlines an important cognitive behavioural framework for
supporting adults with visible differences.
(2) The paper demonstrates the importance of user testing and client
involvement in developing intervention models.
(3) The studies highlight one approach to the process of user testing
that can produce a robust online intervention.},

@article{WOS:000854077500042,
 abstract = {Background: Mobile apps have shown considerable promise for reducing
alcohol consumption among problem drinkers, but like many mobile health
apps, they frequently report low utilization, which is an important
limitation, as research suggests that effectiveness is related to higher
utilization. Interactive chatbots have the ability to provide a
conversational interface with users and may be more engaging and result
in higher utilization and effectiveness, but there is limited research
into this possibility.
Objective: This study aimed to develop a chatbot alcohol intervention
based on an empirically supported app (Step Away) for reducing drinking
and to conduct a pilot trial of the 2 interventions. Included
participants met the criteria for hazardous drinking and were interested
in reducing alcohol consumption. The study assessed utilization patterns
and alcohol outcomes across the 2 technology conditions, and a waitlist
control group.
Methods: Participants were recruited using Facebook advertisements.
Those who met the criteria for hazardous consumption and expressed an
interest in changing their drinking habits were randomly assigned to
three conditions: the Step Away app, Step Away chatbot, and waitlist
control condition. Participants were assessed on the web using the
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Adapted for Use in the United
States, Readiness to Change Questionnaire, Short Inventory of
Problems-Revised, and Timeline Followback at baseline and at 12 weeks
follow-up.
Results: A total of 150 participants who completed the baseline and
follow-up assessments were included in the final analysis. ANOVA results
indicated that participants in the 3 conditions changed their drinking
from baseline to follow-up, with large effect sizes noted (ie,.2=0.34
for change in drinks per day across conditions). However, the
differences between groups were not significant across the alcohol
outcome variables. The only significant difference between conditions
was in the readiness to change variable, with the bot group showing the
greatest improvement in readiness (F2,147=5.6; P=.004;.2=0.07). The
results suggested that the app group used the app for a longer duration
(mean 50.71, SD 49.02 days) than the bot group (mean 27.16, SD 30.54
days; P=.02). Use of the interventions was shown to predict reduced
drinking in a multiple regression analysis (beta=.25, 95\% CI 0.00-0.01;
P=.04).
Conclusions: Results indicated that all groups in this study reduced
their drinking considerably from baseline to the 12-week follow-up, but
no differences were found in the alcohol outcome variables between the
groups, possibly because of a combination of small sample size and
methodological issues. The app group reported greater use and slightly
higher usability scores than the bot group, but the bot group
demonstrated improved readiness to change scores over the app group. The
strengths and limitations of the app and bot interventions as well as
directions for future research are discussed.},

 abstract = {There exists a two-way detrimental relationship between climate change
and several agricultural practices. Emissions from the agriculture
sector (e.g. GHG emissions, and release of pesticides, herbicides, and
nutrients) is causing global warming as well as damaging the
environment, and in return climate change is stressing agriculture
globally. The bewildering relationship between adaptative measures and
risk of maladaptive outcomes demands a better understanding concerning
``What, where and how to implement{''} adaptive measures. This article
is one step towards a deeper understanding of ``what{''}, ``where{''}
and ``how{''} related questions on climate change adaptation in
connection to constraints of carrying capacities and risks of
maladaptation. A GIS based framework was employed for generating risk
maps for identification of nutrient surplus and discharge hotspots
``i.e. Where to implement?{''}. Moreover, extensive in-depth interviews
and a questionnaire survey were conducted to explore perceptions on
carrying capacities, resources management, climate change adaptation
measures and risk of maladaptive results, i.e. ``What and how to
implement?{''}. Furthermore, the data collected from the questionnaire
survey and interviews was employed to ameliorate the analytical model,
previously developed, based on the initial work of Juhola et al. (2016)
and Neset et al. (2019a), which could help guide planners, advisors, and
farmers for better understanding of adaptation and maladaptive risks.
The study is expected to assist in developing robust, sustainable and
climate smart adaptive interventions in response to negative climate
change impacts.},

 abstract = {Background Depression treatment might be enhanced by ecological
momentary interventions (EMI) based on self-monitoring and
person-specific feedback. This study is the first to examine the
efficacy of two different EMI modules for depression in routine clinical
practice. Methods Outpatients starting depression treatment at secondary
mental health services (N = 161; MIDS-DEPRESSION = 35.9, s.d. = 10.7;
M-AGE = 32.8, s.d. = 12.1; 46\% male) participated in a pragmatic
randomized controlled trial with three arms. Two experimental groups
engaged in 28 days of systematic self-monitoring (5 times per day), and
received weekly feedback on either positive affect and activities
(Do-module) or negative affect and thinking patterns (Think-module). The
control group received no additional intervention. Participants
completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms (primary outcome),
social functioning, and empowerment before and after the intervention
period, and at four measurements during a 6-month follow-up period.
Results Of the 90 (out of 110) participants who completed the
intervention, 86\% would recommend it. However, the experimental groups
did not show significantly more or faster changes over time than the
control group in terms of depressive symptoms, social functioning, and
empowerment. Furthermore, the trajectories of the two EMI modules were
very similar. Conclusions We did not find statistical evidence that this
type of EMI augments the efficacy of regular depression treatment,
regardless of module content. We cannot rule out that EMIs have a
positive impact on other domains or provide a more efficient way of
delivering care. Nonetheless, EMI's promise of effectiveness has not
materialized yet.},

 abstract = {Background Digital health interventions such as smartphone applications
(mHealth) or Internet resources (eHealth) are increasingly used to
improve the management of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes
mellitus. These digital health interventions can augment or replace
traditional health services and may be paid for using healthcare
budgets. While the impact of digital health interventions for the
management of type 2 diabetes on health outcomes has been reviewed
extensively, less attention has been paid to their economic impact.
Objective This study aims to critically review existing literature on
the impact of digital health interventions for the management of type 2
diabetes on health and social care utilisation and costs. Methods
Studies that assessed the impact on health and social care utilisation
of digital health interventions for type 2 diabetes were included in the
study. We restricted the digital health interventions to information
provision, self-management and behaviour management. Four databases were
searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and EconLit) for articles published
between January 2010 and March 2021. The studies were analysed using a
narrative synthesis approach. The risk of bias and reporting quality
were appraised using the ROBINS-I checklist. Results The review included
22 studies. Overall, studies reported mixed evidence on the impact of
digital health interventions on health and social care utilisation and
costs, and suggested this impact differs according to the healthcare
utilisation component. For example, digital health intervention use was
associated with lower medication use and fewer outpatient appointments,
whereas evidence on general practitioner visits and inpatient admissions
was mixed. Most reviewed studies focus on a single component of
healthcare utilisation. Conclusions The review shows no clear evidence
of an impact of digital health interventions on health and social care
utilisation or costs. Further work is needed to assess the impact of
digital health interventions across a broader range of care utilisation
components and settings, including social and mental healthcare
services.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Opioid use disorders are associated with a high burden of
disease and treatment gap. Digital interventions can be used to provide
psycho-social treatment for opioid use disorders, as an alternative to
or together with face-to-face interventions. This review aimed to assess
the application and effectiveness of digital interventions to treat
opioid use disorder globally.Methods: The study team searched four
electronic databases (PubMed, Psych INFO, Web of Science and Cochrane
Central register of controlled trials). The inclusion criteria were:
randomized controlled trials, assessment for opioid use before and at
least once following intervention, and use of digital interventions. The
primary outcomes were opioid use and/or retention in treatment, with
data being summarized in tables and a narrative review
presented.Results: The initial database search yielded 3542 articles, of
which this review includes 20. Nineteen were conducted among adults in
the United States. The digital interventions used included web-based,
computerbased, telephone calls, video conferencing, automated
self-management system, mobile applications and text messaging. They
were based on therapeutic education systems, community reinforcement
approaches, cognitive behavior therapy, relapse prevention, brief
interventions, supportive counselling and motivational interviewing. The
studies had mixed findings; of the 20 studies, 10 had statistically
significant differences between the treatment groups for opioid
abstinence, and four had significant differences for treatment
retention. Comparisons were difficult due to varying methodologies.
Participants rated the interventions as acceptable and reported high
rates of satisfaction.Conclusion: The use of digital interventions for
opioid use disorder treatment was acceptable, with varying levels of
effectiveness for improving outcomes, which is influenced by participant
and intervention delivery factors. Further studies in different parts of
the world should compare these findings, specifically in low- and
middleincome countries.},

 abstract = {Aims and objectives: Digital teaching, learning and assessment have been
part of medical education and continuing education for decades. The
objective of this review paper is to highlight developments and
perspectives in these areas in the GMS Journal for Medical Education
(GMS JME).Methodology: In the spring of 2020, we conducted a systematic
literat-ure search of the Journal for Medical Education (JME) and
analysed the articles with regard to different categories such as
article type, digital tools used or mode of data collection.Results: Of
the 132 articles analysed, 78 were digital interventions (53 of which
were exploratory-descriptive), 28 were project descriptions, 16 were
surveys of needs or equipment and 10 were concept papers. About
one-third of the studies and project reports each dealt with virtual
patients or case-based learning, whereas no articles were published on
trends such as serious games or virtual reality. Overall, our analysis
shows that in many respects, the studies on digital teaching were more
broadly based, especially between 2006 and 2010, after which this trend
tended to decline again.Conclusions: Our analysis shows that
publications in the JME consider some key aspects of digital teaching in
medical education and continuing education, such as educational videos
or virtual patients. The variability of information and methods of
presentation advocate the use of guidelines to optimise the quality of
scientific papers. Furthermore, clues for future research topics and
experimental study designs are identified.},

Variety Feasibility Trial (NEW Soul @ RV) assessed Reach and
Effectiveness outcomes in participants in a soul food, plant-based
dissemination and implementation study. The research team successfully
partnered with a local restaurant to host and deliver the intervention.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention was delivered using two
intervention groups: virtual synchronous and virtual asynchronous. The
dissemination and implementation feasibility study successfully
recruited African American participants leading to a meaningful primary
outcome in weight loss as well as improvements in a secondary outcome of
diet self-efficacy. Findings emphasize the potential for greater
dissemination and implementation of NEW Soul @ RV throughout African
American vegan soul food restaurants.
A partnership with a local restaurant was formed to disseminate and
implement a plant-based nutrition intervention to virtual synchronous
and virtual asynchronous groups.
Dissemination and implementation (D\&I) studies of dietary interventions
for African Americans are limited. Restaurants may be an innovative
setting to deliver dietary interventions. Purpose: Assess weight loss,
self-efficacy for healthy eating, diet quality, and quality of life in
African Americans in two groups: virtual synchronous and virtual
asynchronous. Guided by RE-AIM, the Nutritious Eating with Soul @ Rare
Variety Cafe Feasibility study included nutrition education,
accountability partners for support, and cooking demonstrations led by a
community health worker and was delivered across two cohorts in a
non-randomized design. The intervention was conducted over 12
consecutive weekly classes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, intervention
delivery was online. African Americans between 18-65 years old with
overweight/obesity, not currently following a plant-based diet or taking
medications to control diabetes, and living in a southeastern city were
recruited. Participants completed in-person weight assessments and
online surveys at baseline and post-intervention. Linear mixed models
analyzed changes in outcomes and differences in 3-month outcomes between
groups. All models controlled for age and sex. Regarding Reach, 199
participants expressed interest, and 60 enrolled. Among the full sample,
participants decreased body weight -2.6 +/- 0.5 kg (p < .0001) and
increased self-efficacy 1.6 +/- 0.7 points (p = .03). No differences in
3-month outcomes between groups were observed. This D\&I feasibility
study successfully recruited participants during the COVID-19 pandemic
and produced significant results. The successful online intervention
delivery compared to in-person suggests the potential for greater D\&I
in vegan soul food restaurants. As restrictions are loosened, future
studies will test in-person delivery.},

@article{WOS:000926129000009,
 abstract = {Objective: Dental anxiety (DA) is a frequent and widespread phenomenon
worldwide. There are few studies that have dis-cussed the preoperative
intervention of dental anxiety. The aim of this study was to explore the
clinical efficacy of an online in-tervention to improve understanding
and reduce dental anxiety in patients with transcrestal sinus floor
elevation (TSFE) and to explore the correlation between patients'
understanding and dental anxiety, pain perception, and satisfaction.
Method and materials: This prospective randomized controlled trial
en-rolled patients who underwent TSFE and simultaneous implant
placement. Patients were randomly allocated to the preopera-tive online
intervention group (test group) and the non-online intervention group
(control group). Two patient interview topic guide questionnaires were
utilized to assess the extent and source of patients'understanding of
the treatment process after a consultation at the hospital (T1) and
prior to the surgery (T2). The preoperative dental anxiety was also
assessed using the modified Corah dental anxiety scale (MDAS) at T1 and
T2. All patients used the visual analog scale to describe their pain
per-ception and satisfaction with the treatment process immedi-ately
after surgery (T3). A correlation analysis was performed to analyze the
interrelationship between patient understanding, dental anxiety, pain
perception, and satisfaction. Results: At T1, both groups were
homogenous in their knowledge of the TSFE procedure and preoperative
dental anxiety. At T2, the test group showed a better understanding of
the TSFE procedure and lower preoperative dental anxiety than that of T1
and the con-trol group at T2. Pain perception was significantly lower in
the test group than in the control group at T3. Patients in the test
group expressed significantly greater satisfaction with the treat-ment
process than the control test group. There was a negative correlation
between patients'understanding and preoperative dental anxiety. A
positive correlation between preoperative dental anxiety and pain
perception was found with a significant difference. Patients'
satisfaction was positively correlated with understanding and negatively
correlated with pain perception. Conclusions: Preoperative online
intervention effectively in-creased patients' understanding of the
treatment process. This resulted in decreased preoperative dental
anxiety, decreased pain perception, and greater postoperative
satisfaction from patients who underwent TSFE. Clinical relevance:Online
med-ical care can be considered as an auxiliary tool to improve the
effect of implant surgery. (Quintessence Int 2022;53: 798-807; doi:

provided to patients during their daily lives and in natural settings.
These types of interventions are often used to improve self-management

EMIs thanks to their ubiquity. EMIs represent a novel approach for the
delivery of psychological support to mental health disorders patients in
daily life. In this work, we discuss current and emerging technologies
and discuss the challenges associated to use them to deliver EMIs in
mental health care. We focus on challenges and opportunities regarding

 abstract = {Understanding caregivers' needs is crucial for service planning and
empowering caregivers around the world. Although research on autism from
Arab countries is emerging, many countries are still unrepresented.
Moreover, within-country disparities are understudied. This study
investigated differences in needs, service use, and satisfaction between
urban or rural living caregivers of autistic children in Morocco. The
``Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use{''} served as a
conceptual framework to investigate factors associated with receiving
intervention and service satisfaction. Results from a survey among 131
Moroccan caregivers of autistic children revealed similarities and
differences in urban and rural living caregivers' challenges and needs.
Children from urban communities had 12 times higher odds of receiving
intervention despite similar age and verbal ability. Significantly,
fewer children from rural communities attended school as compared with
urban communities. Limited autonomy skills in children were more
challenging to rural caregivers, while limited social-communicational
skills were more challenging to urban caregivers. These differences may
inform healthcare policy-makers and program developers. Adaptive
interventions are important to reflect regional needs, resources, and
practices. Addressing enabling factors such as costs, information
barriers, or stigma may help reduce both global and within-country
disparities in autism care. Lay Abstract It is very important to
understand the needs of caregivers to be able to empower caregivers and
to develop or improve services around the world. Therefore, research in
different regions is needed to understand differences in caregivers
needs between countries, but also between areas within countries. This
study investigated differences in needs and service use between
caregivers of autistic children in Morocco, living in urban and rural
areas. A total of 131 Moroccan caregivers of autistic children took part
in the study and responded to an interview survey. The results showed
both similarities and differences between urban and rural living
caregivers' challenges and needs. Autistic children from urban
communities were much more likely to receive intervention and attend
school than children from rural communities, even though age and verbal
skills of the two groups of children were comparable. Caregivers
expressed similar needs for improved care and education, but different
challenges in caring. Limited autonomy skills in children were more
challenging to rural caregivers, while limited social-communicational
skills were more challenging to urban caregivers. These differences may
inform healthcare policy-makers and program developers. Adaptive
interventions are important to respond to regional needs, resources, and
practices. In addition, the results showed the importance of addressing
challenges as experienced by caregivers such as costs related to care,
barriers in access to information, or stigma. Addressing these issues
may help reduce both global and within-country differences in autism
care.},

 abstract = {People with schizophrenia often experience impaired social functioning
and low satisfaction with relationships. Existing measures of social
impairment in schizophrenia primarily assess pleasure derived from
social interactions, rather than examining impairments in social
motivation, including effortful behavior. We conducted a validation
study of a recently developed self-report measure of social effort in 31
participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including tests of
association with standard assessments of social functioning and behavior
in daily life using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). We also
assessed predictive validity of the scale, measuring the extent to which
social effort at baseline predicted changes in social functioning over a
60-day smartphone-based social intervention. Higher social effort was
associated with greater social functioning and lower negative symptom
severity at baseline. Baseline social effort did not predict changes in
social functioning over the intervention period, nor was it related to
EMA-reported social experiences. Thus, tendencies toward social effort
exertion may capture meaningful variance in gold-standard assessments of
social functioning and negative symptoms, but may not track with social
experiences in daily life. Further research should examine whether
social effort is sensitive to change, and evaluate the utility of
targeting social effort in evidence-based interventions for improving
the social functioning in schizophrenia.},

 abstract = {ObjectiveA holistic understanding of the naturalistic dynamics among
physical activity, sleep, emotions, and purpose in life as part of a
system reflecting wellness is key to promoting well-being. The main aim
of this study was to examine the day-to-day dynamics within this
wellness system.MethodsUsing self-reported emotions (happiness, sadness,
anger, anxiousness) and physical activity periods collected twice per
day, and daily reports of sleep and purpose in life via smartphone
experience sampling, more than 28 days as college students (n = 226
young adults; mean {[}standard deviation] = 20.2 {[}1.7] years) went
about their daily lives, we examined day-to-day temporal and
contemporaneous dynamics using multilevel vector autoregressive models
that consider the network of wellness together.ResultsNetwork analyses
revealed that higher physical activity on a given day predicted an
increase of happiness the next day. Higher sleep quality on a given
night predicted a decrease in negative emotions the next day, and higher
purpose in life predicted decreased negative emotions up to 2 days
later. Nodes with the highest centrality were sadness, anxiety, and
happiness in the temporal network and purpose in life, anxiety, and
anger in the contemporaneous network.ConclusionsAlthough the effects of
sleep and physical activity on emotions and purpose in life may be
shorter term, a sense of purpose in life is a critical component of
wellness that can have slightly longer effects, bleeding into the next
few days. High-arousal emotions and purpose in life are central to
motivating people into action, which can lead to behavior change.},

 abstract = {Effective implementation of an Assets-based mhealth intervention for
families with children may depend on promoting trust, inclusivity, and
ensuring usability, particularly among families with financial
insecurity, Black families, and Hispanic families.
Lay Summary The purpose of our work was to design a program to connect
families with children to existing health-promoting resources in their
communities (i.e., group exercise, food pantries, community gardens). We
specifically wanted to capture the needs and preferences of parents with
children and community-based organizations and determine the possible
barriers to creating this program. Based on prior community listening
sessions, the program, called Assets for Health, would consist of a
mobile app which lists community resources and a community health worker
to help connect families to these resources. We presented the idea for
Assets for Health to a diverse group of parents and community-based
organizations using focus groups and interviews to carefully capture
their thoughts. We then analyzed what was said. This work showed that
parents were struggling to find community programs that fit their needs
and thought a program like Assets for Health could be helpful. Also
organizations were struggling to show families that they could be
trusted and that all families were welcome.
Assets-based interventions can address child health disparities by
connecting families to existing community resources. Community
collaboration when designing interventions may identify barriers and
facilitators to implementation. The objective of this study was to
identify crucial implementation considerations during the design phase
of an asset-based intervention to address disparities in childhood
obesity, Assets for Health. We conducted focus groups and
semi-structured interviews with caregivers of children (<18 years) (N =
17) and representatives of community-based organizations (CBOs) which
serve children and families (N = 20). Focus group and interview guides
were developed based on constructs from the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research. Data were analyzed using rapid qualitative
analysis and matrices were used to identify common themes within and
across groups of community members. Desired intervention characteristics
included an easy-to-use list of community programs that could be
filtered based on caregiver preferences and local community health
workers to promote trust and engagement among Black and Hispanic/Latino
families. Most community members felt an intervention with these
characteristics could be advantageous versus existing alternatives. Key
outer setting characteristics which were barriers to family engagement
included families' financial insecurity and lack of access to
transportation. The CBO implementation climate was supportive but there
was concern that the intervention could increase staff workload beyond
current capacity. Assessment of implementation determinants during the
intervention design phase revealed important considerations for
intervention development. Effective implementation of Assets for Health
may depend on app design and usability, fostering organizational trust
and minimizing the costs and staff workload of caregivers and CBOs,
respectively.},

 abstract = {Background
Melanoma survivors are at increased risk of developing a second primary
melanoma; however, some report sub-optimal sun behaviors and sunburns.
We tested the effectiveness of a wearable device with ultraviolet
radiation (UVR)-sensing technology to improve sun behaviors and reduce
sunburns in cutaneous melanoma survivors.
Materials and methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial using Shade 2, a commercially
available wrist device that measures UVR. The intervention group
received the device and mobile application notifications about their
exposure and prompts to use sunscreen. The control group received the
device and a separate research mobile application without information
about their exposure or notifications. Participants wore the device for
12 weeks and self-reported sun behaviors before, during, and after the
intervention. The primary outcome was a composite score of sun
protection behaviors at week 12.
Results
386 participants were randomized (186 control, 182 intervention). Most
were female and 5+ years past their first melanoma diagnosis. The
average age was 56 years. Most (93\%) completed the study, though 40\%
experienced device issues. No meaningful differences were observed in
self-reported sun protection behaviors at week 12 (controls 3.0 +/- 0.5
vs. intervention 2.9 +/- 0.5, p = 0.06), any sunburn during the
intervention period (controls 14.4\% vs. intervention 12.7\%, p = 0.75),
or average daily objective UVR exposure (controls median 87 vs.
intervention 83 J/m(2), p = 0.43).
Conclusion
Wearing a device that measured and alerted melanoma survivors to UVR
exposure did not result in different sun behaviors, exposure, or
sunburns relative to controls. The technology needs refinement before
further attempts to assess the effectiveness of self-monitoring UVR
exposure.},

 abstract = {Background: As smartphone technology has become nearly ubiquitous, there
is a growing body of literature suggesting that ecological momentary
cognitive testing (EMCT) offers advantages over traditional
pen-and-paper psychological assessment. We introduce a newly developed
platform for the self-administration of cognitive tests in ecologically
valid ways.
Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act-compliant EMCT smartphone-based
platform for the frequent and repeated testing of cognitive abilities in
everyday life. This study examines the psychometric properties of 7
mobile cognitive tests covering domains of processing speed, visual
working memory, recognition memory, and response inhibition within our
platform among persons with and without bipolar disorder (BD).
Ultimately, if shown to have adequate psychometric properties, EMCTs may
be useful in research on BD and other neurological and psychiatric
illnesses.
Methods: A total of 45 persons with BD and 21 demographically comparable
healthy volunteer participants (aged 18-65 years) completed
smartphone-based EMCTs 3 times daily for 14 days. Each EMCT session
lasted approximately 1.5 minutes. Only 2 to 3 tests were administered in
any given session, no test was administered more than once per day, and
alternate test versions were administered in each session.
Results: The mean adherence to the EMCT protocol was 69.7\% (SD 20.5\%),
resulting in 3965 valid and complete tests across the full sample.
Participants were significantly more likely to miss tests on later
versus earlier study days. Adherence did not differ by diagnostic
status, suggesting that BD does not interfere with EMCT participation.
In most tests, age and education were related to EMCT performance in
expected directions. The average performances on most EMCTs were
moderately to strongly correlated with the National Institutes of Health
Toolbox Cognition Battery. Practice effects were observed in 5 tests,
with significant differences in practice effects by BD status in 3
tests.
Conclusions: Although additional reliability and validity data are
needed, this study provides initial psychometric support for EMCTs in
the assessment of cognitive performance in real-world contexts in BD.},

 abstract = {Digitalization is globally transforming the world with profound
implications. It has enormous potential to foster progress toward
sustainability. However, in its current form, digitalization also
continues to enable and encourage practices with numerous unsustainable
impacts affecting our environment, ingraining inequality, and degrading
quality of life. There is an urgent need to identify such multifaceted
impacts holistically. Impact assessment of digital interventions (DIs)
leading to digitalization is essential specifically for Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). Action is required to understand the pursuit
of short-term gains toward achieving long-term value-driven sustainable
development. We need to understand the impact of DIs on various actors
and in diverse contexts. A holistic understanding of the impact will
help us align the visions of sustainable development and identify
potential measures to mitigate negative short and long-term impacts. The
recently developed digitainability assessment framework (DAF) unveils
the impact of DIs with an in-depth context-aware assessment and offers
an evidence-based impact profile of SDGs at the indicator level. This
paper demonstrates how DAF can be instrumental in guiding participatory
action for the implementation of digitainability practices. This paper
summarizes the insights developed during the Digitainable Spring School
2022 (DSS) on ``Sustainability with Digitalization and Artificial
Intelligence,{''} one of whose goals was to operationalize the DAF as a
tool in the participatory action process with collaboration and active
involvement of diverse professionals in the field of digitalization and
sustainability. The DAF guides a holistic context-aware process
formulation for a given DI. An evidence-based evaluation within the DAF
protocol benchmarks a specific DI's impact against the SDG indicators
framework. The participating experts worked together to identify a DI
and gather and analyze evidence by operationalizing the DAF. The four
DIs identified in the process are as follows: smart home technology
(SHT) for energy efficiency, the blockchain for food security,
artificial intelligence (AI) for land use and cover change (LUCC), and
Big Data for international law. Each of the four expert groups addresses
different DIs for digitainability assessment using different techniques
to gather and analyze data related to the criteria and indicators. The
knowledge presented here could increase understanding of the challenges
and opportunities related to digitainability and provide a structure for
developing and implementing robust digitainability practices with
data-driven insights.},

 abstract = {Background: Internet-based mental health interventions have been
demonstrated to be effective in alleviating psychological distress and
promoting mental well-being. However, real-world uptake and engagement
of such interventions have been low. Rather than being stand-alone
interventions, situating internet-based interventions under a stratified
stepped care system can support users to continue with mental health
practice and monitor their mental health status for timely services that
are commensurate with their needs. A user-centered approach should be
used in the development of such web-based platforms to understand the
facilitators and barriers in user engagement to enhance platform uptake,
usability, and adherence so it can support the users' continued adoption
and practice of self-care for their mental health.Objective: The aim of
this study was to describe the design process taken to develop a
web-based stratified stepped care mentalhealth platform, TourHeart+,
using a user-centered approach that gathers target users'perceptions on
mental self-care and feedbackon the platform design and incorporates
them into the design.Methods: The process involved a design workshop
with the interdisciplinary development team, user interviews, and 2
usability testing sessions on the flow of registration and mental health
assessment and the web-based self-help interventions of the platform.
The data collected were summarized as descriptive statistics if
appropriate and insights are extracted inductively. Qualitative data
were extracted using a thematic coding approach. Results: In the design
workshop, the team generated empathy maps and point-of-view statements
related to the possible mental health needs of target users. Four user
personas and related processes in the mental health self-care journey
were developed based on user interviews. Design considerations were
derived based on the insights drawn from the personas and mental health
self-care journey. Survey results from 104 users during usability
testing showed that the overall experience during registration and
mental health assessment was friendly, and they felt cared for, although
no statistically significant differences on preference ratings were
found between using a web-based questionnaire tool and through an
interactive chatbot, except that chatbot format was deemed more
interesting. Facilitators of and barriers to registering the platform
and completing the mental health assessment were identified through user
feedback during simulation with mock-ups. In the usability testing for
guided self-help interventions, users expressed pain points in course
adherence, and corresponding amendments were made in the flow and design
of the web-based courses.Conclusions: The design process and findings
presented in the study are important in developing a user-centric
platform to optimize users' acceptance and usability of a web-based
stratified stepped care platform with guided self-help interventions for
mental well-being. Accounting for users' perceptions and needs toward
mental health self-care and their experiences in the design process can
enhance the usability of an evidence-based mental health platform on the
web.},

 abstract = {Background: Maternal and child health (MCH) is a global health concern,
especially impacting low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). Digital
health technologies are creating opportunities to address the social
determinants of MCH by facilitating access to information and providing
other forms of support throughout the maternity journey. Previous
reviews in different disciplines have synthesized digital health
intervention outcomes in LMIC. However, contributions in this space are
scattered across publications in different disciplines and lack
coherence in what digital MCH means across fields.
Objective: This cross-disciplinary scoping review synthesized the
existing published literature in 3 major disciplines on the use of
digital health interventions for MCH in LMIC, with a particular focus on
sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods: We conducted a scoping review using the 6-stage framework by
Arksey and O'Malley across 3 disciplines, including public health,
social sciences applied to health, and human-computer interaction
research in health care. We searched the following databases: Scopus,
PubMed, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Web of
Science, and PLOS. A stakeholder consultation was undertaken to inform
and validate the review.
Results: During the search, 284 peer-reviewed articles were identified.
After removing 41 duplicates, 141 articles met our inclusion criteria:
34 from social sciences applied to health, 58 from public health, and 49
from human-computer interaction research in health care. These articles
were then tagged (labeled) by 3 researchers using a custom data
extraction framework to obtain the findings. First, the scope of digital
MCH was found to target health education (eg, breastfeeding and child
nutrition), care and follow-up of health service use (to support
community health workers), maternal mental health, and nutritional and
health outcomes. These interventions included mobile apps, SMS text
messaging, voice messaging, web-based applications, social media, movies
and videos, and wearable or sensor-based devices. Second, we highlight
key challenges: little attention has been given to understanding the
lived experiences of the communities; key role players (eg, fathers,
grandparents, and other family members) are often excluded; and many
studies are designed considering nuclear families that do not represent
the family structures of the local cultures.
Conclusions: Digital MCH has shown steady growth in Africa and other
LMIC settings. Unfortunately, the role of the community was negligible,
as these interventions often do not include communities early and
inclusively enough in the design process. We highlight key opportunities
and sociotechnical challenges for digital MCH in LMIC, such as more
affordable mobile data; better access to smartphones and wearable
technologies; and the rise of custom-developed, culturally appropriate
apps that are more suited to low-literacy users. We also focus on
barriers such as an overreliance on text-based communications and the
difficulty of MCH research and design to inform and translate into
policy.},

 abstract = {BackgroundWorldwide, alcohol use is a major contributor to the burden of
disease and mortality. A sizeable literature suggests that brief
web-based interventions that incorporate personalized normative and/or
health consequences feedback are effective at reducing alcohol intake.
The relative efficacy of an intervention that also includes
individualized feedback about brain health has not been examined, nor
has the utility of integrating a smartphone app
component.MethodParticipants (N = 436, M-age = 21.27) completed baseline
protocols (n = 178 recorded alcohol use via an app for 14 days) and were
then assigned to one of three feedback conditions using randomized block
allocation with stratification based on the total number of standard
drinks consumed. Control participants received no feedback; Alcohol
Intake Feedback (Alc) participants received personalized information
about their alcohol use; Alcohol Intake plus Cognitive Feedback (AlcCog)
participants received personalized details about alcohol use plus
individualized brain-health information related to impulsivity. The
impact of feedback on alcohol consumption behavior was examined as a
function of feedback condition and hazardous/non-harmful drinking status
(as defined by the World Health Organization) at an 8-week
follow-up.ResultsHazardous drinkers in both the Alc and AlcCog
conditions reduced their alcohol intake by 31\% to 50\% more than those
in the Control condition. Reductions were not related to whether
participants completed web- plus app-based components or web-only
components of the intervention. There was no change in the alcohol
intake of non-harmful drinkers.ConclusionsThis proof-of-concept study
showed that hazardous drinkers respond well to brief electronic
interventions that incorporate personalized normative and/or health
consequences feedback. Further research is required to determine how
best to make impulsivity-related brain-health consequences of drinking
manifest and how to maximize the potential of smartphones apps.},

 abstract = {Background: Exercise referral schemes (ERS) reduce depression but the
additional effect on mental health from web based behavioural support is
unknown. The e-coachER trial reported no effect of augmenting usual ERS
with theory driven web-based behavioural support on moderate to vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) at 12 months for patients with chronic physical
and mental health conditions. The present study reports the effects of
the e-coachER intervention on depression, anxiety and MVPA only among
participants with elevated depressive symptoms and investigates whether
these were mediated by changes in MVPA and hypothesised cognitive and
behavioural processes.Methods: Of the original 450 adults recruited into
the e-coachER trial, 205 had at least mild depression, based on the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and were included in the
present analysis. Data collected included the HADS, accelerometer
measured and self-reported MVPA and survey process measures on physical
activity action planning, self-monitoring and goal reviewing, and
perceived importance, confidence, competence, autonomy and support.
Linear mixed models were used to compare groups for change in depression
and anxiety at 4 and 12 months using intention-to-treat complete case
analysis, controlling for baseline. We also examined whether changes in
physical activity and process variables at 4 months mediated changes in
depression and anxiety at 12 months.Results: Of the 205 participants,
138 (67\%) provided follow-up data at four months and 126 (61\%) at 12
months. For those that provided follow-up data, those randomised to
e-coachER reported improved levels of depression (-1.36, 95\% CI:-2.55
to-0.18) but not anxiety, or MVPA, compared with controls at four
months. No differences were observed at 12 months for depression,
anxiety or MVPA. Intervention effects on accelerometer measured or
self-reported MVPA did not mediate improvements in depression or
anxiety. However, intervention effects on confidence, competence and
self-monitoring at four months significantly mediated the reduction in
depression scores at four months. Intervention effects on competence and
self-monitoring at four months also significantly mediated improvements
in anxiety scores at four months.Interpretation: Adding web-based
support to usual ERS leads to reductions in depression but not anxiety
at four months. Changes in depression and anxiety were influenced by
changing people's motivational regulations toward physical activity. The
benefit of adding web-based support to usual ERS on mental health
appears to be from increasing a sense of confidence, competence and
self-monitoring rather than from increasing physical activity in people
with elevated depression. ERS should focus more on strengthening
motivational regulations than just doing more exercise.Trial

attention, is positively associated with job performance, work

valuable catalysts for organizational and individual improvement. Since
the literature on work-related flow interventions is still sparse, this
article aims to provide a foundation for the systematic development of
these interventions. Through a narrative review of the empirical and
theoretical field, we develop a comprehensive framework with three
dimensions, (1) the intervention aim (entering, boosting, or maintaining
flow), (2) the target (context, individual, or group), and (3) the
executor (top-down or bottom-up), for systematically classifying flow
interventions at work. We complement the framework with guiding
questions and concrete starting points for designing novel
interventions. In addition, we explain how to build on these dimensions
when operationalizing flow as the outcome variable in evaluating
intervention effectiveness. By acknowledging individual and situational
variability in flow states and the contingent limitations of flow
interventions, we offer a broad perspective on the potential for
fostering flow at work by using adaptive interventions.},

 abstract = {IntroductionIntelligent ambulatory tracking can assist in the automatic
detection of psychological and emotional states relevant to the mental
health changes of professionals with high-stakes job responsibilities,
such as healthcare workers. However, well-known differences in the
variability of ambulatory data across individuals challenge many
existing automated approaches seeking to learn a generalizable means of
well-being estimation. This paper proposes a novel metric learning
technique that improves the accuracy and generalizability of automated
well-being estimation by reducing inter-individual variability while
preserving the variability pertaining to the behavioral
construct.MethodsThe metric learning technique implemented in this paper
entails learning a transformed multimodal feature space from pairwise
similarity information between (dis)similar samples per participant via
a Siamese neural network. Improved accuracy via personalization is
further achieved by considering the trait characteristics of each
individual as additional input to the metric learning models, as well as
individual trait base cluster criteria to group participants followed by
training a metric learning model for each group.ResultsThe outcomes of
the proposed models demonstrate significant improvement over the other
inter-individual variability reduction and deep neural baseline methods
for stress, anxiety, positive affect, and negative affect.DiscussionThis
study lays the foundation for accurate estimation of psychological and
emotional states in realistic and ambulatory environments leading to
early diagnosis of mental health changes and enabling just-in-time

adults only (over 18 years) and both adolescent and young adults (<25
years)).Methods: Searches for systematic reviews were conducted across
relevant databases including KSR Evidence (), Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of
Effects (DARE; CRD). Records were independently screened by title and
abstract by two reviewers and those deemed eligible were obtained for
full text screening. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with the Risk of
Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool. We employed a
narrative analysis and developed evidence gap maps.Results: Twenty-four
reviews were included with at least one for each sub-population and
employing a range of digital interventions. The quality of evidence was
limited with only one of the 24 of reviews overall judged as low RoB.
Definitions of ``digital intervention{''} greatly varied across
systematic reviews with some reported interventions fitting into more
than one category (i.e., an internet intervention could also be a mobile
phone or computer intervention), however definitions as reported in the
relevant reviews were used. No reviews reported cancer incidence or
related outcomes. Available evidence was limited both by sub-population
and type of intervention, but evidence was most pronounced in
school-aged children. In school-aged children eHealth interventions,
defined as school-based programmes delivered by the internet, computers,
tablets, mobile technology, or tele-health methods, improved outcomes.
Accelerometer-measured (Standardised Mean Difference {[}SMD] 0.33, 95\%
Confidence Interval {[}CI]: 0.05 to 0.61) and self-reported (SMD: 0.14,
95\% CI: 0.05 to 0.23) PA increased, as did fruit and vegetable intake
(SMD: 0.11, 95\% CI: 0.03 to 0.19) (review rated as low RoB, minimal to
considerable heterogeneity across results). No difference was reported
for consumption of fat post-intervention (SMD: -0.06, 95\% CI: -0.15 to
0.03) or sugar sweetened beverages(SSB) and snack consumption combined
post-intervention (SMD: -0.02, 95\% CI:-0.10 to 0.06),or at the follow
up (studies reported 2 weeks to 36 months follow-up) after the
intervention (SMD:-0.06, 95\% CI: -0.15 to 0.03) (review rated low ROB,
minimal to substantial heterogeneity across results). Smartphone based
interventions utilising Short Messaging Service (SMS), app or combined
approaches also improved PA measured using objective and subjective
methods (SMD: 0.44, 95\% CI: 0.11 to 0.77) when compared to controls,
with increases in total PA {[}weighted mean difference (WMD) 32.35 min
per day, 95\% CI: 10.36 to 54.33] and in daily steps (WMD: 1,185, 95\%
CI: 303 to 2,068) (review rated as high RoB, moderate to substantial
heterogeneity across results). For all results, interpretation has
limitations in terms of RoB and presence of unexplained heterogeneity.
Conclusions: This review of reviews has identified limited evidence that
suggests some potential for digital interventions to increase PA and, to
lesser extent, improve nutrition in school-aged children. However,
effects can be small and based on less robust evidence. The body of
evidence is characterised by a considerable level of heterogeneity,
unclear/overlapping populations and intervention definitions, and a low
methodological quality of systematic reviews. The heterogeneity across
studies is further complicated when the age (older vs. more recent),
interactivity (feedback/survey vs. no/less feedback/surveys), and
accessibility (type of device) of the digital intervention is
considered. This underscores the difficulty in synthesising evidence in
a field with rapidly evolving technology and the resulting challenges in
recommending the use of digital technology in public health. There is an
urgent need for further research using contemporary technology and
appropriate methods.},

policyholder's dynamic risk evaluation, incentivizing policyholders to
maintain safe driving behavior in pursuit of a lower insurance premium.
Although post-trip interventions can improve driving behavior
significantly, most interventions do not provide risk mitigation
strategies tailored to long-term driving behavior. This study proposes a
novel approach for driving risk prevention in UBI services, providing
risk analysis services and tailoring driving suggestions for
policyholders. Advanced prediction models and model interpretation
methods were adopted to assess and analyze personal driving risks,
respectively. A multi-objective counterfactual model was developed to
generate risk mitigation strategies for policyholders. The significance
of driving behavior in risk mitigation and its actionability were
assessed to provide realistic and actionable suggestions for
policyholders. The case study, based on a real dataset from an insurance
company in China, showed that the proposed approach can be directly
embedded in the existing UBI service framework to provide personalized
feedback and services to policyholders.},

 abstract = {IMPORTANCE Adherence, both in research trials and in clinical practice,
is crucial to the success of interventions. There is limited guidance on
strategies to increase adherence and the measurement and reporting of
adherence in trials of melanoma self-management practices. OBJECTIVE
This scoping review aimed to describe (1) strategies to improve
adherence to self-management practices in randomized clinical trials of
people at high risk of melanoma and (2) measurement and reporting of
adherence data in these trials. EVIDENCE REVIEW Four databases,
including MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL, were searched from
inception to July 2022. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials
of self-monitoring interventions for early detection of melanoma in
people at increased risk due to personal history (eg, melanoma,
transplant, dysplastic naevus syndrome), family history of melanoma, or
as determined by a risk assessment tool or clinical judgment. FINDINGS
From 939 records screened, 18 eligible randomized clinical trials were
identified, ranging in size from 40 to 724 participants, using a range
of adherence strategies but with sparse evidence on effectiveness of the
strategies. Strategies were classified as trial design (n = 15); social
and economic support (n = 5); intervention design (n = 18); intervention
and condition support (n = 10); and participant support (n = 18). No
strategies were reported for supporting underserved groups (eg, people
who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, have low health literacy,
non-English speakers, or older adults) to adhere to self-monitoring
practices, and few trials targeted provider (referring to both
clinicians and researchers) adherence (n = 5). Behavioral support tools
included reminders (n = 8), priority-setting guidance (n = 5), and
clinician feedback (n = 5). Measurement of adherence was usually by
participant report of skin self-examination practice with some recent
trials of digital interventions also directly measuring adherence to the
intervention through website or application analytic data. Reporting of
adherence data was limited, and fewer than half of all reports mentioned
adherence in their discussion. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using an
adaptation of theWorld Health Organization framework for clinical
adherence, this scoping review of randomized clinical trials identified
key concepts as well as gaps in the way adherence is approached in
design, conduct, and reporting of trials for skin self-examination and
other self-management practices in people at high risk of melanoma.
These findings may usefully guide future trials and clinical practice;
evaluation of adherence strategiesmay be possible using a Study Within A
Trial (SWAT) framework within host trials.},

 abstract = {BackgroundPeople with aphasia (PWA) often suffer from reduced
participation and quality of life. Nevertheless, there are currently
only a few specific interventions that respond to this problem.
Participation and quality of life could be increased by interacting with
peers who have similar experiences. Digital social networks could
stimulate an autonomous interaction. However, digital social networks
need to be adapted to the specific needs of PWA. Therefore, a
participatory, agile process involving the target group should be chosen
to develop such a solution, i.e., an app. The research project consists
of a total of three phases. In the first phase-app development-the app
was developed and programmed including the target group. In the second
phase-app testing-the usability and user-friendliness of the app were
evaluated with four PWA. In the third phase-feasibility and preliminary
efficacy-that will be described in the article, the impact of the app on
PWA will be evaluated.AimsThe overarching aim of our study is to provide
preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Digital social interaction
with other PWA can lead to increased social integration. In addition to
digital interaction, personal encounters between PWA should be
encouraged. As a result, we expect an improvement in quality of life of
PWA. Additionally, we focus on identification of the most appropriate
measurements to discover changes associated with the
intervention.MethodsThe evaluation, which is described in this paper,
takes place in a pre-test - post-test design with a total of n = 48 PWA.
Participants will be recruited in regional clusters to facilitate
face-to-face meetings. Half of the participants will be assigned to the
delayed intervention group and the other half to the immediate
intervention group. Participants in the delayed intervention group will
go through a 3-month waiting period before using the app, while the
participants of the immediate intervention group will start using the
app for 3 months right away. Inclusion criteria are the presence of
chronic aphasia (at least 6 months) and possession of a smartphone with
internet access. Questionnaires on quality of life (SAQOL-39, GHQ-12),
depression (GDS, DISCs), communicative participation (CPIB), and social
support (F-SozU) will be conducted at inclusion (t0), after 3 months of
app use (t1), and after another 3 months for follow-up (t2).
Participants in the delayed intervention group will be assessed twice
before the intervention, before the 3-month waiting period (t0a) and
after the waiting period (t0b). In addition to the quantitative
measures, interviews will take place with 6 to 8 selected participants
after 3 months of app use. Responses will be analysed using Thematic
Analysis.DiscussionThe app will be the first social network tool that is
systematically developed with PWA. Initial indications from the first
phases are that the app can be used by PWA, so that the evaluation of
this app version can take place in the third phase. Results of this
study can provide an initial indication of whether social network
support is a suitable intervention. Findings will help provide
information on the feasibility of digital connectivity for PWA.
Preliminary findings on its impact on the participation and quality of
life of PWA could be made available.},

 abstract = {We intend to evaluate the usability of a mobile app developed for the
self-management of T2DM. A pilot usability cross-sectional study was
performed with a convenience sample of 6 smartphone users aged 45 years.
Participants performed tasks autonomously in a mobile app to assess if
users could complete them and filled out a usability and satisfaction
questionnaire. About half of the tasks had a successful completion rate.
The result of the usability questionnaire was 64/100, below the
acceptable value, but the satisfaction value was considered good. This
study was fundamental as it allowed us to verify which improvements
should be implemented in the next version of the app, contributing to
its better acceptance.},

 abstract = {Although intuitive eating (IE) has become an increasingly adopted
intervention target, current conceptualisations of IE have yet to pivot
away from (neuro)normative physiology and phenomenology. Autistic
individuals commonly report disordered eating behaviours and/or poorer
well-being but appear to benefit from adaptive interventions using an
affirmative approach. This article uses autism as a case example to
summarise challenges related to IE's prevailing conceptualisation,
before proposing how future research and current practice can be
extended to the autistic population. Scholars are encouraged to evaluate
the full 10-principal IE framework while utilising a participatory-led
approach. We argue that research using a mixed methods design is
urgently needed to comprehensively explore the (re)conceptualisation of
IE in autistic people. While IE shows promise for producing positive
outcomes in the autistic population, we discuss the potential challenges
for research and practice due to its current emphasis on accurate
interoception, emotional awareness and processing, and executive
functioning. This suggests the need for research and practice to
integrate autistic needs and experiences into future developments with
an affirmative approach. Public Significance: IE is an effective
intervention for reducing disordered eating behaviours. Autistic
individuals commonly present disordered eating behaviours and have
unique nutritional needs which often require intervention. However,
there is limited understanding of IE among the autistic population.
Research-informed definitions involving autistic perspectives will
support translating the IE framework to this underrepresented
population.},

 abstract = {Simple Summary: The study adapted an existing Web-based intervention,
the Family Gene Toolkit, for Swiss and Korean families that harbor the
genetic changes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
syndrome. The Family Gene Toolkit encourages family communication of
genetic testing results and cascade genetic testing among at-risk
relatives. Feedback from 68 women with genetic changes and 31 clinicians
informed the culturally sensitive adaptation of the content. The
Information Technology team developed the web application that will host
the intervention. Finally, a new sample of 18 women from families with
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer reviewed and evaluated the adapted
content and the functions of the web application. Findings support that
overall, the adapted Family Gene Toolkit is well-designed, has useful
information for these families, and provides interactive content and
illustrative stories. The research team will test if it can increase
rates of cascade testing among at-risk relatives in a subsequent
randomized trial. The study adapted the Family Gene Toolkit and
developed a customized web application for Swiss and Korean families
harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants to support family
communication of genetic testing results and promote cascade genetic
testing among at-risk relatives. In the first step, narrative data from
68 women with BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants and clinician feedback
informed a culturally sensitive adaptation of the content consistent
with current risk management guidelines. In the second step, the
Information Technology team developed the functions and the interface of
the web application that will host the intervention. In the third step,
a new sample of 18 women from families harboring BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic
variants tested the acceptability and usability of the intervention
using ``think-aloud{''} interviews and a questionnaire. Participants
expressed high levels of satisfaction with the intervention. They
provided positive feedback for the information regarding active coping,
strategies to enhance family communication, interactive elements, and
illustrative stories. They reported that the information was useful and
the web application was easy to navigate. Findings suggest that the
Family Gene Toolkit is well-designed and can increase rates of cascade
testing among at-risk relatives. Its efficacy will be tested in a
subsequent randomized trial.},

 abstract = {Nearly all approaches to personalized nutrition (PN) use information
such as the gene variants of individuals to deliver advice that is more
beneficial than a generic ``1-size -fits-all{''} recommendation. Despite
great enthusiasm and the increased availability of commercial services,
thus far, scientific studies have only revealed small to negligible
effects on the efficacy and effectiveness of personalized dietary
recom-mendations, even when using genetic or other individual
information. In addition, from a public health perspective, scholars are
critical of PN because it primarily targets socially privileged groups
rather than the general population, thereby potentially widening health
inequality. Therefore, in this perspective, we propose to extend current
PN approaches by creating adaptive personalized nutrition advice systems
(APNASs) that are tailored to the type and timing of personalized advice
for individual needs, capacities, and receptivity in real-life food
environments. These systems encompass a broadening of current PN goals
(i.e., what should be achieved) to incorporate ``individual goal
preferences{''} beyond currently advocated biomedical targets (e.g.,
making sustainable food choices). Moreover, they cover the
``personal-ization processes of behavior change{''} by providing in
situ, ``just-in-time{''} information in real-life environments (how and
when to change), which accounts for individual capacities and
constraints (e.g., economic resources). Finally, they are concerned with
a ``participatory dialog between individuals and experts{''} (e.g.,
actual or virtual dieticians, nutritionists, and advisors) when setting
goals and deriving measures of adaption. Within this framework, emerging
digital nutrition ecosystems enable continuous, real-time monitoring,
advice, and support in food environments from exposure to consumption.
We present this vision of a novel PN framework along with scenarios and
arguments that describe its potential to efficiently address individual
and population needs and target groups that would benefit most from its
implementation.},

 abstract = {The ability to accurately identify and interpret others' emotions is
critical for social and emotional functioning during adolescence.
Indeed, previous research has identified that laboratory-based indices
of facial emotion recognition and engagement with emotional faces
predict adolescent mood states. Whether socioemotional information
processing relates to real-world affective dynamics using an
ecologically sensitive approach, however, has rarely been assessed. In
the present study, adolescents (N = 62; ages 13-18) completed a Facial
Recognition Task, including happy, angry, and sad stimuli, while EEG
data were acquired. Participants also provided ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) data probing their current level of happiness, anger,
and sadness for 1-week, resulting in indices of emotion (mean-level,
inertia, instability). Analyses focused on relations between (1)
accuracy for and (2) prolonged engagement with (LPP) emotional faces and
EMA-reported emotions. Greater prolonged engagement with happy faces was
related to less resistance to changes in happiness (i.e., less happiness
inertia), whereas greater prolonged engagement with angry faces
associated with more resistance to changes in anger (i.e., greater anger
inertia). Results suggest that socioemotional processes captured by
laboratory measures have real-world implications for adolescent
affective states and highlight potentially actionable targets for novel
treatment approaches (e.g., just-in-time interventions). Future studies
should continue to assess relations among socioemotional informational
processes and dynamic fluctuations in adolescent affective states.
This study evaluated relations between a laboratory measure of
socioemotional information processing and emotion dynamics captured
using smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment over 1 week in
adolescents. Whereas heightened late positive potential (LPP) amplitude
for happy faces was related to less happiness inertia, heightened LPP
amplitude for angry faces was associated with greater anger inertia.
Results highlight potentially important links between laboratory
measures and ecologically sensitive measures of affective dynamics, as
well as possible targets (e.g., just-in-time interventions) for novel
treatment approaches.},

 abstract = {BackgroundMultiple mhealth (mobile health) interventions and mobile
applications have been developed to support diabetes self-management.
However, most of the apps are developed without the need for assessment
and evaluation by experts in the field. This study aimed to design and
develop a mobile application (app) supporting diabetes self-management
for people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) using a systematic
approach.MethodsIn this study mixed method design was used to develop
the mobile application. The mhealth intervention was designed and
developed in five steps: i) Extensive literature search, ii) Needs
assessment of patients with T2D with the help of healthcare providers
and patients (Interviews with 15 healthcare providers like clinicians,
dietitians, and diabetes educators, and 2 focus group discussions with
patients) iii) Ideation and content development of app based on outcomes
of needs assessment; iv) content validation (by 10 healthcare providers)
and v) App development on a hybrid platform. Evaluation of the app by
users i.e., type 2 diabetes patients was done using the users' Mobile
App rating scale (uMARS). The app was evaluated by 40 patients and rated
on the uMARS questionnaire.ResultsA patient-centric mobile app was
developed for the nutritional management of diabetes with three modules:
The patient module, the Evaluation module, and the Healthcare provider
module. The patient module was the app that was provided to the patients
with features like diet, physical activity, blood glucose log,
education, etc., in addition to, a symptom checker, Stress meter blog,
and FAQ. The evaluation module was integrated with the app it works when
a user enters any log, it evaluates the entry against the standard
cutoffs and flash prompts on the screen. The Healthcare provider module
interacts with the server to provide them with patient data, comments,
and feedback.ConclusionsThe users found the app to be satisfactory.
Incorporating additional features to enhance the user interface and
streamline navigation could potentially enhance user engagement, thereby
aiding in the management of T2D.},

 abstract = {Background Stroke rehabilitation consists of restorative and adaptive
approaches. Multiple adaptive approaches exist.Aims/Objectives The
objective of this study was to develop a framework for categorising
adaptive stroke rehabilitation interventions, based on underlying
theory.Material and Methods We searched multiple databases to April 2020
to identify studies of interventions designed to improve participation
in valued activities. We extracted the name of the intervention,
underlying explicit or implicit theory, intervention elements, and
anticipated outcomes. Using this information, we proposed distinct
groups of interventions based on theoretical drivers.Results Twenty-nine
adaptive interventions were examined in at least one of 77 studies.
Underlying theories included Cognitive Learning Theory,
Self-determination Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, adult learning
theories, and Psychological Stress and Coping Theory. Three overarching
theoretical drivers were identified: learning, motivation, and
coping.Conclusions At least 29 adaptive approaches exist, but each
appear to be based on one of three underlying theoretical drivers.
Consideration of effectiveness of these approaches by theoretical driver
could help indicate underlying mechanisms and essential elements of
effective adaptive approaches.Significance Our framework is an important
advance in understanding and evaluating adaptive approaches to stroke
rehabilitation.},

 abstract = {Personalized feedback is important for the learning process, but it is
time consuming and particularly problematic in large-scale courses.
While automatic feedback may help for self-regulated learning, not all
forms of feedback are effective. Social comparison offers powerful
feedback but is often loosely designed. We propose that intertwining
meaningful feedback with well-designed peer comparison using a learning
analytics dashboard provides a solution. Third-year bachelor students
were randomly assigned to have access to the learning analytics
dashboard IguideME (treatment, n=31) or no access (control, n=31).
Dashboard users were asked to indicate their desired grade, which was
used to construct peer-comparison groups. Personalized peer-comparison
feedback was provided via the dashboard. The effects were studied using
quantitative and qualitative data, including the Motivated Strategies
for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and the Achievement Goal Questionnaire
(AGQ). Compared to the control group, the treatment group achieved
higher scores for the MSLQ components ``metacognitive self
-regulation{''} and ``peer learning,{''} and for the AGQ component
``other -approach{''} (do better than others). The treatment group
performed better on reading assignments and achieved higher grades for
high-level Bloom exam questions. These data support the hypothesis that
personalized peer-comparison feedback can be used to improve
self-regulated learning and academic achievement.},

 abstract = {Background The American Psychological Association has identified
information literacy as a crucial component to undergraduate education.
One major barrier to comprehensive information literacy instruction has
been a lack of guidance integrating this into survey courses,
particularly with reduced pedagogical resources available.Objective This
research evaluates the effectiveness of a scaffolded information
literacy curriculum that may be integrated into psychology courses.
Method Students in introductory psychology courses were taught with
either an information literacy curriculum or the typical science-focused
curriculum. Information literacy knowledge was evaluated using a
multiple-choice test.
Results Students who received the specialized curriculum demonstrated
significant improvements on an objective information literacy test by
the end of the course, while students in the control group did
not.Conclusion Evidence suggests that this easily adaptable information
literacy curriculum is effective in meeting psychology information
literacy goals, more so than the traditional science-focused curriculum
taught in introductory psychology classes.
Teaching Implications Instructors and faculty should be encouraged to
utilize this adaptive curriculum, available on Open Science Framework,
as a way of improving information literacy. Other implications,
including feasibility and content, are discussed.},

 abstract = {Mobile health apps are revolutionizing the healthcare ecosystem by
improving communication, efficiency, and quality of service. In low- and
middle-income countries, they also play a unique role as a source of
information about health outcomes and behaviors of patients and
healthcare workers, while providing a suitable channel to deliver both
personalized and collective policy interventions. We propose a framework
to study user engagement with mobile health, focusing on healthcare
workers and digital health apps designed to support them in
resource-poor settings. The behavioral logs produced by these apps can
be transformed into daily time series characterizing each user's
activity. We use probabilistic and survival analysis to build multiple
personalized measures of meaningful engagement, which could serve to
tailor contents and digital interventions suiting each health worker's
specific needs. Special attention is given to the problem of detecting
churn, understood as a marker of complete disengagement. We discuss the
application of our methods to the Indian and Ethiopian users of the Safe
Delivery App, a capacity building tool for skilled birth attendants.
This work represents an important step towards a full characterization
of user engagement in mobile health applications, which can
significantly enhance the abilities of health workers and, ultimately,

 abstract = {IntroductionInnovative health promotion strategies are crucial for
enhancing global quality of life and curbing premature deaths. Digital
health promotion is particularly impactful for young individuals often
using internet-connected devices. Collaborative methodologies in digital
intervention research offer insights into supporting youth during key
life stages, such as adolescence. This review sought to examine the
literature on digital health interventions for youth co-designed via
participatory frameworks.MethodsFollowing the Joanna Briggs Institute
Manual and an adapted Arksey \& O'Malley's 6-stage framework, this
review utilised the PRISMA-ScR checklist for structured reporting.
Peer-reviewed research where young individuals (15-35 years) contributed
to digital health intervention design was analysed. Systematic synthesis
adhered to Braun \& Clarke's Thematic Analysis Guidelines, mapping data
to research queries and thematic framework.ResultsEighteen articles were
systematically synthesised, revealing seven main themes: digital tool,
inquiry field, report aim, participatory activities, intervention
attributes and behavioural change support. Seventeen distinctive digital
health interventions were assessed, mostly within risk mitigation and
mental health domains. Predominantly, interventions were web-based, with
mental wellness websites emerging as the prevalent tool. User experience
testing stood out as the primary reported outcome.ConclusionSeveral
innovative digital health interventions targeting youth have been
identified. Platforms including social media, specialised apps, websites
and video games are instrumental for health advice and clinical support
dissemination, overcoming access and cost barriers. Participatory
techniques are integral for the efficacy of digital health resources,
encompassing youth aspirations and anticipations. Continued efforts will
enrich comprehension of optimal practices in digital health promotion
and intervention formulation.},

 abstract = {BackgroundBlack and Latinx populations are disproportionately affected
by stroke and are likely to experience gaps in health care. Within
fragmented care systems, remote digital solutions hold promise in
reversing this pattern. However, there is a digital divide that follows
historical disparities in health. Without deliberate attempts to address
this digital divide, rapid advances in digital health will only
perpetuate systemic biases. This study aimed to characterize the range
of digital health interventions for stroke care, summarize their
efficacy, and examine the inclusion of Black and Latinx populations in
the evidence base.MethodsWe searched PubMed, the Web of Science, and
EMBASE for publications between 2015 and 2021. Inclusion criteria
include peer-reviewed systematic reviews or meta-analyses of
experimental studies focusing on the impact of digital health
interventions on stroke risk factors and outcomes in adults. Detailed
information was extracted on intervention modality and functionality,
clinical/behavioral outcome, study location, sample demographics, and
intervention results.ResultsThirty-eight systematic reviews met
inclusion criteria and yielded 519 individual studies. We identified six
functional categories and eight digital health modalities. Case
management (63\%) and health monitoring (50\%) were the most common
intervention functionalities. Mobile apps and web-based interventions
were the two most commonly studied modalities. Evidence of efficacy was
strongest for web-based, text-messaging, and phone-based approaches.
Although mobile applications have been widely studied, the evidence on
efficacy is mixed. Blood pressure and medication adherence were the most
commonly studied outcomes. However, evidence on the efficacy of the
various intervention modalities on these outcomes was variable. Among
all individual studies, only 38.0\% were conducted in the United States
(n = 197). Of these U.S. studies, 54.8\% adequately reported racial or
ethnic group distribution. On average, samples were 27.0\% Black, 17.1\%
Latinx, and 63.4\% White.ConclusionWhile evidence of the efficacy of
selected digital health interventions, particularly those designed to
improve blood pressure management and medication adherence, show
promise, evidence of how these interventions can be generalized to
historically underrepresented groups is insufficient. Including these
underrepresented populations in both digital health experimental and
feasibility studies is critical to advancing digital health science and
achieving health equity.},

 abstract = {Relationship closeness is considered an important psychological variable
for studying couple relationships, and is often postulated as cause for
important relationship outcomes. The current study evaluates four
micro-interventions for their suitability to experimentally elicit
feelings of closeness towards one's partner. Using participants'
smartphones, and a combination of experience sampling, event sampling,
and ecological momentary interventions, individuals reported for a week
on their experiences of closeness before and after completing daily
either a neutral task or a task meant to enhance relationship closeness.
The closeness tasks included showing physical affection, sharing a
childhood memory, looking each other in the eyes for five minutes, and
discussing shared life achievements. Results of intention-to-treat
analyses on a within-person level showed that closeness increased from
pre- to post-measurement on average more strongly on days of any of the
four examined closeness conditions than on days of the neutral control
conditions. Interindividual variability of this effect was observed,
emphasizing the relevance of using within-person designs to evaluate
such interventions. Exploratory analyses showed that effect sizes
declined across time within the day. This study provides instruments for
research on causal effects of closeness in everyday relationship life,
and an evidence basis for smartphone-delivered interventions in
practitioner settings.},

 abstract = {Digital health interventions have shown promise in improving patient
outcomes and experiences in various healthcare settings. However, their
effectiveness in the context of cardiac surgery remains uncertain. This
systematic review aims to evaluate the existing evidence on the use of
digital health interventions for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A
comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Elsevier EMBASE, Elsevier Scopus
databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted to identify relevant
studies published up to the present. Studies that examined the effects
of digital health interventions, including mobile applications and
web-based interventions, on perioperative care and patient outcomes in
cardiac surgery were included. The data were extracted and synthesized
to provide a comprehensive overview of the findings. The search yielded
15 studies composed of 4041 patients, analyzing the feasibility and
implementation of mobile or internet applications for patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. The studies included the use of mobile
applications (ManageMySurgery, SeamlessMD, mHeart, Telediaglog, ExSed,
Soulage Tavie, Heart Health application, and Mayo Clinic Health
Connection) and web-based interventions (Heartnet and Active Heart). The
findings indicated that these digital health interventions were
associated with improved patient engagement, satisfaction, and reduced
healthcare utilization. Patients reported finding the interventions
helpful in their recovery process, and there was evidence of enhanced
symptom monitoring and timely intervention. The completion rates of
modules varied depending on the phase of care, with higher engagement
observed during the acute phase. Interest in using digital health
applications was expressed by patients, regardless of age, gender, or
complexity of the cardiac defect. The results demonstrated that
web-based interventions resulted in improvements in mental health,
quality of life, and eHealth literacy. This systematic review highlights
the potential benefits of digital health interventions in the context of
cardiac surgery. Further research, including randomized controlled
trials, is needed to establish the effectiveness, feasibility, and
generalizability of digital health interventions in cardiac surgery.},

 abstract = {Many interventions for cannabis use disorder (CUD) are associated with
decreases in frequency and quantity of use but fail to increase overall
rates of sustained abstinence. It is currently unknown whether
reductions in use (in the absence of sustained abstinence) result in
clinically significant improvements in functioning. The objective of
this study was to refine a mobile contingency management approach to
reduce cannabis use to ultimately evaluate whether reductions in
frequency and quantity of cannabis are related to improvements in
functional and mental health status. Three cohorts of participants (n =
18 total, n = 10 women) were enrolled and completed 2 weeks of
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) during a baseline ad lib cannabis
use period, followed by a 6 -week reduction period. Participants
completed EMA assessments multiple times per day and were prompted to
provide videotaped saliva cannabis testing 2-3 times daily. Data from
participants who were at least 80\% adherent to all EMA prompts were
analyzed (13 out of 18). During the ad lib phase, participants were
using cannabis on 94\% of the days and reported using a mean of 1.42
grams daily. The intervention was a mobile application that participants
used to record cannabis use by saliva tests to bioverify abstinence and
participants completed electronic diaries to report their grams used.
During the 6 -week intervention phase, participants reported reducing
their use days to 47\% of the days with a reported mean of .61 grams
daily. In the last cohort, at least 50\% of the heavy users were able to
reduce their cannabis use by at least 50\%. The effect of cannabis
reduction (versus abstinence) is largely unknown. Observations suggest
that it is possible to develop a mobile intervention to reduce cannabis
use among heavy users, and this paradigm can be utilized in future work
to evaluate whether reductions in cannabis use among heavy users will
result in improvements in functional and mental health status.},

 abstract = {Background: GET.ON (HelloBetter) treatment interventions have been shown
to be efficacious in multiple randomized controlled trials. Objective:
This study evaluated the effectiveness of 2 GET.ON interventions, GET.ON
Mood Enhancer and GET.ON Stress, in a national digital mental health
service implemented across Germany. Methods: Following an initial web
-based questionnaire, participants were allocated to either intervention
based on their baseline symptom severity and personal choice and
received a semistandardized guided, feedback -on -demand guided, or self
-guided version of the treatment. Uncontrolled routine care data from
851 participants were analyzed using a pretest -posttest design. Half of
the participants (461/851, 54.2\%) were allocated to the stress
intervention (189/461, 41\% semistandardized; 240/461, 52\% feedback on
demand; and 32/461, 6.9\% self -guided), and almost all participants in
the mood intervention (349/352, 99.2\%) received semistandardized
guidance. Results: Results on depression -related symptom severity
indicated a reduction in reported symptoms, with a large effect size of
d=-0.92 (95\% CI -1.21 to -0.63). Results on perceived stress and
insomnia indicated a reduction in symptom severity, with large effect
sizes ofd=1.02 (95\% CI -1.46 to -0.58) and d=-0.75 (95\% CI -1.10 to
-0.40), respectively. A small percentage of participants experienced
deterioration in depression -related symptoms (11/289, 3.8\%), perceived
stress (6/296, 2\%), and insomnia (5/252, 2\%). After completing
treatment, 51.9\% (150/289) of participants showed a clinically reliable
change in depression -related symptoms, whereas 20.4\% (59/289) achieved
a close to symptom -free status. Similar improvements were observed in
perceived stress and insomnia severity. Guidance moderated the
effectiveness of and adherence to the interventions in reducing
depressive symptom severity. Effect sizes on depression -related symptom
severity were d=-1.20 (95\% CI -1.45 to -0.93) for the semistandardized
group, d=-0.36 (95\% CI -0.68 to -0.04) for the feedback -on -demand
group, and d=-0.83 (95\% CI -1.03 to -0.63) for the self -guided group.
Furthermore, 47.6\% (405/851) of the participants completed all modules
of the intervention. Participant satisfaction was high across all
patient groups and both interventions; 89.3\% (242/271) of participants
would recommend it to a friend in need of similar help. Limitations
include the assignment to treatments and guidance formats based on
symptom severity. Furthermore, part of the differences in symptom change
between groups must be assumed to be due to this baseline difference in
the measures. Conclusions: Future digital health implementation and
routine care research should focus on monitoring symptom deterioration
and other negative effects, as well as possible predictors of
deterioration and the investigation of individual patient trajectories.
In conclusion, this study supports the effectiveness of tailored digital
mental health services in routine care for depressionand stress -related
symptoms in Germany. The results highlight the importance of guidance in
delivering internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy interventions and
provide further evidence for its potential delivered as web -only
solutions for increasing access to and use of psychological treatments.

@article{WOS:001167472700004,
 abstract = {Background: There is a growing interest in developing scalable
interventions, including internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy
(iCBT), to meet the increasing demand for mental health services. Given
the growth in diversity worldwide, it is essential that the clinical
trials of iCBT for depression include diverse samples or, at least,
report information on the race, ethnicity, or other background
indicators of their samples. Unfortunately, the field lacks data on how
well diversity is currently reported and represented in the iCBT
literature. Objective: Thus, the main objective of this systematic
review was to examine the overall reporting of racial and ethnic
identities in published clinical trials of iCBT for depression. We also
aimed to review the representation of specific racial and ethnic
minoritized groups and the inclusion of alternative background
indicators such as migration status or country of residence. Methods:
Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials in which
iCBT was compared to a waiting list, care-as-usual, active control, or
another iCBT. The included papers also had to have a focus on acute
treatment (eg, 4 weeks to 6 months) of depression, be delivered via the
internet on a website or a smartphone app and use guided or unguided
self-help. Studies were initially identified from the METAPSY database
(n=59) and then extended to include papers up to 2022, with papers
retrieved from Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane (n=3). Risk of
bias assessment suggested that reported studies had at least some risk
of bias due to use of self-report outcome measures. Results: A total of
62 iCBT randomized controlled trials representing 17,210 participants
are summarized in this study. Out of those 62 papers, only 17 (27\%) of
the trials reported race, and only 12 (19\%) reported ethnicity.
Reporting outside of the United States was very poor, with the United
States accounting for 15 (88\%) out of 17 of studies that reported race
and 9 (75\%) out of 12 for ethnicity. Out of 3,623 participants whose
race was reported in the systematic review, the racial category reported
the most was White (n=2716, 74.9\%), followed by Asian (n=209, 5.8\%)
and Black (n=274, 7.6\%). Furthermore, only 25 (54\%) out of the 46
papers conducted outside of the United States reported other background
demographics. Conclusions: It is important to note that the
underreporting observed in this study does not necessarily indicate an
underrepresentation in the actual study population. However, these
findings highlight the poor reporting of race and ethnicity in iCBT
trials for depression found in the literature. This lack of diversity
reporting may have significant implications for the scalability of these
interventions.},

@article{WOS:001170698300001,
 abstract = {Objective: Technology-based programs can be cost-effective in the
management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However,
cost-effectiveness estimates always contain some uncertainty, and
decisions based upon them carry some risk. We conducted a value of
information (VOI) analysis to estimate the value of additional research
of a web-based self-management intervention for COPD to reduce the costs
associated with uncertainty.
Methods: We used a 10,000-iteration cost-effectiveness model from the
health care payer perspective to calculate the expected value of perfect
information (EVPI) at the patient- and population-level. An opportunity
loss was incurred when the web-based intervention did not produce a
greater net monetary benefit than usual care in an iteration. We
calculated the probability of opportunity loss and magnitude of
opportunity costs as a function of baseline health utility. We
aggregated opportunity costs over the projected incident population of
inpatient COPD patients over 10 years and estimated it as a function of
the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Costs are in 2022 U.S. Dollars.
Results: Opportunity losses were found in 22.7\% of the iterations. The
EVPIpatient was \$78 per patient (95\% confidence interval: \$75-\$82).
The probability that the intervention was the optimal strategy varied
across baseline health utilities. The EVPIpopulation was \$506,666,882
over 10 years for a WTP of \$50,000.
Conclusions: Research estimated to cost up to \$500 million would be
warranted to reduce uncertainty. Future research could focus on
identifying the impact of baseline health utilities to maximize the cost
savings of the intervention. Other considerations for future research
priorities include implementation efforts for technology-based
interventions.},

 abstract = {Background Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) exposes women to future
risk of Type 2 Diabetes. Previous studies focused on diet and physical
activity, less emphasis was given to tackle intertwined risk factors
such as sleep and stress. Knowledge remains scarce in multi-ethnic Asian
communities. This study explored the: (1) feasibility of a holistic
digital intervention on improving diet, physical activity (PA), sleep
and stress of Asian women with a history of GDM, and (2) preliminary
efficacy of the holistic intervention on women's physical and mental
well-being via a pilot randomized controlled trial.Methods Female
volunteers with a history of GDM but without pre-existing diabetes were
recruited from multi-ethnic Singaporean community. Each eligible woman
was given a self-monitoring opportunity using Oura Ring that provided
daily feedback on step counts, PA, sleep and bedtime heart rate.
Intervention group additionally received personalized recommendations
aimed to reinforce healthy behaviors holistically (diet, PA, sleep and
stress). Dietary intake was evaluated by a research dietitian, while
step counts, PA, sleep and bedtime heart rate were evaluated by health
coaches based on Oura Ring data. Perceived physical and mental health
and well-being were self-reported. Clinical outcomes included glycemic
status determined by HbA1c and OGTT tests, body mass index, blood
pressures and lipid profile.Results Of 196 women from the community, 72
women completed diabetes screening, 61 women were eligible and 56 women
completed the study. The 56 completers had mean age of 35.8 +/- 3.7
years, predominantly Chinese, majority had their first GDM diagnosed at
least 2 years ago and had two GDM-affected pregnancies. After
intervention period, more women in the Intervention group achieved at
least 8,000 steps/day and had at least 6 hours of sleep per night.
Noticeable reduction of added sugar in their food and beverages were
observed after the dietary intervention. Changes in body weight and
mental well-being were observed but group differences were not
statistically significant.Conclusions The holistic approach appeared
feasible for personalizing lifestyle recommendations to promote physical
and mental well-being among women with a history of GDM. Larger studies
with sufficient assessment timepoints and follow-up duration are
warranted to improve the evaluation of intervention effects on clinical
outcomes.Clinical trial registration number

 abstract = {Objective: We investigated the presence of latent transition profiles in
a sample of users of a cognitive -behavioral mental health app for the
general population. Users' baseline characteristics were used as
predictors of the profiles. The role of engagement with the app in the
transition profiles was examined. Method: A total of 541 users completed
the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 and the General Anxiety Disorder -7
when started using the app and 30 days after. Random -Intercept Latent
Transition Analysis was implemented to identify users' profiles and
transition patterns as classes. The age of the users and the Emotional
Self -Awareness Scale -Revised (ESAS-R) were used as predictors of class
membership at baseline. The Homework Rating Scale -Mobile Application
(HRSMA; as a measure of engagement) was used as a predictor of class
membership at 30 days of app use. Results: A 3 class solution was
obtained according to the severity of symptoms (from mild to moderately
severe). Age and ESAS-R predicted class membership initially; the higher
the age and ESAS-R, the higher the probability of starting using the app
with lower distress levels. The HRS-MA predicted class membership at 30
days of app use; the higher the engagement for more symptomatic and
younger users, the higher the probability of improvement. However, older
users tended to engage less. Conclusion: Our findings underpin the
relevance of easily accessible digital interventions for young adults
with mild to moderate mental health problems. Further studies and
developments are required to enhance these apps for older cohorts.},

 abstract = {BackgroundFor patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors, early
detection of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) is critical for one's
safety. To this end, a smartphone app (SOFIA) was developed that
featured the assessment of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs)
focusing on irAEs as well as a set of comprehensive supportive
information. Its feasibility and preliminary efficacy were evaluated in
a randomized controlled trial (RCT).MethodsPatients who received immune
checkpoint inhibition therapy were randomly assigned to an intervention
group (IG) or a control group (CG; care as usual). During the 12-week
intervention period, IG patients used SOFIA to report twice weekly ePROs
and receive cancer- and immunotherapy-relevant contents. Before a
patient's next clinical visit, the physician in charge was given the
ePRO reports. The primary objective was to test the feasibility of
SOFIA. Furthermore, the preliminary efficacy of SOFIA for health-related
quality of life (HRQOL), psychosocial outcomes, and medical data was
examined. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0),
post-intervention (T1), and a 3-month follow-up (T2).ResultsSeventy-one
patients were randomized to the IG (n = 34) or the CG (n = 37). SOFIA
showed high feasibility and acceptance. At T1, patients in the IG
reported significantly better HRQOL and role functioning and less
depression, distress, and appetite loss. No significant differences were
revealed regarding medical data, the utilization of supportive care
services, or survival.ConclusionsSOFIA showed high feasibility and
acceptance and improved HRQOL and psychosocial outcomes. These results
suggest further evaluation of efficacy in a large-scale confirmatory
multicenter RCT.
An ehealth intervention (SOFIA) for patients with cancer undergoing
immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors showed high feasibility
and acceptance in the clinical routine. Results regarding preliminary
efficacy revealed better health-related quality of life and reduced
psychosocial symptoms in the intervention group compared to the control
group, which indicates the positive effects of SOFIA, and should be
investigated in a confirmatory randomized controlled trial.},

 abstract = {Using an exploratory mobile app intervention, we investigated the
effectiveness of messages focusing on environmental awareness and/or
environmental skills to promote sustainable seafood choices. In this
study, 348 volunteers participated in a 10-week intervention. Depending
on the experimental condition, participants read messages for 36 days:
a) environmental awareness messages (i.e., information about the
environmental impact of seafood production); b) environmental skills
messages (i.e., information focusing on how to recognise and prepare
sustainable seafood); c) combined messages (i.e., information that
combined the previous two messages); d) no messages. We compared the
effects of the conditions on attitudes towards purchasing sustainable
seafood, perceived behavioural control over purchasing sustainable
seafood, seafood choice, and self-reported purchase. After the
intervention, participants who received the environmental awareness
messages reported more positive attitudes and higher perceived
behavioural control. These improvements remained stable during the
follow-up period (1 month after the end of the intervention). The
environmental skills messages led to an increase in positive attitudes,
perceived behavioural control, and purchasing behaviour, although the
purchase of sustainable seafood started to decrease at follow-up. The
combined messages improved attitudes and perceived behavioural control.
In addition, participants in this condition purchased more sustainable
seafood at follow-up. These results contribute to our understanding of
how messages can be designed to promote sustainable seafood choices.},

 abstract = {Using the Framework for Information Literacy published by the
Association of College \& Research Libraries, we developed an online
intervention to increase information literacy. Specifically, we
hypothesized that undergraduate students in an information literacy
intervention group would increase in information literacy performance
and confidence compared to a control group which did not receive
asynchronous online information literacy instruction. We used a
non-equivalent groups pretest-posttest design and measured students' (N
= 101) information literacy performance and self-reported confidence
before and after asynchronous information literacy instruction. We
compared the intervention with a non-intervention control condition
using two existing undergraduate psychology courses offered online
across two semesters. Partially confirming our hypotheses, we found that
providing asynchronous information literacy instruction not only
increased students' information literacy performance but also helped
students to evaluate their own information literacy skills more
accurately. In contrast, our intervention did not selectively increase
confidence in information literacy as both information literacy
intervention and control groups similarly increased in information
literacy confidence over time. Nevertheless, these findings show that we
managed to develop an online, theory-based intervention to increase
information literacy. This intervention has the potential to build the
foundations for students to engage in scientific conversations by
elevating their understanding of how scientific information is produced
and how science affects their daily lives.},

 abstract = {Objective: Smart sensing has the potential to make psychotherapeutic
treatments more effective. It involves the passive analysis and
collection of data generated by digital devices. However, acceptance of
smart sensing among psychotherapy patients remains unclear. Based on the
unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), this study
investigated (1) the acceptance toward smart sensing in a sample of
psychotherapy patients (2) the effectiveness of an acceptance
facilitating intervention (AFI) and (3) the determinants of acceptance.
Methods: Patients (N = 116) were randomly assigned to a control group
(CG) or intervention group (IG). The IG received a video AFI on smart
sensing, and the CG a control video. An online questionnaire was used to
assess acceptance of smart sensing, performance expectancy, effort
expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence. The
intervention effects of the AFI on acceptance were investigated. The
determinants of acceptance were analyzed with structural equation
modeling (SEM). Results: The IG showed a moderate level of acceptance (M
= 3.16, SD = 0.97), while the CG showed a low level (M = 2.76, SD =
1.0). The increase in acceptance showed a moderate effect in the
intervention group (p < .05, d = 0.4). For the IG, performance
expectancy (M = 3.92, SD = 0.7), effort expectancy (M = 3.90, SD = 0.98)
as well as facilitating conditions (M = 3.91, SD = 0.93) achieved high
levels. Performance expectancy (gamma = 0.63, p < .001) and effort
expectancy (gamma = 0.36, p < .001) were identified as the core
determinants of acceptance explaining 71.1\% of its variance. The fit
indices supported the model's validity (CFI = .95, TLI = .93, RMSEA =
.08). Discussion: The low acceptance in the CG suggests that enhancing
the acceptance should be considered, potentially increasing the use and
adherence to the technology. The current AFI was effective in doing so
and is thus a promising approach. The IG also showed significantly
higher performance expectancy and social influence and, in general, a
strong expression of the UTAUT factors. The results support the
applicability of the UTAUT in the context of smart sensing in a clinical
sample, as the included predictors were able to explain a great amount
of the variance of acceptance.},

@article{WOS:001219469600042,
 abstract = {Background Rates of prediabetes, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, are
increasing worldwide. Interventions for prediabetes mainly focus on
lifestyle changes to diet and exercise. While these interventions are
effective, they are often delivered face-to-face, which may pose a
barrier to those with limited access to healthcare. Given the evidence
for digital interventions addressing other noncommunicable diseases,
these may also be effective for prediabetes self-management. The aim of
this scoping review was to assess the breadth of evidence around digital
interventions for prediabetes self-management.Methods We developed a
targeted search strategy and relevant studies were identified through
searches conducted in four bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase,
PsycInfo, and Scopus). Published studies were eligible if they included
a digital intervention to support adults aged 18+ with prediabetes
self-management. Titles and abstracts were first screened for relevance
by one researcher. Full texts of selected records were assessed against
the review criteria independently by two researchers for inclusion in
the final analysis.Results Twenty-nine studies were included, of which
nine were randomised controlled trials. Most efficacy studies reported
significant changes in at least one primary and/or secondary outcome,
including participants' glycaemic control, weight loss and/or physical
activity levels. About one-third of studies reported mixed outcomes or
early significant outcomes that were not sustained at long-term
follow-up. Interventions varied in length, digital modalities, and
complexity. Delivery formats included text messages, mobile apps,
virtually accessible dietitians/health coaches, online peer groups, and
web-based platforms. Approximately half of studies assessed participant
engagement/acceptability outcomes.Conclusion Whilst the evidence here
suggests that digital interventions to support prediabetes
self-management are acceptable and have the potential to reduce one's
risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, more research is needed to
understand which interventions, and which components specifically, have
the greatest reach to diverse populations, are most effective at
promoting user engagement, and are most effective in the longer term.},

 abstract = {Background: Workplace mental health is an important global health
concern. Objectives: This unblinded, phase -III, wait -listed cluster
randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of a
mobile health (mHealth) psychoeducation program using a spaced education
approach on mental health literacy (MHL) in the workplace. The main
interest of this paper was the immediate and 3 -month medium -term
effect of the program on the MHL of workers. The purposely built mHealth
platform was also evaluated as a health -related app. Methods: The
mHealth platform was designed using the principle of spaced education as
a psychoeducation intervention program, with various modules of web
-based and mobile materials presented to the participant in a
progressive manner. Short quizzes at the end of each module ensured
adequate learning, and successful completion qualified the learner to
progress to the next level. The trial recruited 456 employees of
specific industries with high levels of work -related stress.
Participants who were nested in different offices or units were
allocated into the intervention and wait -listed control groups using a
block randomization process, with the office or unit as the cluster. A
separate sample of 70 individual raters were used for the evaluation of
the mHealth platform. The Australian National MHL and Stigma Survey and
the Mobile Apps Rating Scale were completed through a web -based self
-reported survey to assess MHL and evaluate the app. The trial and
follow-up data were analyzed by a generalized linear latent and mixed
model with adjustments for the clustering effect of work sites and
repeated measures. Results: Of the 456 participants in the trial, 236
(51.8\%) responded to the follow-up survey. Most MHL outcomes obtained
significant results immediately after the intervention and across time.
After adjusting for the clustering effect, the postintervention weighted
mean scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than the
control group for correct recognition of a mental health problem, help
seeking, and stigmatization by 0.2 (SE 0.1; P =.003), 0.9 (SE 0.2; P
<.001), and 1.8 (SE 0.4; P <.001), respectively. After adjusting for the
clustering effect, significant differences across time were found in
help -seeking intention ( P =.01), stigmatization ( P <.001), and social
distancing ( P <.001). The evaluation of the mHealth program resulted in
average scores of the 4 major domains ranging from 3.8 to 4.2, with
engagement having the lowest score. Conclusions: The mHealth
psychoeducation intervention program using this platform had immediate
and 3 -month mediumterm effects of retaining and improving MHL. The
platform was evaluated to have satisfactory performance in terms of
functionality, aesthetics, information content, and utility in enhancing
MHL. It is anticipated that ongoing development in digital health will
provide great benefits in improving the mental health of the global
population.},

 abstract = {Background/Aims Physical activity (PA) is effective for managing
symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but people with RA are less active
than their healthy counterparts. A digital intervention (DI) to promote
PA, is a potential solution. There is a paucity of literature available
exploring the requirements of people with RA for a digital intervention.
It is important to explore experiences and preferences before developing
such an intervention. Aims: 1. Identify digital technology currently
used by people with RA to support PA. 2. Understand the preferences and
acceptability of people with RA for potential DI delivery. Methods A
survey was developed to address these aims. A patient research partner
(CS) and `think aloud' pilots contributed to development. The survey was
circulated once to members of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society
in November 2022. This study was approved by the National Health Service
Research Ethics Committee (reference 22/NE/0158). Results 1178 people
consented to take part (86\% female, 64\% aged 55-74). The majority used
digital technology every day (97\%). 84\% anticipated using a potential
DI to support PA, most preferably every day (48\%) or 2-3 times a week
(14\%). 16\% never anticipated using DI to support PA. 34\% reported
currently using technology to support PA; mostly an app without
healthcare professional (HCP) interaction (42\%) or internet videos
(40\%). A further 27\% had tried technology to support PA but
discontinued, and 39\% had never tried. An app was the most preferable
delivery platform (56\%), followed by a website (43\%) or internet
videos (28\%). 51\% would prefer to be offered or signposted to digital
technology to support PA by an exercise professional with specific
rheumatology training or a healthcare professional (22\%). Potential DI
delivery methods were rated on a Likert scale of 1-5 for general
acceptability, a score of five indicating highest acceptability:
automated response mean{[}SD] 3.6{[}0.9], ad-hoc HCP interaction
3.5{[}0.8] pre-arranged HCP interaction 3.4{[}1] and no interaction
3.1{[}1]. Conclusion People with RA are using digital technology
regularly and many anticipated using a DI to support PA. Despite this,
only a third are currently using digital technology to support PA. An
app or website platform was the preferred delivery method suggesting
that an internet delivered intervention is acceptable. Acceptability
ratings of DI delivery methods were similar. Further sub-group analysis
and exploration of free text responses is planned to inform tailoring of
DI delivery. Disclosure C. Gerlis: None. A. Berry: None. S. Halls: None.

 abstract = {Introduction: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related
deaths globally. Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed
tomography (LDCT) can reduce lung cancer mortality, but its adoption in
the U.S. has been limited. Digital interventions have the potential to
improve uptake of LCS. This systematic review aims to summarize the
evidence for the effectiveness of digital interventions in promoting
LCS. Methods: A systematic search of three electronic databases (PubMed,
Embase, and Medline) was conducted to identify studies published between
January 2014 and May 2023. Studies were reviewed and abstracted between
February 2023 and July 2023. Outcomes related to knowledge,
decisionmaking and screening were measured. Study quality was assessed
using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools.
Results: Of 1,979 screened articles, 30 studies were included in this
review. Digital interventions evaluated included decision aids (n=20),
electronic health record (EHR)-based interventions (n=7), social media
campaigns and mobile applications (n=3). Decision aids were the most
commonly studied digital interventions, with most studies showing
improved knowledge (13/13) and reduced decisional con fl ict (7/9) but
most did not show a substantial change in screening use. Fewer studies
tested clinician-facing or multi-level interventions. Discussion:
Digital interventions, particularly decision aids, have shown promise in
improving knowledge and the quality of decision-making around LCS.
However, few interventions have been shown to substantially alter
screening behavior and few clinician-facing or multi-level interventions
have been rigorously tested. Further research is needed to develop
effective tools for engaging patients in LCS, to compare the ef fi cacy
of different interventions, and evaluate implementation strategies in
diverse healthcare settings.},

 abstract = {Prior research suggests that repetitive negative thinking (RNT)
negatively impacts mental health by intensifying and prolonging
emotional reactivity to stress. This study investigated whether an
intervention designed to reduce RNT alters emotional reactivity. Young
adults with high trait RNT (N = 79) were randomly allocated to an
RNT-focused intervention (smartphone app-based, 10 days) or a waiting
list before exposure to a standardized stressor. The pre-registered
analysis did not reveal a significant condition {*} time interaction for
negative affect. However, exploratory analyses showed that whilst
initial increases in negative affect in response to the stressor did not
differ between conditions, participants in the intervention condition
reported less negative affect throughout the following recovery phase.
Additionally, participants in the intervention condition appraised their
ability to cope with the stressor as higher and reported less RNT in the
recovery phase. In contrast, the intervention did not affect biological
stress responses. The findings indicate that RNT-focused interventions
might have positive effects on mental health by breaking the
self-reinforcing cycle of RNT, negative affect and maladaptive
appraisals in response to stress. However, as findings are partly based
on exploratory analyses, further research is needed to confirm whether
reduced subjective stress reactivity mediates the effects of RNT-focused
interventions on psychopathological symptoms.},

 abstract = {Remote patient monitoring has recently been popularised due to advanced
technological innovations. The advent of the Sixth Generation Internet
of Things (6G-IoT) communication technology, combined with deep learning
algorithms, presents a groundbreaking opportunity for enhancing remote
cardiac system monitoring. This paper proposes an innovative framework
leveraging the ultra-reliable, low-latency communication capabilities of
6G-IoT to transmit real-time cardiac data from wearable devices directly
to healthcare providers. Integrating deep learning models facilitates
the accurate analysis and prediction of cardiac anomalies, significantly
improving traditional monitoring systems. Our methodology involves the
deployment of cutting-edge wearable sensors capable of capturing
high-fidelity cardiac signals. These signals are transmitted via 6G-IoT
networks, ensuring minimal delay and maximum reliability. Upon receiving
the data, a densely connected deep neural network with an optimised
swish activation function-designed explicitly for cardiac anomaly
detection is employed to analyse the data in real-time. These algorithms
are trained on vast datasets to recognise patterns indicative of
potential cardiac issues, allowing immediate intervention when
necessary. The proposed system's efficacy is validated through extensive
testing in simulated environments, demonstrating its ability to
accurately detect and swiftly predict a wide range of cardiac
conditions. Moreover, implementing 6G-IoT communication ensures the
system's scalability and adaptability to future technological
advancements.},
