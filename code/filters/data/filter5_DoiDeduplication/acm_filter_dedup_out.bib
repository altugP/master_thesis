 abstract = {Wearable wireless sensors for health monitoring are enabling the design and delivery of just-in-time interventions (JITI). Critical to the success of JITI is to time its delivery so that the user is available to be engaged. We take a first step in modeling users' availability by analyzing 2,064 hours of physiological sensor data and 2,717 self-reports collected from 30 participants in a week-long field study. We use delay in responding to a prompt to objectively measure availability. We compute 99 features and identify 30 as most discriminating to train a machine learning model for predicting availability. We find that location, affect, activity type, stress, time, and day of the week, play significant roles in predicting availability. We find that users are least available at work and during driving, and most available when walking outside. Our model finally achieves an accuracy of 74.7% in 10-fold cross-validation and 77.9% with leave-one-subject-out.},

 abstract = {Management of daily stress can be greatly improved by delivering sensor-triggered just-in-time interventions (JITIs) on mobile devices. The success of such JITIs critically depends on being able to mine the time series of noisy sensor data to find the most opportune moments. In this paper, we propose a time series pattern mining method to detect significant stress episodes in a time series of discontinuous and rapidly varying stress data. We apply our model to 4 weeks of physiological, GPS, and activity data collected from 38 users in their natural environment to discover patterns of stress in real life. We find that the duration of a prior stress episode predicts the duration of the next stress episode and stress in mornings and evenings is lower than during the day. We then analyze the relationship between stress and objectively rated disorder in the surrounding neighborhood and develop a model to predict stressful episodes.},

@article{10.1145/3287031,
 abstract = {Behavioral medicine is devoting increasing attention to the topic of participant engagement and its role in effective mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions. Several definitions of the term "engagement" have been proposed and discussed, especially in the context of digital health behavioral interventions. We consider that engagement refers to specific interaction and use patterns with the mHealth tools such as smartphone applications for intervention, whereas adherence refers to compliance with the directives of the health intervention, independent of the mHealth tools. Through our analysis of participant interaction and self-reported behavioral data in a college student health study with incentives, we demonstrate an example of measuring "effective engagement" as engagement behaviors that can be linked to the goals of the desired intervention. We demonstrate how clustering of one year of weekly health behavior self-reports generate four interpretable clusters related to participants' adherence to the desired health behaviors: healthy and steady, unhealthy and steady, decliners, and improvers. Based on the intervention goals of this study (health promotion and behavioral change), we show that not all app usage metrics are indicative of the desired outcomes that create effective engagement. As such, mHealth intervention design might consider eliciting not just more engagement or use overall, but rather, effective engagement defined by use patterns related to the desired behavioral outcome.},

 abstract = {Recent advancements in sensing techniques for mHealth applications have led to successful development and deployments of several mHealth intervention designs, including Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI). JITAIs show great potential because they aim to provide the right type and amount of support, at the right time. Timing the delivery of a JITAI such as the user is receptive and available to engage with the intervention is crucial for a JITAI to succeed. Although previous research has extensively explored the role of context in users' responsiveness towards generic phone notifications, it has not been thoroughly explored for actual mHealth interventions. In this work, we explore the factors affecting users' receptivity towards JITAIs. To this end, we conducted a study with 189 participants, over a period of 6 weeks, where participants received interventions to improve their physical activity levels. The interventions were delivered by a chatbot-based digital coach -Ally - which was available on Android and iOS platforms.We define several metrics to gauge receptivity towards the interventions, and found that (1) several participant-specific characteristics (age, personality, and device type) show significant associations with the overall participant receptivity over the course of the study, and that (2) several contextual factors (day/time, phone battery, phone interaction, physical activity, and location), show significant associations with the participant receptivity, in-the-moment. Further, we explore the relationship between the effectiveness of the intervention and receptivity towards those interventions; based on our analyses, we speculate that being receptive to interventions helped participants achieve physical activity goals, which in turn motivated participants to be more receptive to future interventions. Finally, we build machine-learning models to detect receptivity, with up to a 77% increase in F1 score over a biased random classifier.},

 abstract = {Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) is an emerging technique with great potential to support health behavior by providing the right type and amount of support at the right time. A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions.We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.},

 abstract = {Mental health symptoms are commonly discovered in primary care. Yet, these settings are not set up to provide psychological treatment. Digital interventions can play a crucial role in stepped care management of patients’ symptoms where patients are offered a low intensity intervention, and treatment evolves to incorporate providers if needed. Though digital interventions often use smartphone and wearable sensor data, little is known about patients’ desires to use these data to manage mental health symptoms. In 10 interviews with patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety, we explored their: symptom self-management, current and desired use of sensor data, and comfort sharing such data with providers. Findings support the use digital interventions to manage mental health, yet they also highlight a misalignment in patient needs and current efforts to use sensors. We outline considerations for future research, including extending design thinking to wraparound services that may be necessary to truly reduce healthcare burden.},
