abstract = {Wearable wireless sensors for health monitoring are enabling the design and delivery of just-in-time interventions (JITI). Critical to the success of JITI is to time its delivery so that the user is available to be engaged. We take a first step in modeling users' availability by analyzing 2,064 hours of physiological sensor data and 2,717 self-reports collected from 30 participants in a week-long field study. We use delay in responding to a prompt to objectively measure availability. We compute 99 features and identify 30 as most discriminating to train a machine learning model for predicting availability. We find that location, affect, activity type, stress, time, and day of the week, play significant roles in predicting availability. We find that users are least available at work and during driving, and most available when walking outside. Our model finally achieves an accuracy of 74.7% in 10-fold cross-validation and 77.9% with leave-one-subject-out.},

abstract = {Mobile health (mHealth) behavioural interventions have increasingly recognised the importance of integrating evidence supported behaviour change techniques and user centred design feedback. This paper presents a mHealth intervention design process that systematically integrates these criteria in the context of designing a novel app to modify snacking behaviour. The design process builds upon previous work with stages to facilitate "conceptualisation", "formative research and pretesting activities", "pilot trials" and "evaluation trials". In "conceptualisation", we use the validated Behaviour Change Wheel framework as a means to illustrate how an innovative mHealth snacking app can be achieved through the use of evidence-based behaviour change techniques (cue monitoring and implementation intentions). We then illustrate how the Health IT Usability Evaluation Model framework can support user centred design in "formative research and pretesting activities", "pilot trials" and "evaluation trials".},

abstract = {Remote patient monitoring is becoming increasingly instrumental to healthcare delivery but can substantially hamper the interpersonal communication that underlies standard clinical practice. In this work, we explore the benefits imparted to patients, clinicians, and researchers by an asynchronous messaging feature within a platform called COVIDFree@Home. We created COVIDFree@Home to assist the healthcare system in a large metropolitan city in North America during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians used COVIDFree@Home to monitor the self-reported symptoms and vital signs of over 350 COVID-19 patients post-infection. Using thematic analysis of user-initiated messages, we found the messaging feature helped maintain protocol adherence while allowing patients to ask questions about their health and clinicians to convey empathetic care. This feedback cycle also led to higher quality data for hospitalization prediction, as the revisions significantly improved the AUROC of a machine learning model trained on demographic variables, vital signs data, and self-reported symptoms from 0.53 to 0.59.},

abstract = {Diabetes, characterized as a persistent metabolic condition, requires efficient self-management approaches to achieve optimal health results. Mobile applications have emerged as auspicious instruments for facilitating diabetes self-care. This research seeks to enhance the development of Diabetes Self-Management Apps through the incorporation of user-centric methodologies. Employing Semi-Structured Interviews (SSI) involving both end users and healthcare professionals, the study aims to discern user requirements and formulate a novel model centered around user preferences. Qualitative data analysis methods are employed to extract themes from the SSI data, aligning with participant values. The results yield valuable insights for crafting user-friendly self-management applications tailored to the evolving landscape of diabetes care. Noteworthy themes extracted from the SSI data underscore the significance of personalized approaches to diabetes self-care, integration of tailored feedback, social support, positive reinforcement, and the promotion of positive emotions. By addressing user-identified aspects, this research propels advancements in diabetic management models, ensuring they better cater to user expectations and requirements. The study makes a substantial contribution to the domain of diabetes self-management by prioritizing user-centric design and offering insights to amplify the effectiveness and user appeal of self-management applications.},

The evaluation was conducted by measuring participant CPR competence using the "gold standard" of CPR training [10], namely frequency and compression depth. The evaluation demonstrated that the Smart Watch feedback system provided a significant improvement in the participant performance.

abstract = {Despite the potential of mobile health (mHealth) apps to provide patients with an effective means to self-manage asthma, to date, little is known about the key design features and health outcomes brought by such apps. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review and examine the research evidence on health outcomes of mHealth apps that support patient self-management of asthma and the key design features to achieve these outcomes. Four databases were searched using the keywords against the eligibility criteria, yielding 446 studies with ten finally included. The thematic analysis identified five key features of the mHealth app – communication, assessment, planning, education and reminder – abbreviated as a CAPER model. Of the nine studies that measured asthma control, eight showed significant positive changes and one remained unchanged. Seven studies measured asthma-related quality of life, seeing three positive changes, three without change, and one only with positive changes in physical measurements but not in mental measurements. Three studies measured asthma medication use with two positive changes and one unchanged. Lung function was measured in two studies while exacerbation, asthma symptoms, asthma education and self-efficacy were measured in only one study and significant positive outcomes only be seen in asthma symptoms and education; the other three remained unchanged. It appears that most mHealth apps for self-management of asthma can improve asthma control, asthma-related quality of life and medication use. Further research is needed to gather sound evidence about the relationship between the key design features and patient outcomes.},

abstract = {Despite the substantial number of existing publications on conceptual modelling education and feedback, in particular, the perfect balance between the effectiveness of feedback and the costs of the feedback design tailored to the field-specific needs of conceptual modelling remains an unanswered scientific and pedagogical question. The existing educational literature and online courses on conceptual modelling tend to overlook the essential aspects of metacognition and self-regulation in the learning process. The problem of providing feedback is exacerbated by the time-consuming nature of manual feedback provision and the difficulties of automating the provision of personalized and elaborated feedback. This paper presents an experience report on designing and implementing a learning ontology-based personalized feedback report aimed at raising student self-awareness and self-regulated learning in a university level conceptual modelling course, while the design aims at automation of the feedback provisioning in the near future. It describes the stages of learning report development and provides directions for adapting this type of feedback for various learning settings in conceptual modelling education, in view of potential future automation of report provision.},

In our approach we pay particular regard to lifestyle changes.Research approach -- The conceptual framework for self-management systems will be constructed based on key literature and interviews with care professionals. The Situated Cognitive Engineering framework will guide the development of a prototype self-management system aimed at lifestyle changes and the formulation of guidelines for personalization and contextualization. Last, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be used to examine (1) the influence of human factors on personalization and contextualization and (2) the impact of personalization and contextualization on the self-management skills of patients.Findings -- We have thus far developed a conceptual framework for self-management systems.Take away message -- The development of a conceptual framework and the understanding of the influence of human factors and design principles on patients' lifestyle management will be of great benefit to the development and improvement of self-management systems.},

abstract = {In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and portable health guides to devise users. Current online decision-making methods for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However, data for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online learning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides, we find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and connected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic RL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method in all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective policies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm start trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization of our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised learning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related tasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that in a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.},

As mobile health (mHealth) interventions gain traction as methods for addressing these disparities, they continue to lack relevance to Native American youth. In an effort to explore the design of relevant behavioral mHealth intervention for Native American communities, we have developed ARORA (Amplifying Resilience Over Restricted Internet Access), a prototype behavioral mHealth intervention that has been co-designed with Native American youth, a community advisory board, and a clinical psychologist. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze our co-design and focus group sessions using a grounded theory approach and identify the key themes that Native American community members have identified as being critical components of relevant mHealth designs. Notably, we find that the Native American youth who participated in our focus groups desired a greater level of didactic interaction with cultural and behavioral health elements. We conclude with a discussion of the significant challenges we faced in our efforts to co-design software with Native American stakeholders and provide recommendations that might guide other HCI researchers and designers through challenges that arise during the process of cross-cultural design.},

Thus, parental caregivers are expected to be heavily involved in their child’s everyday illness management. Our study aims to investigate how children and parents collaborate to manage T1D and examine how the children become more independent in their self-management through the support of their parents. Through semi-structured interviews with children with T1D and their parents (N=41), our study showed that children’s knowledge of illness management and motivation for self-care were crucial for their transition towards independence. Based on these two factors, we identified four types of children’s collaboration (i.e., dependent, resistant, eager, and independent) and parents’ strategies for supporting their children’s independence. We suggest design implications for technologies to support collaborative care by improving children’s transition to independent illness management.},

abstract = {Behavioural data analytics and user log analysis can be useful to gain insight into how users interact with technologies. In this study, data analytics were conducted on maternal mental health data generated from the Moment Health app to address the question: What is the temporal behaviour of users when completing ecological momentary assessments (EMA) on a mental health app, with EMAs in the form of full mental health scales versus EMAs in the form of mood logs? The Health Interaction Log Data Analytics (HILDA) pipeline was used to analyse 1,461 users of the app. More users completed single mood logs EMAs (n=6,993) compared to scaled EMAs (n=2,129). Distinct temporal patterns were identified, with more users willing to log moods at 9am and 12pm as opposed to completing a scale. The most common hours for users to complete scaled EMAs are between 8pm and 10pm. The least number of mood logs and scale completions take place on Saturday. Whilst happiness is the dominant mood during day times, anxiety and sadness peak during the night at 1am and 4am respectively. The data indicates that postnatal depression decreases over time for some users (r = -0.23, p-value &lt; 0.01). The overall finding from this work are that users prefer simple EMA approaches and that the temporal behavior of users engaging with the two forms of EMA are distinctly different.},

abstract = {According to prior work, the type of relationship between a person consuming alcohol and others in the surrounding (friends, family, spouse, etc.), and the number of those people (alone, with one person, with a group) are related to many aspects of alcohol consumption, such as the drinking amount, location, motives, and mood. Even though the social context is recognized as an important aspect that influences the drinking behavior of young adults in alcohol research, relatively little work has been conducted in smartphone sensing research on this topic. In this study, we analyze the weekend nightlife drinking behavior of 241 young adults in a European country, using a dataset consisting of self-reports and passive smartphone sensing data over a period of three months. Using multiple statistical analyses, we show that features from modalities such as accelerometer, location, application usage, bluetooth, and proximity could be informative about different social contexts of drinking. We define and evaluate seven social context inference tasks using smartphone sensing data, obtaining accuracies of the range 75%-86% in four two-class and three three-class inferences. Further, we discuss the possibility of identifying the sex composition of a group of friends using smartphone sensor data with accuracies over 70%. The results are encouraging towards supporting future interventions on alcohol consumption that incorporate users' social context more meaningfully and reducing the need for user self-reports when creating drink logs for self-tracking tools and public health studies.},

abstract = {Digital psychiatry is a rapidly growing area of research. Mobile assessment, including passive sensing, could improve research into human behavior and may afford opportunities for rapid treatment delivery. However, retention is poor in remote studies of depressed populations in which frequent assessment and passive monitoring are required. To improve engagement and understanding participant needs overall, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 people representative of a depressed population in a major metropolitan area. These interviews elicited feedback on strategies for long-term remote research engagement and attitudes towards passive data collection. Our results found participants were uncomfortable sharing vocal samples, need researchers to take a more active role in supporting their understanding of passive data collection, and wanted more transparency on how data were to be used in research. Despite these findings, participants trusted researchers with the collection of passive data. They further indicated that long term study retention could be improved with feedback and return of information based on the collected data. We suggest that researchers consider a more educational consent process, giving participants a choice about the types of data they share in the design of digital health apps, and consider supporting feedback in the design to improve engagement.},

abstract = {Many individuals find it difficult to meet their personal health and wellbeing goals. To address this, mobile health (mHealth) apps aimed at improving individuals' diet, physical activity, sleep and mental health, are emerging at an increasing pace. These modern digital health interventions are a promising solution to promote behaviour change and help people maintain better health while controlling rising healthcare expenditures. However, the real-life effects of mHealth apps are often overshadowed by high dropout rates, with the loss of participants during the intervention seeming to be the rule rather than the exception. We designed the mHealth4U model as a sample-based study of user requirement and design preferences to enable more targeted health and wellbeing self-management. This model is aimed at understanding how life-changing digital health interventions can be designed and what software design components might increase consumers' acceptance, adherence and continuous engagement. We put forward three hypotheses in terms of designing an mHealth app that is consumer-centred: consumers prefer (1) self-management mHealth apps that target multiple key health and wellbeing dimensions, (2) intelligent recommendations, and (3) behaviour change support delivered precisely where, when and how it is needed most. We design the mHealth4U model around the 3U cyber security design components (user, usage and usability) and validate the hypotheses through a randomised sampling test with 114 participants. The results of this research will inform the design of a next-generation of digital health interventions capable of supporting the end-users to achieve the healthy lifestyle they deserve.},

Recommending healthy activities is a core principle in Behavioral Activation (BA), which is typically done by the therapist. However, most BA smartphone applications do not recommend specific activities. This article reports quantitative results from an 8-week feasibility study of a previously presented smartphone-based BA recommender system. The system supports the planning and enacting of pleasurable activities and promotes activation of diverse activity types. Enrollment included 43 clinically depressed patients who installed the system on their phone and initiated activity scheduling. Twenty-nine patients used the system daily for more than a week.These patients presented a significant reduction in depressive symptoms during the study period. They displayed a more personalized usage approach and created recurring health goals comprising of their own customized activities. Furthermore, they took inspiration within various types of activities, thereby displaying more activity diversity. This study suggests that enacting a diverse mixture of activities that promote good sleep, personal hygiene, exercise, social contact, and leisure time can be essential in managing depressive symptoms. A smartphone-based activity recommender system can help patients achieve this.},

abstract = {Mental health symptoms are commonly discovered in primary care. Yet, these settings are not set up to provide psychological treatment. Digital interventions can play a crucial role in stepped care management of patients’ symptoms where patients are offered a low intensity intervention, and treatment evolves to incorporate providers if needed. Though digital interventions often use smartphone and wearable sensor data, little is known about patients’ desires to use these data to manage mental health symptoms. In 10 interviews with patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety, we explored their: symptom self-management, current and desired use of sensor data, and comfort sharing such data with providers. Findings support the use digital interventions to manage mental health, yet they also highlight a misalignment in patient needs and current efforts to use sensors. We outline considerations for future research, including extending design thinking to wraparound services that may be necessary to truly reduce healthcare burden.},

While EMAs have the advantage of low recall bias, a disadvantage is that they frequently interrupt the user and thus long-term adherence is generally poor. In this paper, we propose a less-disruptive self-reporting method, "assisted recall," in which in the evening individuals are asked to answer questions concerning a moment from earlier in the day assisted by contextual information such as location, physical activity, and ambient sounds collected around the moment to be recalled. Such contextual information is automatically collected from phone sensor data, so that self-reporting does not require devices other than a smartphone. We hypothesized that providing assistance based on such automatically collected contextual information would increase recall accuracy (i.e., if recall responses for a moment match the EMA responses at the same moment) as compared to no assistance, and we hypothesized that the overall completion rate of evening recalls (assisted or not) would be higher than for in-the-moment EMAs. We conducted a two-week study (N=54) where participants completed recalls and EMAs each day. We found that providing assistance via contextual information increased recall accuracy by 5.6% (p = 0.032) and the overall recall completion rate was on average 27.8% (p &lt; 0.001) higher than that of EMAs.},

This paper presents a digital intervention aimed at addressing the challenges encountered during the screening exercise. Therefore, we designed a mobile app, called Penapp, targeting retired individuals with the aim of designing a feedback system tailored to the needs of pensioners undergoing screening exercises in Ibadan North Local Government Area, Oyo State, Nigeria. To achieve this, we employ a user-centered design approach involving an interview session to understand participants' needs and preferences. Subsequently, we created a Low-Fidelity Prototype (LFP) and evaluated its features. The results of our evaluation provided valuable design suggestions to enhance the app's functionality. Building upon the LFP results and the recommendations received, we developed a High-Fidelity Prototype (HFP) that incorporates features from the LFP as well as the recommended improvements. Finally, we conducted user testing with the HFP, which yielded positive feedback and underscored the necessity of such an application.},

In this paper, we explore how an embodied, in-situ intervention in the form of a smart toy can impact emotion-related parent-child interactions in the home. We draw on (1) interviews with 29 parents of young children who had the smart toy for at least 1 month; (2) co-design workshops with 12 parents and 8 parenting course facilitators. We discuss how the smart toy impacted parent-child interactions around emotions for a subset of families, and draw on workshop data to explore how this could be designed for directly. Finally, we propose a set of design directions for technology-enabled systems aiming to elicit and scaffold specific parent-child interactions over time.},

We conducted an 8-week field experiment (N=71) to evaluate the effectiveness of both the adaptation and explanation aspects of Time2Stop. Our results indicate that our adaptive models significantly outperform the baseline methods on intervention accuracy (&gt;32.8% relatively) and receptivity (&gt;8.0%). In addition, incorporating explanations further enhances the effectiveness by 53.8% and 11.4% on accuracy and receptivity, respectively. Moreover, Time2Stop significantly reduces overuse, decreasing app visit frequency by 7.0 ∼ 8.9%. Our subjective data also echoed these quantitative measures. Participants preferred the adaptive interventions and rated the system highly on intervention time accuracy, effectiveness, and level of trust.

However, achieving digital change in healthcare is challenging, and careful planning is needed to ensure its success. Existing approaches for planning DHIs lack attention to ‘complexity’ that considers the heterogeneity of agents (e.g. people, process, technology and new behaviours), interactions between these agents and iterative adaptations of these interactions. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to explore the planning of digital change in healthcare by utilising evidence-, theory- and enhanced person-based approaches that aim to address the limited evidence on iterative approaches to planning digital change, elicitation of wider stakeholder views and involvement of vulnerable populations in planning of digital change. We aim to apply this methodology in the context of planning digital patient-reported measures collection systems for older adults aged 65 years and above to report their health status and experiences, in a public health community rehabilitation care setting.},

abstract = {The rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer is a serious threat to the society. Tobacco smoking is one of the most prevailing risk factors. Due to its addictiveness, it is often very difficult to quit. Abstinent smokers often start with a sudden craving for smoking which results in lapse and then permanent relapse. In this paper, we propose a sensor-based approach for automated recognition of smoking activity. That may be used for providing interventions in near real-time via mobile app to promote smoking cessation. A 6-axis inertial sensor along with a heart rate sensor is to be used to develop a wearable band which could be worn on the wrist. A pilot study is conducted with four participants. Their hand movement pattern is recorded for around 5 minutes for smoking and non-smoking intervals each, using a sensor based unit worn on the wrist. This period includes smoking and non-smoking intervals. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that there exists a periodicity in the data during the smoking episode. During non-smoking interval the sensor signals are random and does not exhibit such periodicity. Further data collection with more number of participants in different environments, data preprocessing, analysis, training, model generation, and testing is under progress. Preliminary results of this pilot study have been discussed.},

In particular, Reddit users freely discuss such issues on various subreddits, whose structure and content can be leveraged to formally interpret and relate subreddits and their posts in terms of mental health diagnostic categories. There is prior research on the extraction of mental health-related information, including symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments from social media; however, our approach can additionally provide actionable information to clinicians about the mental health of a patient in diagnostic terms for web-based intervention. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of the nature of subreddit content from domain expert's perspective and introduce a novel approach to map each subreddit to the best matching DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th Edition) category using multi-class classifier. Our classification algorithm analyzes all the posts of a subreddit by adapting topic modeling and word-embedding techniques, and utilizing curated medical knowledge bases to quantify relationship to DSM-5 categories. Our semantic encoding-decoding optimization approach reduces the false-alarm-rate from 30% to 2.5% over a comparable heuristic baseline, and our mapping results have been verified by domain experts achieving a kappa score of 0.84.},

abstract = {The recent growth of digital interventions for mental well-being prompts a call-to-arms to explore the delivery of personalised recommendations from a user’s perspective. In a randomised placebo study with a two-way factorial design, we analysed the difference between an autonomous user experience as opposed to personalised guidance, with respect to both users’ preference and their actual usage of a mental well-being app. Furthermore, we explored users’ preference in sharing their data for receiving personalised recommendations, by juxtaposing questionnaires and mobile sensor data. Interestingly, self-reported results indicate the preference for personalised guidance, whereas behavioural data suggests that a blend of autonomous choice and recommended activities results in higher engagement. Additionally, although users reported a strong preference of filling out questionnaires instead of sharing their mobile data, the data source did not have any impact on the actual app use. We discuss the implications of our findings and provide takeaways for designers of mental well-being applications.},

Implementation science is the scientific study of how to embed evidence-based interventions in practice. Calls to integrate implementation science and Human-Centred Design methods have focused on integrating design methods within implementation science processes. By contrast, we present a novel approach to integrating implementation science within Human-Centred Design for digital health interventions. Our approach leverages the socio-technical Nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework within the distinct phases of the Double Diamond process. To illustrate our proposal we demonstrate its application in the redesign of a brief health promotion intervention to reduce the risk of alcohol-attributable breast cancer in women attending routine mammography. We discuss reflections on the approach and implications for future research that targets implementation within design.},

abstract = {Behavioral medicine is devoting increasing attention to the topic of participant engagement and its role in effective mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions. Several definitions of the term "engagement" have been proposed and discussed, especially in the context of digital health behavioral interventions. We consider that engagement refers to specific interaction and use patterns with the mHealth tools such as smartphone applications for intervention, whereas adherence refers to compliance with the directives of the health intervention, independent of the mHealth tools. Through our analysis of participant interaction and self-reported behavioral data in a college student health study with incentives, we demonstrate an example of measuring "effective engagement" as engagement behaviors that can be linked to the goals of the desired intervention. We demonstrate how clustering of one year of weekly health behavior self-reports generate four interpretable clusters related to participants' adherence to the desired health behaviors: healthy and steady, unhealthy and steady, decliners, and improvers. Based on the intervention goals of this study (health promotion and behavioral change), we show that not all app usage metrics are indicative of the desired outcomes that create effective engagement. As such, mHealth intervention design might consider eliciting not just more engagement or use overall, but rather, effective engagement defined by use patterns related to the desired behavioral outcome.},

abstract = {Panic disorder is a serious condition that affects approximately six million adults in the United States per year. Reducing the severity of panic attack symptoms would allow a better quality of life for panic attack sufferers. This paper presents steps towards a mobile and wearable system that aims to help reduce the severity of symptoms experienced by individuals with this condition. The system provides a way to continuously monitor the physiological data of an individual via a wearable device. Users are able to report when panic attacks take place, along with a rating of the severity of symptoms experienced. Reported episodes provide ground truth data to build panic prediction models. The eventual goal of the system is to make predictions about approaching panic attacks and to deliver interventions that help the individual to cope with the approaching episode. We describe a mobile-based intervention that has been developed, which instructs the individual to perform breathing and relaxation exercises. Presently, the system has been utilized in a small pilot study where 10 individuals who suffer from panic disorder reported 29 panic attacks while collecting physiological data, along with the severity of symptoms. We found that out of 15 symptoms the ones with high severity reported were anxiety, worry and shortness of breath. Furthermore, physiological differences were observed between panic and non-panic intervals.},

A JITAI involves a sequence of decision rules (i.e., treatment policies) that take the user's current context as input and specify whether and what type of intervention should be provided at the moment. In this work, we describe a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that continuously learns and improves the treatment policy embedded in the JITAI as data is being collected from the user. This work is motivated by our collaboration on designing an RL algorithm for HeartSteps V2 based on data collected HeartSteps V1. HeartSteps is a physical activity mobile health application. The RL algorithm developed in this work is being used in HeartSteps V2 to decide, five times per day, whether to deliver a context-tailored activity suggestion.},

abstract = {There is a growing scientific interest in the use and development of just-in-time adaptive interventions in mobile health. These mobile interventions typically involve treatments, such as reminders, activity suggestions and motivational messages, delivered via notifications on a smartphone or a wearable to help users make healthy decisions in the moment. To be effective in influencing health, the combination of the right treatment and right delivery time is likely critical. A variety of prediction/detection algorithms have been developed with the goal of pinpointing the best delivery times. The best delivery times might be times of greatest risk and/or times at which the user might be most receptive to the treatment notifications. In addition, to avoid over burdening users, there is of ten a constraint on the number of treatments that should be provided per time interval (e.g., day or week). Yet there may be many more times at which the user is predicted or detected to be at risk and/or receptive. The goal then is to spread treatment uniformly across all of these times. In this paper, we introduce a method that spreads the treatment uniformly across the delivery times. This method can also be used to provide data for learning whether the treatments are effective at the delivery times. This work is motivated by our work on two mobile health studies, a smoking cessation study and a physical activity study.},

abstract = {Language delay is a developmental problem of children who do not acquire language as expected for their chronological ages. Without timely intervention, language delay can act as a lifelong risk factor. Speech-language pathologists highlight that effective parent participation in everyday parent-child conversation is important to treat children's language delay. For effective roles, however, parents need to alter their own lifelong-established conversation habits, requiring extensive period of conscious effort and staying alert. In this paper, we present new opportunities for mobile and social computing to reinforce everyday parent-child conversation with therapeutic implications for children with language delays. Specifically, we propose TalkBetter, a mobile in-situ intervention service to help parents in daily parent-child conversation through real-time meta-linguistic analysis of ongoing conversations. Through extensive field studies with speech-language pathologists and parents, we report the multilateral motivations and implications of TalkBetter. We present our development of TalkBetter prototype and report its performance evaluation.},

abstract = {Face-to-face health educational and intervention programs are helpful in addressing mental and physical illness challenges in focused groups. However, these programs are expensive, resource-intensive and struggle with scalability and reachability, leading to limited take-up and short-term impact. Digital Health Intervention (DHI) programs incorporate the use of technology - mobile, web, wearables, virtual and augmented reality - to address these limitations while being more cost-effective. DHIs have shown major success in improving physical and mental health outcomes for the general public as well as reducing adverse outcomes or high-risk groups. However, it is still very challenging and expensive to design and run high quality mobile-based DHI programs, in part due to the lack of technical skills of researchers in this field. Our proposed mobile eHealth Learning and Intervention Platform (eHeLP) aims to address these challenges with a novel approach that allows health researchers to focus on their studies, and participants to have access to multiple health programs that meet their needs. The platform caters for identified stakeholders in the DHI field and encourages the development of a new health-tech industry. We present our vision eHeLP, why this idea is worth further research, risks we perceive, and next steps.},

It is not surprising that many studies have been carried out to better understand migraine using statistical and machine learning techniques. Since such analysis needs both good-quality and sufficient data, it becomes important to investigate tools that allow to improve the data collection protocol. A data acquisition tailored for such a problem would allow us to better understand the most determinant triggers that precede a migratory crisis, especially because those vary significantly for each individual. In this work we designed and evaluated a protocol for data collection comprising an initial questionnaire and a diary of habits and events. Using a decision tree model, we found the main domains of migraine triggers in the studied group are stress, caffeine intake, sleep and effects of the environment. More importantly, we report the most important aspects and challenges when designing such a protocol so that to better engage users, as well as users' testimonials when using the tool.},

For these issues, theories suggest that small behavioral prompts delivered on a daily basis might be one effective way to motivate incremental shifts that accumulate into sustainable change. However, while this approach is appealing, we still know very little about how to design effective behavioral prompts that work in the context of everyday life. To fill this gap, we have developed a mobile intervention that sends people one sustainable lifestyle challenge every day. In a 20-day field trial with 139 participants, we collected logs from our mobile app, surveys, and post-study interviews. Participants completed a total of 1,921 daily challenges. In this paper, we report on participants' feelings and reactions to this daily challenge approach. This feedback suggests new design opportunities for mobile behavior interventions that use daily prompts.},

abstract = {A critical aspect of mobile just-in-time (JIT) health intervention is proper delivery timing, which correlates with successfully promoting target behaviors. Despite extensive prior studies on interruptibility, however, our understanding of the receptivity of mobile JIT health intervention is limited. This work extends prior interruptibility models to capture the JIT intervention process by including multiple stages of conscious and subconscious decisions. We built BeActive, a mobile intervention system for preventing prolonged sedentary behaviors, and we collected users' responses to a given JIT support and relevant contextual factors and cognitive/physical states for three weeks. Using a multi-stage model, we systematically analyzed the responses to deepen our understanding of receptivity using a mixed methodology. Herein, we identify the key factors relevant to each stage outcome and show that the receptivity of JIT intervention is nuanced and context-dependent. We propose several practical design implications for mobile JIT health intervention and context-aware computing.},

abstract = {Instant access and gratification make it difficult for us to self-limit the use of smartphone apps. We hypothesize that a slight increase in the interaction cost of accessing an app could successfully discourage app use. We propose a proactive intervention that requests users to perform a simple lockout task (e.g., typing a fixed length number) whenever a target app is launched. We investigate how a lockout task with varying workloads (i.e., pause only without number input, 10-digit input, and 30-digit input) influence a user's decision making, by a 3-week, in-situ experiment with 40 participants. Our findings show that even the pause-only task that requires a user to press a button to proceed discouraged an average of 13.1% of app use, and the 30-digit-input task discouraged 47.5%. We derived determinants of app use and non-use decision making for a given lockout task. We further provide implications for persuasive technology design for discouraging undesired behaviors.},

abstract = {Major depression is common, and imposes a high burden in terms of cost, morbidity, and suffering. Most people with depression are treated in general medicine using antidepressant medication. Outcomes are poor due to failure points across the care system, including patient non-adherence, failure of physicians to optimize the treatment regimens, and lack of patient-physician communication. This study reports on the 4-week pilot deployment of MedLink, a mobile intervention aimed at systemically addressing each of these failure points. A mobile app provides the patient with information and collects data on symptoms and side-effects. A cellularly enabled pill bottle monitors medication adherence. Data from these are provided to the physician and patient to foster communication and medication adjustments. Usability evaluation was generally favorable. Medication adherence rates in this first deployment were high with no patients discontinuing, and 84% of doses taken. Depressive symptom severity was significantly reduced. This study supports the use of a comprehensive, systemic approach to mHealth solutions to enhance processes of care for depression by general medicine physicians.},

abstract = {Problems initiating or maintaining sleep are prevalent and impact the quality of life negatively. Negative thinking patterns may perpetuate insomnia by inducing a state of arousal and consequently disrupting sleep. 'Thought challenging' is a common strategy to adopt a positive and peaceful mindset, but requires high awareness to internalize rational reasoning. Regular self-report and feedback may support the acquisition of fundamental reflection skills. We developed a thought journal in a mobile app to facilitate thought challenging. With the app, the users can reflect on daily situations and get visualized summaries as feedback. We carried out one week trial to explore perceived benefit, motivation, user engagement, and its integration with a sleep support tool. The results showed that using the app improved self-reflection skills and visualized summaries are perceived as motivating to log thoughts.},

abstract = {Emotion recognition is essential for assessing human emotional states and predicting user behavior to provide appropriate and personalized feedback. The wide range of Smartphones with accelerometers, microphones, GPSs, gyroscopes, and more motivate researchers to explore the automatic emotion detection through Smartphone sensors. To this end, mobile sensing can facilitate the data retrieval process in a non-intrusive way without disturbing the user's experience. This study seeks to contribute to the field of non-intrusive mobile sensing for emotion recognition by detecting user emotions via accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in Smartphones. A prototype gaming app was designed and a sensor log app for Android OS was used to monitor the users’ sensor data while interacting with the game. The recorded data from 40 users was processed and used to train different classifiers for two emotions: a positive (enjoyment) and a negative (frustration) one. The validation study demonstrates a high prediction of 87.90% for enjoyment and 89.45% for frustration. Our findings indicate that by analyzing accelerometer and gyroscope data, it is possible to make efficient predictions of a user's emotional state. The proposed model and its empirical development and validation are described in this paper.},

abstract = {Individuals with the knowledge of electrical energy consumed by them can take steps to reduce their energy footprint, which can lead to energy conservation. Current energy apportionment schemes either require prohibitively large amounts of user-appliance training or performs poorly in detecting user-appliance interaction when there are multiple users and appliances in close proximity to each other. In this paper, we build MotionSync, a privacy-aware, scalable and robust personal energy analytics system. The system exploits the similarity between the motions of user's arm/hand (captured through wrist-worn wearable) and appliance interface (captured through a motion tag) to determine user-appliance interaction. We show that commonly used plugload devices can be classified in five categories based on their interfaces - button, door, free-floating, knob and switch. Based on this, it is possible to train a generic machine learning model for each category to detect user-appliance interaction with a significant lower training overhead. MotionSync is privacy-aware and allows users to measure their own energy consumption without sharing any private information with building infrastructure. MotionSync is also robust to crowded scenarios since it does not depend on user's location. We implement and evaluate our system on a real testbed, and find that it can determine user-appliance interaction with an average accuracy of 92.5% and has low average false positive rate of 8.6%. We also show that pre-trained models of five interface types provide very high accuracy even for new and untrained appliances and users, eliminating per-appliance and per-user training overhead.},

abstract = {It is well documented that adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV, 10 -- 19 years) face numerous barriers that are associated with poor adherence to clinical visits and medications. These are exacerbated in resource poor settings where transport costs often limit face-to-face clinical interactions. Despite marked poverty in many regions of South Africa, there has been a significant rise in the number of households that report cell phone ownership, with smartphones showing strong market preference in recent years. In the face of AIDS-related mortality that disproportionately affects ALHIV, an interactive and purely visual mHealth application may provide a novel pathway to promote continuity of care among young people. This early stage research investigates the potential to leverage technology to mitigate some of the extant challenges experienced by HIV+ adolescents in South Africa. This phase of the study focuses on the application's reliability when used to collect and interpret self-reported data. Differentiating between symptom and sentiment is key, as adolescence is a period during which experiential interpretations are particularly confounding.},

We describe the design of the platform referring to principles from health care, persuasive system design and game design. The virtual coach is a game guide that can also provide personalized feedback about the user's daily care related activities which have value for making progress in the game world. We report about user evaluations in the wild which revealed that some assumptions made about how users are connected to the platform were not satisfied in reality, resulting in less optimal user experiences.

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate a first-of-its-kind adaptive intervention in a MOOC utilizing real-time clickstream data and a novel machine learned model of behavior. We detail how we augmented the edX platform with the capabilities necessary to support this type of intervention which required both tracking learners' behaviors in real-time and dynamically adapting content based on each learner's individual clickstream history. Our chosen pilot intervention was in the category of adaptive pathways and courseware and took the form of a navigational suggestion appearing at the bottom of every non-forum content page in the course. We designed our pilot intervention to help students more efficiently navigate their way through a MOOC by predicting the next page they were likely to spend significant time on and allowing them to jump directly to that page. While interventions which attempt to optimize for learner achievement are candidates for this adaptive framework, behavior prediction has the benefit of not requiring causal assumptions to be made in its suggestions. We present a novel extension of a behavioral model that takes into account students' time spent on pages and forecasts the same. Several approaches to representing time using Recurrent Neural Networks are evaluated and compared to baselines without time, including a basic n-gram model. Finally, we discuss design considerations and handling of edge cases for real-time deployment, including considerations for training a machine learned model on a previous offering of a course for use in a subsequent offering where courseware may have changed. This work opens the door to broad experimentation with adaptivity and serves as a first example of delivering a data-driven personalized learning experience in a MOOC.},

abstract = {Building occupants are complex in the aspects of the indoor environment that satisfies them. Thermal comfort-driven systems control, office floor plan design, and lighting or acoustics considerations are all driven by conventional understandings of how occupants use spaces. Building operators rely on the use of smart system control; however, these approaches ignore the occupants' ability to make decisions that influence their comfort, satisfaction, and productivity. The future-of-work paradigm shift will introduce more flexibility and behavior-driven opportunities for occupants. The emerging just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) concept is gaining momentum in fields such as mobile health as a means of influencing behavior. This paper outlines a novel methodology using smartwatch-based JITAI combined with micro-ecological momentary assessments (EMA) for field-based data collection and occupant behavior interventions in field-based scenarios. A proof-of-concept deployment of a single user of the methodology is illustrated to set the stage for future data collection. This framework can provide the foundation for techniques to enhance the future of work through behavioral interventions in the built environment.},

Moreover, Foodbot allows users to set goals and guides their behavior toward the goals via JIT notification prompts, interactive dialogues, and personalized recommendation.

abstract = {Effective and efficient management of chronic illness remains a significant clinical problem. To improve chronic illness management, two obstacles that must be overcome are patient non-adherence to medication regimens and provider therapeutic inertia (failure to respond in timely manner to clinical data). Using an iterative approach, behavioral theory was used to develop a mobile health (mHealth) medication and blood pressure self-management system that was patient and provider centered. Electronic medication trays provided reminder signals and smart phone text messages reminded patients to measure blood pressures using a Bluetooth-enabled monitor. Patients received mobile phone-delivered personalized motivational and reinforcement messages based upon adherence levels to these regimens. Two 3-month proof of concept randomized control trials were conducted with 2 patient groups; 1) Hispanics with uncontrolled essential hypertension (n=6), and 2) patients with hypertension after kidney transplantation. (n=6). Hispanic patients who received the mHealth intervention all exhibited significant improvements in both medication adherence and reductions in resting and 24-hour blood pressures during the trial and at 3-month follow-up, as compared to the control group.The still ongoing kidney transplant trial has shown that recipients randomized to the mHealth intervention have demonstrated significant improvements in medication adherence and reduced blood pressure two months into the trial. Following completion of both studies, patient and provider focus groups will allow further iterative refinement of the mHealth system and a feasibility trial of larger scale and longer duration.},

Any effective intervention in the stray dog problem must address the human role in the crisis.

Creating, mapping, and accessing these reports will help officials estimate the size and characteristics of the stray dog population, target humane population and disease control interventions, and identify communities in which to conduct public education. DogTracker can also provide information for citizens on movements of dogs and help citizens keep themselves and their communities safe from dangerous packs.},

abstract = {Understanding how social situations unfold in people’s daily lives is relevant to designing mobile systems that can support users in their personal goals, well-being, and activities. As an alternative to questionnaires, some studies have used passively collected smartphone sensor data to infer social context (i.e., being alone or not) with machine learning models. However, the few existing studies have focused on specific daily life occasions and limited geographic cohorts in one or two countries. This limits the understanding of how inference models work in terms of generalization to everyday life occasions and multiple countries. In this paper, we used a novel, large-scale, and multimodal smartphone sensing dataset with over 216K self-reports collected from 581 young adults in five countries (Mongolia, Italy, Denmark, UK, Paraguay), first to understand whether social context inference is feasible with sensor data, and then, to know how behavioral and country-level diversity affects inferences. We found that several sensors are informative of social context, that partially personalized multi-country models (trained and tested with data from all countries) and country-specific models (trained and tested within countries) can achieve similar performance above 90% AUC, and that models do not generalize well to unseen countries regardless of geographic proximity. These findings confirm the importance of the diversity of mobile data, to better understand social context inference models in different countries.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, a growing body of research in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has been accumulated using computer-assisted infield methods to assess self-report data, physiological data as well as environmental aspects of BPD patients in everyday life situations. In psychological and psychiatric research, the assessment method uniting all these aspects of assessment has been coined "Ambulatory Assessment". This method combines many advantages besides real-life and real-time assessment, e.g. objective and unobtrusive assessments as well as assessments of setting- or context-specificities. A seminal field of application is the use of electronic devices as therapeutic tools, giving interactive feedback to patients, i.e. providing interventions at the very moments when patients are most in need of additional support. By giving two examples of BPD diagnostic criteria, we outline the key technical needs in order to take the use of sensor technology in psychological research and therapy to a higher level. The following key technical needs have been identified: (1) tools for emotion detection providing an objective measure of current emotional states; (2) tools for identifying persons; (3) tools for detecting instances of self-destructive behavior like alcohol or drug use or speeding/reckless-driving; (4) tools for integrating and analyzing information of various sensors in order to give automated feedback to the patient in real time. In a nutshell, even though Ambulatory Assessment has been successfully used in BPD research over the past few years, the method may offer many more options of applications in research and even more in therapy. However, psychologists and psychiatrists lack the technological knowledge to realize possible new applications of Ambulatory Assessment. In order to increase the usefulness of Ambulatory Assessment in psychological research and therapy, multidisciplinary teams, including technology experts as well as clinical psychologists, are clearly needed.},

abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) has been presented as a viable solution for scaling timely and personalised feedback to support students’ self-regulated learning (SRL). Research is emerging that shows some positive associations between personalised feedback with students’ learning tactics and strategies as well as time management strategies, both important aspects of SRL. However, the definitive role of feedback on students’ SRL adaptations is under-researched; this requires an examination of students’ recalled experiences with their personalised feedback. Furthermore, an important consideration in feedback impact is the course context, comprised of the learning design and delivery modality. This mixed-methods study triangulates learner trace data from two different course contexts, with students’ qualitative data collected from focus group discussions, to more fully understand the impact of their personalised feedback and to explicate the role of this feedback on students’ SRL adaptations. The quantitative analysis showed the contextualised impact of the feedback on students’ learning and time management strategies in the different courses, while the qualitative analysis highlighted specific ways in which students used their feedback to adjust these and other SRL processes.},

abstract = {The act of re-engaging the unemployed into work is a crucial policy agenda and the main task of employment agencies. However, the means of accomplishing this task is challenging because the employment agencies have not helped much in given effective job search advice to job seekers in applying to the right vacancy. In recent times, behavioral economics research has revealed that people make systematic mistakes in decision-making. Most times job seekers fail in predictable ways not because they lack knowledge, practice, or willingness, but because they are limited in the way, they make decisions: "forces" that influence them (e.g., emotions, relativity, social norms, etc) trick the brains. However, this is not a helpless situation. Once the job seekers understand when and where they might make erroneous decisions in applying to the right vacancies. The goal of this research is to develop and compare different technological interventions and measure long-term their ability to provoke positive changes in the life of the users in applying for the right vacancies. The researchers intend to recruit 70 subjects (20-40 years) and to make use of a pre-assessment tool such as questionnaires, interact, and conduct surveys and interviews to administer to selected job seekers communities in order to measure their level of cognitive abilities and their link to human stress in the context of applying to the right vacancy. The researchers intend to collect three types of data from the selected subjects. The data include: (a) demographic data, (b) psychological data, which capture a subject's general susceptibility to stress and (c) self-report data, on the subject's stress and workload levels. Then, Ecological Momentarily Intervention (EMI) is use to examine how the users can be intervened with right context, encouragement, or support in the right moment in order to reduce their burden and increase intervention personalization in applying for the right vacancy.},

This study explores the work practices, challenges and roles of frontline health workers in community health with particular focus on pregnancy care in South India. Drawing on the notion of maintenance and articulation work, we describe the maintenance work of frontline health workers maintaining, anticipating, reconciling, and supporting care infrastructures beyond data collection practices. Our findings highlight how socio-cultural practices, perceptions, status, and existing systems influence maintenance work practices. Based on our findings, we suggest moving beyond the focus on training and performance to design CSCW tools to support the maintenance work of frontline health workers as 'system-builders' to make healthcare infrastructures work in community health.},

abstract = {Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) is an emerging technique with great potential to support health behavior by providing the right type and amount of support at the right time. A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions.We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.},

Increasingly, research has explored how mHealth tools can promote healthy behaviors within vulnerable populations-groups that disproportionately experience barriers to wellness. We conducted a systematic review of 83 papers from diverse disciplines to characterize the design and impact of mHealth tools in low-socioeconomic (low-SES) and racial/ethnic minority individuals. Our findings highlight that the diversity within low-SES and racial/ethnic minority groups was not reflected in the populations studied. Most studies focused on improving the health of individuals, often neglecting factors at the community and society levels that influence health disparities. Moreover, few improvements in health outcomes were demonstrated. We further discuss factors that acted as barriers and facilitators of mHealth intervention adoption. Our findings highlight trends that can drive critically needed digital health innovations for vulnerable populations.},

Given the critical role system usability plays in healthcare information system acceptance and adoption the prototype was created iteratively, following a user-centered design (UCD) approach. The process allowed to refine user requirements and to identify potential usability. The study showed that the intended end-users of the system well versed in the use of information systems and had high expectations, most importantly about how well the system design was aligned with the anticipated use scenarios. The UCD approach was successful in developing a useful system prototype that met end-user requirements and expectations as it aided in understanding how user background and prior experience influenced end-user perceptions and views.},

abstract = {We consider the actor-critic contextual bandit for the mobile health (mHealth) intervention. State-of-the-art decision-making algorithms generally ignore the outliers in the data-set. In this paper, we propose a novel robust contextual bandit method for the mHealth. It can achieve the conflicting goal of reducing the influence of outliers, while seeking for a similar solution compared with the state-of-the-art contextual bandit methods on the datasets without outliers. Such performance relies on two technologies: (1) the capped-L2 norm; (2) a reliable method to set the threshold hyper-parameter, which is inspired by one of the most fundamental techniques in the statistics. Although the model is non-convex and non-differentiable, we propose an effective reweighted algorithm and provide solid theoretical analyses. We prove that the proposed algorithm can sufficiently decrease the objective function value at each iteration and will converge after a finite number of iterations. Extensive experiment results on two datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve almost identical results compared with state-of-the-art contextual bandit methods on the dataset without outliers, and significantly outperform those state-of-the-art methods on the badly noised dataset with outliers in a variety of parameter settings.},

abstract = {While technology based health interventions can be effective, high attrition rates are commonly observed in research and practice and are a major issue in eHealth. Research on adherence has recently gained some scientific attention, but little has been done as to how technology itself engages users. It seems plausible that technology plays a role in persuading people to use an eHealth intervention and keep on using it. The present study seeks to apply the PSD-model with regard to this major issue in eHealth. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the databases Web of Knowledge, EBSCOHOST, Picarta, Scopus and ScienceDirect. The following characteristics were coded: Health care domain, Study level, Sample size, Intended usage, Usage web-based intervention, Adherence, Predictors of adherence, Intervention, Interaction, Persuasive technology in the intervention. The search yielded 4939 unique titles, of which 460 articles were deemed relevant. After title, abstract and full text screening by two researchers, 109 articles were included. Concluding, we can say that it seems that when designing web-based interventions, most attention is given to support the primary task. Dialogue support and social support appear neglected. Taking into account that more extensive use of persuasive technology seems to be positively related to adherence, more attention should be paid to all forms of support through technology.},

abstract = {Various wearable sensors capturing body vibration, jaw movement, hand gesture, etc., have shown promise in detecting when one is currently eating. However, based on existing literature and user surveys conducted in this study, we argue that a Just-in-Time eating intervention, triggered upon detecting a current eating event, is sub-optimal. An eating intervention triggered at "About-to-Eat" moments could provide users with a further opportunity to adopt a better and healthier eating behavior. In this work, we present a wearable sensing framework that predicts "About-to-Eat" moments and the "Time until the Next Eating Event". The wearable sensing framework consists of an array of sensors that capture physical activity, location, heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature and caloric expenditure. Using signal processing and machine learning on this raw multimodal sensor stream, we train an "About-to-Eat" moment classifier that reaches an average recall of 77%. The "Time until the Next Eating Event" regression model attains a correlation coefficient of 0.49. Personalization further increases the performance of both of the models to an average recall of 85% and correlation coefficient of 0.65. The contributions of this paper include user surveys related to this problem, the design of a system to predict about to eat moments and a regression model used to train multimodal sensory data in real time for potential eating interventions for the user.},

There is a large amount of studies conducted on mHealth intervention, but the amount of study conducted for this particular target group is relatively small. In order to develop a mobile intervention for wellness of menopausal women, we identify design considerations for supporting their wellness with mobile devices. We assume 9 functions we believed the target domain need to use their mobile application for their wellness and conduct interviews with a focus group including middle aged women and members of stakeholder. As a result, we were able to conclude that the mobile health intervention system would need to provide 1)SNS function that users can actively share their health information with others, 2)message function that enables application to send text information on health management, 3) reliable source from doctors, and 4)visualized personal information that users can easily understand.},

abstract = {Exploratory efforts in mobile health (mHealth) data collection and sharing have achieved promising results. However, fine-grained contextual access control and real-time data sharing are two of the remaining challenges in enabling temporally-precise mHealth intervention. We have developed an NDN-based system called mGuard to address these challenges. mGuard provides a pub-sub API to let users subscribe to real-time mHealth data streams, and uses name-based access control policies and key-policy attribute-based encryption to grant fine-grained data access to authorized users based on contextual information. We evaluate mGuard's performance using sample data from the MD2K project.},

We report findings from 2 workshops with 13 people living with Long Covid, indicating the challenges of making sense of their physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, and of monitoring the triggers of post-exertional malaise. While most participants engage in pacing activities for the self-management of fatigue, only a few are aware of the importance of planning all their daily activities and routines in order to avoid post-exertional malaise. We conclude with design implications to support lightweight tracking and sensemaking of fatigue symptoms, novel data analytics for monitoring the triggers of post-exertional malaise and the worsening of symptoms, and support for self-management in order to prevent post-exertional malaise.},

abstract = {Breathing biomarkers, such as breathing rate, fractional inspiratory time, and inhalation-exhalation ratio, are vital for monitoring the user's health and well-being. Accurate estimation of such biomarkers requires breathing phase detection, i.e., inhalation and exhalation. However, traditional breathing phase monitoring relies on uncomfortable equipment, e.g., chestbands. Smartphone acoustic sensors have shown promising results for passive breathing monitoring during sleep or guided breathing. However, detecting breathing phases using acoustic data can be challenging for various reasons. One of the major obstacles is the complexity of annotating breathing sounds due to inaudible parts in regular breathing and background noises. This paper assesses the potential of using smartphone acoustic sensors for passive unguided breathing phase monitoring in a natural environment. We address the annotation challenges by developing a novel variant of the teacher-student training method for transferring knowledge from an inertial sensor to an acoustic sensor, eliminating the need for manual breathing sound annotation by fusing signal processing with deep learning techniques. We train and evaluate our model on the breathing data collected from 131 subjects, including healthy individuals and respiratory patients. Experimental results show that our model can detect breathing phases with 77.33% accuracy using acoustic sensors. We further present an example use-case of breathing phase-detection by first estimating the biomarkers from the estimated breathing phases and then using these biomarkers for pulmonary patient detection. Using the detected breathing phases, we can estimate fractional inspiratory time with 92.08% accuracy, the inhalation-exhalation ratio with 86.76% accuracy, and the breathing rate with 91.74% accuracy. Moreover, we can distinguish respiratory patients from healthy individuals with up to 76% accuracy. This paper is the first to show the feasibility of detecting regular breathing phases towards passively monitoring respiratory health and well-being using acoustic data captured by a smartphone.},

abstract = {Mobile sensing is a ubiquitous and useful tool to make inferences about individuals' mental health based on physiology and behavior patterns. Along with sensing features directly associated with mental health, it can be valuable to detect different features of social contexts to learn about social interaction patterns over time and across different environments. This can provide insight into diverse communities' academic, work and social lives, and their social networks. We posit that passively detecting social contexts can be particularly useful for social anxiety research, as it may ultimately help identify changes in social anxiety status and patterns of social avoidance and withdrawal. To this end, we recruited a sample of highly socially anxious undergraduate students (N=46) to examine whether we could detect the presence of experimentally manipulated virtual social contexts via wristband sensors. Using a multitask machine learning pipeline, we leveraged passively sensed biobehavioral streams to detect contexts relevant to social anxiety, including (1) whether people were in a social situation, (2) size of the social group, (3) degree of social evaluation, and (4) phase of social situation (anticipating, actively experiencing, or had just participated in an experience). Results demonstrated the feasibility of detecting most virtual social contexts, with stronger predictive accuracy when detecting whether individuals were in a social situation or not and the phase of the situation, and weaker predictive accuracy when detecting the level of social evaluation. They also indicated that sensing streams are differentially important to prediction based on the context being predicted. Our findings also provide useful information regarding design elements relevant to passive context detection, including optimal sensing duration, the utility of different sensing modalities, and the need for personalization. We discuss implications of these findings for future work on context detection (e.g., just-in-time adaptive intervention development).},

It has been suggested that digital solutions might be useful to monitor caregivers’ health and well-being, by providing early intervention and support. Given the importance of self-disclosure for psychological health, here we aimed to investigate the potential of employing a social robot for eliciting self-disclosure among informal caregivers over time. We conducted a longitudinal experiment across a five-week period, measuring participants’ disclosure duration (in seconds) and length (in number of words). Our preliminary results show a positive trend where informal caregivers speak for a longer time and share more information in their disclosures to a social robot across the five-week period. These results provide useful evidence supporting the potential deployment of social robots as intervention tools to help provide support for individuals suffering from stress and experiencing challenging life situations.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in sensing techniques for mHealth applications have led to successful development and deployments of several mHealth intervention designs, including Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI). JITAIs show great potential because they aim to provide the right type and amount of support, at the right time. Timing the delivery of a JITAI such as the user is receptive and available to engage with the intervention is crucial for a JITAI to succeed. Although previous research has extensively explored the role of context in users' responsiveness towards generic phone notifications, it has not been thoroughly explored for actual mHealth interventions. In this work, we explore the factors affecting users' receptivity towards JITAIs. To this end, we conducted a study with 189 participants, over a period of 6 weeks, where participants received interventions to improve their physical activity levels. The interventions were delivered by a chatbot-based digital coach -Ally - which was available on Android and iOS platforms.We define several metrics to gauge receptivity towards the interventions, and found that (1) several participant-specific characteristics (age, personality, and device type) show significant associations with the overall participant receptivity over the course of the study, and that (2) several contextual factors (day/time, phone battery, phone interaction, physical activity, and location), show significant associations with the participant receptivity, in-the-moment. Further, we explore the relationship between the effectiveness of the intervention and receptivity towards those interventions; based on our analyses, we speculate that being receptive to interventions helped participants achieve physical activity goals, which in turn motivated participants to be more receptive to future interventions. Finally, we build machine-learning models to detect receptivity, with up to a 77% increase in F1 score over a biased random classifier.},

abstract = {With individual behaviour and lifestyle determining 30-50% of people's health, research and supportive technology for affecting behaviour alteration remain urgently needed. Most existing persuasive systems are designed to persuade a user to change a finite set of behaviours to achieve a specific goal. However, if the user's situation or goal changes, such systems cannot adapt to the changes. A much more robust type of persuasive system is needed today to enable adequate health navigation and to empower people to face and change their own realities in terms of a large variety of health behaviours and lifestyles. In this paper, we provide a perspective on the impressive body of work contributed over the past 15 years, to better look into the future of persuasive health and to the opportunities a broader theoretical framework and practical methodologies may bring about. We present a taxonomy that attempts to explain the contributions in this field including health behaviour theory, cybernetic action-behaviour models, social cognitive theory, and control theory. We identify potentially promising approaches to advance persuasive health's efficacy in empowering individuals to improve their own health outcomes.},

In this paper, we propose the SedentaryBar, a context-aware reminding system using an always-on progress bar to show the duration of a working session, as an alternative to the prompt. The new reminding system uses both users' keyboard/mouse events on the computer and the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithm with the webcam to detect users' presence, which makes the system more accurate and intelligent. Our evaluation study compared the SedentaryBar and the prompt using subjective and objective measurements. After using each method for a week respectively, more participants preferred the SedentaryBar. The participants' perceived interruption and usefulness also suggested the SedentaryBar was more popular during the study. However, the logged data of the participants' working durations indicated the prompt was more effective in reducing their sedentary behavior.},

However, these methods lack providing real time personalized intervention messages to the smoking addicted users. The challenge is to develop an automated smoking behavior detection. We address this challenge by proposing a non-invasive sensor based automated framework for smoking behavior detection. We used a wristband based accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect smoking activities, differentiating with the closely confounding activities. We extract several features using learning algorithms and the empirical results with our participants show good accuracy in detecting the smoking activity in terms of precision, recall, and Flscore.},

abstract = {An important step towards assessing smoking behavior is to detect and log smoking episodes in an unobtrusive way.

Both prototypes capture and record instances when the user smokes, and are sufficiently robust and power efficient to allow deployments of several weeks. A real-world feasibility study with 11 frequently-smoking participants investigates the deployment and adoption of the system, hinting that smokers are generally unaware of their daily smoking patterns, and tend to overestimate their consumption.},

abstract = {Smartphone sensing and persuasive feedback design is enabling a new generation of wellbeing applications capable of automatically monitoring multiple aspects of physical and mental health. In this paper, we present BeWell+ the next generation of the BeWell smartphone health app, which continuously monitors user behavior along three distinct health dimensions, namely sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new wellbeing mechanisms to address challenges identified during the initial deployment of the BeWell app; specifically, (i) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which automatically generalize to diverse user communities (e.g., elderly, young adults, children) by balancing the need to promote better behavior yet remains realistic to the user's goals; and, (ii) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions of wellbeing (e.g., social interaction) where the user needs most help. We evaluate the performance of these mechanisms as part of an initial deployment and user study that includes 27 people using BeWell+ over a 19 day field trial. Our findings show that not only can BeWell+ operate successfully on consumer-grade smartphones, but users understand feedback and respond by taking positive steps towards leading healthier lifestyles.},

abstract = {We present ERICA, a digital personal trainer for users performing free weights exercises, with two key differentiators: (a) First, unlike prior approaches that either require multiple on-body wearables or specialized infrastructural sensing, ERICA uses a single in-ear "earable" device (piggybacking on a form factor routinely used by millions of gym-goers) and a simple inertial sensor mounted on each weight equipment; (b) Second, unlike prior work that focuses primarily on quantifying a workout, ERICA additionally identifies a variety of fine-grained exercising mistakes and delivers real-time, in-situ corrective instructions. To achieve this, we (a) design a robust approach for user-equipment association that can handle multiple (even 15) concurrently exercising users; (b) develop a suite of statistical models to detect several commonplace repetition-level mistakes; and (c) experimentally study the efficacy of multiple in-situ corrective feedback strategies. Via an end-to-end evaluation of ERICA with 33 participants naturally performing 3 dumbbell-based exercises, we show that (a) ERICA identifies over 94% of mistakes during the first 5 repetitions of a set, (b) the resulting feedback is viewed favorably by 78% of users, and (c) the feedback is effective, reducing mistakes by 10+% during subsequent repetitions.},

However, results for telehealth efficacy are conflicting partially because of barriers to adoption by end-users. Developing an understanding of users' needs helps to reduce barriers of adoption by allowing service designers to create meaningful experiences. We conduct interviews as part of a case study in a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care pathway in Greece. Following a user-centered design approach, we describe the goals, tasks, and needs of healthcare professionals as four user profiles. The implications of our findings bring to light a deeper understanding of the attitudes and perceptions of healthcare professionals towards telehealth, as well as a core set of user needs for telehealth service designers.},

abstract = {Self-harm is a prevalent issue amongst young people, yet it is thought around 40% will never seek professional help due to stigma surrounding it. It is generally a way of coping with emotional distress and can have a range of triggers which are highly heterogeneous to the individual. In a move towards enhancing the accessibility of personalized interventions for self-harm, we undertook a three-stage study. We first conducted interviews with 4 counsellors in self-harm to understand how they clinically respond to self-harm triggers. We then ran a survey with 37 young people, to explore perceptions of mobile sensing, and current and future uses for smartphone-based interventions. Finally, we ran a workshop with 11 young people to further explore how a context-aware self-management application might be used to support them. We contribute an in-depth understanding of how triggers for self-harm might be identified and subsequently predicted and prevented using mobile-sensing technology.},

However, their use poses special challenges and few articles have reported specifically on digital technology interventions for vulnerable populations. This article shares our experience from the Tika Vaani ("vaccine voice") Intervention which uses a combined face-to-face and mHealth strategy to educate and empower beneficiaries to improve immunization uptake and child health for a poor, low-literate population in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. Based on the mERA checklist, a guide to improve the completeness of reporting mHealth interventions, we provide information about the process of development, implementation and lessons for scaling up the Tika Vaani intervention. This study contributes to the literature to improve reporting on mHealth interventions and provide researchers with key points and actions to take during intervention development to serve hard-to-reach communities and improve health outcomes.},

abstract = {Modern stress management techniques have been shown to be effective, particularly when applied systematically and with the supervision of an instructor. However, online workers usually lack sufficient support from therapists and learning resources to self-manage their stress. To better assist these users, we implemented a browser-based application, Home Sweet Office (HSO), to administer a set of stress micro-interventions which mimic existing therapeutic techniques, including somatic, positive psychology, meta cognitive, and cognitive behavioral categories. In a four-week field study, we compared random and machine-recommended interventions to interventions that were self-proposed by participants in order to investigate effective content and recommendation methods. Our primary findings suggest that both machine-recommended and self-proposed interventions had significantly higher momentary efficacy than random selection, whereas machine-recommended interventions offer more activity diversity compared to self-proposed interventions. We conclude with reflections on these results, discuss features and mechanisms which might improve efficacy, and suggest areas for future work.},

abstract = {As stated in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, poor mental well-being is one of the biggest problems we are facing worldwide. One possible way of addressing it is through interventions delivered via digital devices since they are scalable, ubiquitous and inexpensive. This is also confirmed by the ever-growing plethora of e-health mobile apps being developed. Although these apps rely to some extent on scientific bases, there is still much work to do to understand the effect of specific digital interventions on app users. To shed light on these effects, we ask what types of interventions within the app have the most significant impact on well-being, and to what extent longer engagement leads to improved outcomes. These questions could be answered with dedicated Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), which are generally expensive, time-consuming, and single-purposed. To overcome these difficulties, we adopt instrumental variables on a combination of data collected in an RCT, behavioural data from the app, and a randomized recommender system, to evaluate intervention and app dose-response effects on users’ self-reported well-being. Thus, we present a general causal inference approach for extending results from collected data in RCTs applied in the context of digital health intervention. Following this approach, we show how to measure the impact of different types of activities on the users’ well-being. This allows us to identify the most impactful activities in the app (namely, sleep and relaxation activities), which have direct implications for the app design. On the other hand, we prove the positive effect of longer app usage.},

We explore the application of Self-Affirmation Theory on smartphone overuse intervention in a just-in-time manner. We present TypeOut, a just-in-time intervention technique that integrates two components: an in-situ typing-based unlock process to improve user engagement, and self-affirmation-based typing content to enhance effectiveness. We hypothesize that the integration of typing and self-affirmation content can better reduce smartphone overuse. We conducted a 10-week within-subject field experiment (N=54) and compared TypeOut against two baselines: one only showing the self-affirmation content (a common notification-based intervention), and one only requiring typing non-semantic content (a state-of-the-art method). TypeOut reduces app usage by over 50%, and both app opening frequency and usage duration by over 25%, all significantly outperforming baselines. TypeOut can potentially be used in other domains where an intervention may benefit from integrating self-affirmation exercises with an engaging just-in-time mechanism.},

Communities such as churches play important roles in supporting wellbeing and addressing health inequities. While some work has investigated creating digital health tools for religious populations, few have explicitly focused on the incorporation of community support in the form of prayer support. Embedding health interventions in any community has the potential to support or challenge the community’s dynamics. We report on findings from interviews with 17 church members who used a church-based mHealth application over a 4-week period and provide guidelines for developers based on these results. Through their use of the system, participants characterized several community dynamics including a desire for social intimacy, communicating care, creating opportunities for fellowship, maintaining privacy and discretion, and building community connections, and how these dynamics influence their aspirations for a church-based health app.},

abstract = {Serious mental illnesses (SMIs) like depression, bipolar disorder, etc. are one of the dire health concerns throughout the world. According to WHO, depression is one of the prime causes of disability with 350 million people suffering from it globally. Patients with SMIs require prolonged care and management which in long term adversely affects the caregiver's health. Existing studies leverage the potential of mobile technology to build healthcare systems for mental illnesses. Most of these studies are patient centric with an aim to assist patients in self-management of their illness. The studies focused only on patients have neither exploited the potential of caregiver's role, nor have explored the solutions for managing their burden. We aim to provide a solution that leverage the role of caregivers in providing healthy cooperation between the patients and the doctors in managing SMIs. In this paper we present our work in progress --Harmony - a system designed to encourage the patients in adopting an efficient morning routine. Aim of the current prototype is to reduce the morning efforts of the caregiver by assisting the patient in becoming independent.},

Their functionality, however, is currently limited to being passive answer machines rather than proactively engaging users in conversations. Speakers' proactivity would open up a range of important application scenarios, including health services, such as checking in on patient states and triggering medication reminders. It remains unclear how passive speakers should implement proactivity. To better understand user perceptions, we ran a 3-week field study with 13 participants where we modified the off-the-shelf Google Home to become proactive. During the study, our speaker proactively triggered conversations that were essentially Experience Sampling probes allowing us to identify when to engage users. Applying machine-learning, we are able to predict user responsiveness with a 71.6% accuracy and find predictive features. We also identify self-reported factors, such as boredom and mood, that are significantly correlated with users' perceived availability. Our prototype and findings inform the design of proactive speakers that verbally engage users at opportune moments and contribute to the design of proactive application scenarios and voice-based experience sampling studies.},

abstract = {As the number of smart devices that surround us increases, so do the possibilities of leveraging them to create intelligent, socially-aware systems. However, apart from e-health systems, few applications consider humans as active system players. In fact, most applications/systems have the sole objective of providing some service to humans without considering their intents, actions or emotions. In this respect, they can be looked at as open loop. Systems that do consider human feedback are called Human-in-the-Loop Cyber-Physical-Systems (HiTLCPS), and integrate the humans in a feedback loop, with potential to react and change the environment. In this paper, we propose an approach that implements the HITLCPS concept. The developed platform, ISABELA, explores both online social networks (OSN) data as well as a variety of other data, including environment data and data from personal mobile devices, thus combining IoT, social sensors and mobile sensing. In addition to present the system architecture, the paper provides preliminary results obtained during field trials.},

abstract = {Personality traits describe individual differences in patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving ("between-person" variability). But individuals also show changes in their own patterns over time ("within-person" variability). Existing approaches to measuring within-person variability typically rely on self-report methods that do not account for fine-grained behavior change patterns (e.g., hour-by-hour). In this paper, we use passive sensing data from mobile phones to examine the extent to which within-person variability in behavioral patterns can predict self-reported personality traits. Data were collected from 646 college students who participated in a self-tracking assignment for 14 days. To measure variability in behavior, we focused on 5 sensed behaviors (ambient audio amplitude, exposure to human voice, physical activity, phone usage, and location data) and computed 4 within-person variability features (simple standard deviation, circadian rhythm, regularity index, and flexible regularity index). We identified a number of significant correlations between the within-person variability features and the self-reported personality traits. Finally, we designed a model to predict the personality traits from the within-person variability features. Our results show that we can predict personality traits with good accuracy. The resulting predictions correlate with self-reported personality traits in the range of r = 0.32, MAE = 0.45 (for Openness in iOS users) to r = 0.69, MAE = 0.55 (for Extraversion in Android users). Our results suggest that within-person variability features from smartphone data has potential for passive personality assessment.},

Rehabilitation programs are mostly offered at specific times and locations (e.g., clinical facilities or in-home exercise programs), which are the root causes of participation barriers. We envision that use of mobile and wearable technologies can overcome such spatial/temporal restrictions and offer novel opportunities for promoting physical activities in their everyday lives. In this work, we introduce BeActive, a mobile-based intervention platform that delivers just-in-time intervention messages to help patients to be more active in their daily lives. The key innovation of BeActive is to leverage fine-grained tracking of user behaviors to deliver just-in-time feedback and to incentivize health behavior maintenance via micro financial rewards. To show the feasibility of BeActive, we conducted a preliminary study for seven days (n=5), and presented several design improvements for just-in-time health intervention.},

abstract = {Passive detection of risk factors (that may influence unhealthy or adverse behaviors) via wearable and mobile sensors has created new opportunities to improve the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. A key goal is to find opportune moments for intervention by passively detecting rising risk of an imminent adverse behavior. But, it has been difficult due to substantial noise in the data collected by sensors in the natural environment and a lack of reliable label assignment of low- and high-risk states to the continuous stream of sensor data. In this paper, we propose an event-based encoding of sensor data to reduce the effect of noises and then present an approach to efficiently model the historical influence of recent and past sensor-derived contexts on the likelihood of an adverse behavior. Next, to circumvent the lack of any confirmed negative labels (i.e., time periods with no high-risk moment), and only a few positive labels (i.e., detected adverse behavior), we propose a new loss function. We use 1,012 days of sensor and self-report data collected from 92 participants in a smoking cessation field study to train deep learning models to produce a continuous risk estimate for the likelihood of an impending smoking lapse. The risk dynamics produced by the model show that risk peaks an average of 44 minutes before a lapse. Simulations on field study data show that using our model can create intervention opportunities for 85% of lapses with 5.5 interventions per day.},

Simultaneously, labels are criticized for giving standardized recommendations that overlook individual needs. To assess the potential of consumer-specific tailored labels, we thus developed and tested a tailoring logic for adapting labels to individual dietary requirements and a smartphone app that then provided tailored food labels after scanning a product's barcode. The tailoring logic was developed with dieticians, accounting for gender, age, activity, preferences, diet-related diseases. The label showed a combination of established labelling systems: Nutri-Score and Multiple Traffic Light. The application followed a smart-RCT design, randomly attributing users either with tailored or standardized labels. 33 users met the eligibility criteria for our exploratory study. We found promising evidence that tailored digital food labels are perceived as more helpful, relevant, and recommendable than current static food labels, especially in the absence of FoPL.},

abstract = {Geriatrics research has highlighted the importance of managing routine health and fitness for older adults to improve their quality of life. Correspondingly, public health organizations have given specific guidelines on recommended levels of physical activities for this age group. Despite these efforts, many older adults do not engage in physical activities. Fitness technologies such as wearable activity trackers can motivate people to be regular in their physical activities. However, the adoption and usage of these devices among older adults remains low, especially in developing countries. We present findings from a longitudinal qualitative study with five older adults from India who use wearable activity trackers. We wanted to understand how they currently use these devices and what barriers they face in getting the most out of them. We trained the participants to help them overcome some of these barriers. Though initially, participants used their trackers only to track their steps, they could learn to use these devices more proactively after our training sessions. From the study findings, we suggest that activity trackers incorporate short how-to videos in local languages, speech input, voice prompts, personalized feedback on progress, and Q&amp;A chat-bots to help older adults overcome some barriers.},

abstract = {While the popularity of online social network (OSN) apps continues to grow, little attention has been drawn to the increasing cases of Social Network Addictions (SNAs). In this paper, we argue that by mining OSN data in support of online intervention treatment, data scientists may assist mental healthcare professionals to alleviate the symptoms of users with SNA in early stages. Our idea, based on behavioral therapy, is to incrementally substitute highly addictive newsfeeds with safer, less addictive, and more supportive newsfeeds. To realize this idea, we propose a novel framework, called Newsfeed Substituting and Supporting System (N3S), for newsfeed filtering and dissemination in support of SNA interventions. New research challenges arise in 1) measuring the addictive degree of a newsfeed to an SNA patient, and 2) properly substituting addictive newsfeeds with safe ones based on psychological theories. To address these issues, we first propose the Additive Degree Model (ADM) to measure the addictive degrees of newsfeeds to different users. We then formulate a new optimization problem aiming to maximize the efficacy of behavioral therapy without sacrificing user preferences. Accordingly, we design a randomized algorithm with a theoretical bound. A user study with 716 Facebook users and 11 mental healthcare professionals around the world manifests that the addictive scores can be reduced by more than 30%. Moreover, experiments show that the correlation between the SNA scores and the addictive degrees quantified by the proposed model is much greater than that of state-of-the-art preference based models.},

Behavioral interventions delivered through electronic communication modalities (e.g., text messaging) can reduce the frequency of HDEs in young adults, but effects are small. One way to amplify these effects is to deliver support materials proximal to drinking occasions, but this requires knowledge of when they will occur. Mobile phones have built-in sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns associated with the initiation of drinking occasions. The objective of our work is to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone sensors and their utility in identifying drinking occasions. We utilized data from 30 young adults aged 21-28 with past hazardous drinking and collected mobile phone sensor data and daily Experience Sampling Method (ESM) of drinking for 28 consecutive days. We built a machine learning-based model that is 96.6% accurate at identifying non-drinking, drinking and heavy drinking episodes. We highlight the most important features for detecting drinking episodes and identify the amount of historical data needed for accurate detection. Our results suggest that mobile phone sensors can be used for automated, continuous monitoring of at-risk populations to detect drinking episodes and support the delivery of timely interventions.},

abstract = {Recent advances in miniaturization of ultra-low power components allow for more intelligent wearable health monitors. Such systems may be used in a wide range of application areas. Here, the development and evaluation of a wireless wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor to detect epileptic seizures from changes in the cardiac rhythm is described. The ECG is measured using an ultra-low-power circuit for bio-potential acquisition. The ECG data is continuously analyzed by embedded algorithms: a robust beat-detection algorithm combined with a real-time heart beat-based epileptic seizure detector. Each detected seizure candidate triggers its transmission to a receiving radio-station. At the same time, the detected events and the raw ECG data are stored on an embedded memory card from which they can be wirelessly downloaded for off-line analysis. The performance of the system in terms of power-consumption, robustness of the radio-link and comfort of use is reported. In its current implementation, the proposed ECG-monitor prototype has a size of 52x36x15mm3, and an autonomy of one day. Wireless, miniaturized and comfortable, this prototype opens new perspectives for continuous and ambulatory health monitoring.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of an ongoing study into the potential role of mobile or wireless health applications for targeting the prevention of excessive gestational weight gain in pregnant lower-income American women. Informed by a qualitative study of pregnant women's experiences, we develop a set of design requirements for designing mobile health (mHealth) interventions related to healthy pregnancies. We identify a disconnection between physical activity and food tracking application design paradigms, and the reality of pregnant women's lives and capacities. We introduce the concept of an individualized pregnancy ecology, which provides an alternative paradigm for design of health and wellness management tools for lower-income pregnant women.},

abstract = {Health interventions aim to influence behavior by creating healthy habits that substitute existing unhealthy ones. Habits are often deeply ingrained but also easily disrupted in new situations. This makes the changing of habits a life-long learning and adaptation process rather than a one-time task with limited duration. Therefore, modern understanding of learning may be applied in designing effective and sustainable health interventions. We have designed the "Mindless Change" mobile intervention based on a framework of modern learning theories. The self-intervention guides the user in a habit formation through small daily changes, supported by a user selectable simple cartoon type of avatar with varied dialogue. We conducted a four-week pilot study with 66 participants to assess the feasibility of our intervention and especially the contribution of the avatar. Users found the self-intervention intuitive and easy to use but the attrition remained a challenge in this open pilot where participants were not provided any external motivation, support or incentives to start and continue using the service. The results suggest that even a simple non-anthropomorphic support avatar can be beneficial for the health intervention, which encourages us to investigate the concept further.},

abstract = {Delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium for long-term health behavior management. But active experimentation of treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily, this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people. We also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models to this complex real-world data, including which contextual features appear to be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness.},

abstract = {Healthcare delivery is one of the crucial services in every country. While the education sector train health professionals, the available health facilities are unable to employ majority of the qualified health professionals to offer the required essential services. This leads to the unemployment of qualified health professionals in some countries. In this paper, we focus on the case of Ghana, West Africa to develop a conceptual framework on how to utilize mobile technology to deliver basic healthcare services and to create employment opportunities. This framework ensures registration of graduate nurses/health professionals to assist in delivering basic healthcare services to mobility challenged including aged persons. Identified gaps in the delivery of basic healthcare services in Ghana were taken into consideration in formulating the proposed conceptual framework to guide the implementation of a mHealth application. Data was collected from both healthcare professionals (total number of 5) and patients (total number of 15) from a hospital in the Volta region of Ghana. The data was used to evaluate the proposed framework and the finding suggests that health professionals who are the respondents do not utilize mobile phone platforms in healthcare delivery to aged persons in Ghana. Similarly, respondents who are patients would like to use mobile phone platform to request for the service of healthcare professional.},

However, this remains a challenge in traditional classrooms where providing frequent, timely, and personalized feedback is not always possible. Analytics can scaffold the writing development of English Language Learners (ELLs) by providing such feedback. To design these analytics, we conducted a field study analyzing essay samples from immigrant adult ELLs (a group often overlooked in writing analytics research) and identifying their epistemic beliefs and learning motivations. We identified common themes across individual learner differences and patterns of errors in the writing samples. The study revealed strong associations between epistemic writing beliefs and learning strategies. The results are used to develop guidelines for designing writing analytics for adult ELLs, and to propose ideas for analytics that scaffold writing development for this group.},

In this paper, we propose a mobile application platform for children's education that supports personalized learning through flexible customization of the contents based on learning objectives. The framework provides a web-based interface through which educators and instructors can design instructional materials, test and validate the effectiveness of the materials on children's learning. It also provides an easy, fun and interactive mobile-based interface on a mobile smart device for the children to play and learn educational materials. The framework is fully customizable and provides educators with a platform to conduct research on children's learning and collect useful data.},

abstract = {The development and validation studies of new multisensory biomarkers and sensor-triggered interventions requires collecting raw sensor data with associated labels in the natural field environment. Unlike platforms for traditional mHealth apps, a software platform for such studies needs to not only support high-rate data ingestion, but also share raw high-rate sensor data with researchers, while supporting high-rate sense-analyze-act functionality in real-time. We present mCerebrum, a realization of such a platform, which supports high-rate data collections from multiple sensors with realtime assessment of data quality. A scalable storage architecture (with near optimal performance) ensures quick response despite rapidly growing data volume. Micro-batching and efficient sharing of data among multiple source and sink apps allows reuse of computations to enable real-time computation of multiple biomarkers without saturating the CPU or memory. Finally, it has a reconfigurable scheduler which manages all prompts to participants that is burden- and context-aware. With a modular design currently spanning 23+ apps, mCerebrum provides a comprehensive ecosystem of system services and utility apps. The design of mCerebrum has evolved during its concurrent use in scientific field studies at ten sites spanning 106,806 person days. Evaluations show that compared with other platforms, mCerebrum's architecture and design choices support 1.5 times higher data rates and 4.3 times higher storage throughput, while causing 8.4 times lower CPU usage.},

Technological interventions, such as mobile and wearable health systems, can support data collection and reflection about health status. However, little is known about how ADHD children interpret such data. We conducted a deployment study with 10 children, aged 10 to 15, for six weeks, during which they used a smartwatch in their homes. Results from observations and interviews during this study indicate that children with ADHD can interpret their own health data, particularly at the moment. However, as ADHD children develop more autonomy, smartwatch systems may require alternatives for data reflection that are interpretable and actionable for them. This work contributes to the scholarly discourse around health data visualization, particularly in considering implications for the design of health technologies for children with ADHD.},

abstract = {Many individuals with speech disorders are unable to access speech therapies due to a lack of trained professionals and available resources. To address this issue, there has been an increased focus on using eHealth technologies for remote therapy delivery. For example, there exists a number of mobile applications that aim to deliver different speech therapy exercises (e.g., listening to an audio prompt and repeating it). However, current approaches often are not able to provide personalized feedback or adapt to users’ unique needs. Such limitations can impede skill development for practical communications. Furthermore, the current approaches might not support therapeutic alliance — a key factor in determining speech therapy outcomes. In this challenge paper, we explore how voice assistants (VAs) can potentially enable remote delivery of speech therapies at scale. We also describe design challenges that need to be addressed before VAs can be used to deliver speech therapies.},

Important principles for effectiveness of such systems are personalisation or tailoring, context-awareness, feedback and interaction. We focus here on the presentation of feedback to the user. We present results of a number of short and long term user studies in which we compare different forms of feedback presentation: text, graphics and with or without an anthropomorphic graphical talking character. Results show that although some users like the talking character they don't have a positive effect on adherence to the activity program. The outcomes of the user evaluations support our beliefs that personal motivation is of primary importance for the effectiveness of these systems. Technical challenges ahead are to support more personal and context-aware feedback, more variations as well as the possibility for more interaction with the coaching system.},

Cross sectional, semi-structured interviews (N = 22) were then conducted to explore technology support needs concerning ESRE behavior. Findings revealed participants had the following needs: holistic health goal development, building motivation to achieve goals, and assistance with handling stress. Resulting HIT guidelines include supporting holistic health goals, developing and sustaining motivation, exchange of emotional support, understanding of behavior, and change in ESRE mindset.},

In this paper, we propose a new method to detect moment-by-moment conversation episodes by analyzing breathing patterns captured by a mobile respiration sensor. Since breathing is affected by physical and cognitive activities, we develop a comprehensive method for cleaning, screening, and analyzing noisy respiration data captured in the field environment at individual breath cycle level. Using training data collected from a speech dynamics lab study with 12 participants, we show that our algorithm can identify each respiration cycle with 96.34% accuracy even in presence of walking. We present a Conditional Random Field, Context-Free Grammar (CRF-CFG) based conversation model, called rConverse, to classify respiration cycles into speech or non-speech, and subsequently infer conversation episodes. Our model achieves 82.7% accuracy for speech/non-speech classification and it identifies conversation episodes with 95.9% accuracy on lab data using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Finally, the system is validated against audio ground-truth in a field study with 32 participants. rConverse identifies conversation episodes with 71.7% accuracy on 254 hours of field data. For comparison, the accuracy from a high-quality audio-recorder on the same data is 71.9%.},

abstract = {EcoSant\'{e} is a mobile lifestyle intervention that encourages individual behavior change while also helping participants understand the deep connections between daily lifestyle choices and our collective impact on the planet. Informed by research on “small” intervention approaches, we sent participants daily behavioral challenges that demonstrated connections between personal health and environmental impact at large. Through a 20-day mobile intervention study, 139 participants uploaded 1,920 submissions documenting their attempts to engage in these challenges. We found that participants’ self-reported healthy eating behavior and general self-efficacy improved significantly immediately after the intervention. Moreover, 30 days after the intervention, participants’ self-reported eating, exercise, and general self-efficacy all significantly improved compared to the beginning of the study. Participants had a more negative reaction when being asked to come up with their own challenges. Based on quantitative and qualitative findings, we provide implications for future researcher on mobile behavior intervention research.},

abstract = {Enabling real-time collection and analysis of cyclist sensor data could allow amateur cyclists to continuously monitor themselves, receive personalized feedback on their performance, and communicate with each other during cycling events. Semantic Web technologies enable intelligent consolidation of all available context and sensor data. Stream reasoning techniques allow to perform advanced processing tasks by correlating the consolidated data to enable personalized and context-aware real-time feedback. In this paper, these technologies are leveraged and evaluated to design a Proof-of-Concept application of a personalized real-time feedback platform for amateur cyclists. Real-time feedback about the user's heart rate and heart rate training zones is given through a web application. The performance and scalability of the platform is evaluated on a Raspberry Pi. This shows the potential of the framework to be used in real-life cycling by small groups of amateur cyclists, who can only access low-end devices during events and training.},

abstract = {Players across the health ecosystem are initiating studies of thousands, even millions, of participants to gather diverse types of data, including biomedical, behavioral, and lifestyle in order to advance medical research. These efforts to collect multi-modal data sets on large cohorts coincide with the rise of broad activity and behavior tracking across industries, particularly in healthcare and the growing field of mobile health (mHealth). Government and pharmaceutical sponsored, as well as patient-driven group studies in this arena leverage the ability of mobile technology to continuously track behaviors and environmental factors with minimal participant burden. However, the adoption of mHealth has been constrained by the lack of robust solutions for large-scale data collection in free-living conditions and concerns around data quality. In this work, we describe the infrastructure Evidation Health has developed to collect mHealth data from millions of users through hundreds of different mobile devices and apps. Additionally, we provide evidence of the utility of the data for inferring individual traits pertaining to health, wellness, and behavior. To this end, we introduce and evaluate deep neural network models that achieve high prediction performance without requiring any feature engineering when trained directly on the densely sampled multivariate mHealth time series data. We believe that the present work substantiates both the feasibility and the utility of creating a very large mHealth research cohort, as envisioned by the many large cohort studies currently underway across therapeutic areas and conditions.},

Based on weekly interviews with five individuals with depression, conducted over six weeks, this study identifies design opportunities and challenges related to extending technology-based support across fluctuating symptoms. Our findings suggest that participants perceive events and contexts in daily life to have marked impact on their symptoms. Results also illustrate that ebbs and flows in symptoms profoundly affect how individuals practice depression self-management. While digital tools often aim to reach individuals while they feel depressed, we suggest they should also engage individuals when they are less symptomatic, leveraging their energy and motivation to build habits, establish plans and goals, and generate and organize content to prepare for symptom onset.},

A multiple linear regression model is then developed for each food-type to map second-level features to calories per second. We conducted a user study in a patient simulated setting, where 10 participants were asked to eat on a patient bed. A user-independent analysis demonstrated food-type detection at 97.2% F1-Score, and an average Absolute Error of 3.0 kCal per food-type. Our method shows promise in distinguishing food items and predicting calorie intake in a bedridden setting given a limited set of food items.},

We conducted a 1-2 week home study to explore how people with chronic pain use wearable technology that senses and sonifies movement (i.e., movement mapped to sound in real-time) to do functional activity (e.g., loading the dishwasher). Our results show that real-time movement sonification led to an increased sense of control during challenging everyday tasks. Sonification calibrated to functional activity facilitated application of pain management techniques such as pacing. When calibrated to individual needs, sonification enabled serendipitous discovery of physical capabilities otherwise obscured by a focus on pain or a dysfunctional proprioceptive system. A physiotherapist was invited to comment on the implications of our findings. We conclude by discussing opportunities provided by wearable sensing technology to enable better functioning, the ultimate goal of physical rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have the potential to improve the user experience of digital mental health apps. Personalised recommendations can help users to identify therapy tasks that they find most enjoyable or helpful, thus boosting their engagement with the service and optimising the extent to which it helps them to feel better. Using a dataset containing 23,476 ratings collected from 973 players of a mental health therapy game, this work demonstrates how collaborative filtering algorithms can predict how much a user will benefit from a new therapy task with greater accuracy than a simpler baseline algorithm that predicts the average rating for a task, adjusted for the biases of the specific user and specific task. Collaborative filtering algorithms (matrix factorisation and k-nearest neighbour) outperform this baseline with a 6.5-8.3% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and context-aware collaborative filtering algorithms (factorisation machines) outperform with a 7.8-8.8% improvement in MAE. These results suggest that recommender systems could be a useful tool for tailoring recommendations of new therapy tasks to a user based on a combination of their past preferences, the ratings of similar users, and their current context. This scalable approach to personalisation – which does not require a human therapist to always be in-the-loop – could play an important role in improving engagement and outcomes in digital mental health therapies.},

Three years of trace data were collected from online pre-class activities of a flipped classroom, where different types of feedback were employed in each year. Clustering, sequence mining, and process mining were used to detect and interpret learning tactics and strategies. Inferential statistics were used to examine the association of feedback with the learning performance and the detected learning strategies. The results suggest a positive association between the personalised feedback and the effective strategies.},

We explored (1) catalysts for taking the screener, (2) anticipated outcomes, (3) reactions to the results, and (4) desired next steps. For many participants, the screener results validated their lived experiences of symptoms, but they were nevertheless unsure how to use the information to improve their mental health moving forward.

abstract = {Understanding individual's exercise motives, participation patterns in a gym and reasons for dropout are essential for designing strategies to help gym-goers with long-term exercise adherence. In this work, we derive insights on various exercise-related behaviors of gym-goers, including evidence of a significant number of individuals exhibiting early dropout and also describing their attitudes towards digital technologies for sustained gym participation. By utilizing gym visitation data logs of 6513 individuals over a longitudinal period of 16 months in a campus gym, we show the retention and dropout rates of gym-goers. Our data indicates that 32% of the people quit their gym activity after initial 1 or 2 visits and about 65% of the users have less than 10 visits during the 16 months period. From this data, we also observed that people attending gym in a group and following a regular visiting time to the gym have a lower chance of ceasing gym activity. Further by surveying 615 individuals across varying demographics, we uncover the key reasons for dropout to be "lack of knowledge in using gym equipment" and "lack of access to a personal trainer", besides the prominent reason of "lack of time". Our survey also indicates the propensity of individuals towards using digital technologies (e.g., fitness apps) to track their gym activity. Somewhat surprisingly, our survey reveals a disinclination among individuals to use obtrusive wearable-based solutions in a gym, with 60% of them preferring a less-invasive and more convenient approach of machine-attached sensors for automated tracking of gym exercises.},

This requires methods for representing and updating the user model, including goals, preferences, abilities, activity and its situation. We focus the assessment and intervention tasks typically performed by therapists and provide knowledge-based technology for supporting the process. A formative evaluation study was conducted as a part of a participatory action research process, involving two rehabilitation experts, two young individuals and one senior individual as end-user participants, in addition to knowledge engineers. The main contribution of this work is a theory-based method for assessing the individual's goals, preferences, abilities and motives, which is used for building a holistic user model. The user model is continuously updated and functions as the base for tailoring the system's assistive behavior during intervention and follow-up.},

abstract = {Today, so-called persuasive or motivational technologies are developing, which refer to technologies, applications or services designed to induce changes in attitudes and behavior in those who use them. This is the subject of research in Human-Computer Interaction in connection with theories from psychology related, for example, to behavior change or motivation. Research on these technologies suggests that in order to encourage long-term adherence, these "virtual coaches" need to be personalized and/or tailored according to the individual characteristics of the users (stage of behavior change, motivations, preferences, barriers). For example, according to the Self-Determination Theory (SDT), an individual can present different forms of motivation, more or less effective. The idea is to be able to identify the forms of motivation present in users in order to propose services to reinforce or develop them. The use of such systems in the field of health has the potential to induce and reinforce health behaviors that are sometimes difficult to establish by health professionals. Providing daily, personalized care represents a considerable human and financial cost for health professionals. A mobile application has the advantage of being able to deal with these constraints. The computer coach is designed with and for patients suffering from chronic low back pain. The aim is to help them manage their condition, particularly with regard to their pain and the practice of regular physical activity. The work presented presents an innovative design approach, combining user-centered methodologies and psychological theories, which we detail through a research phase and a design phase. Currently, a first version of the application has been developed and is being tested.},

abstract = {Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) have the potential to provide effective support for health behavior by delivering the right type and amount of intervention at the right time. The timing of interventions is crucial to ensure that users are receptive and able to use the support provided. Previous research has explored the association of context and user-specific traits on receptivity and built machine-learning models to detect receptivity after the study was completed. However, for effective intervention delivery, JITAI systems need to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. In this study, we deployed machinelearning models in a chatbot-based digital coach to predict receptivity for physical-activity interventions. We included a static model that was built before the study and an adaptive model that continuously updated itself during the study. Compared to a control model that sent intervention messages randomly, the machine-learning models improved receptivity by up to 36%. Receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over time.},

abstract = {Mobile health (mHealth) applications have become increasingly valuable in preventive healthcare and in reducing the burden on healthcare organizations. The aim of this article is to investigate the factors that influence user acceptance of mHealth apps and identify the underlying structure that shapes users’ behavioral intention. An online study that employed factorial survey design with vignettes was conducted, and a total of 1,669 participants from eight countries across four continents were included in the study. Structural equation modeling was employed to quantitatively assess how various factors collectively contribute to users’ willingness to use mHealth apps. The results indicate that users’ digital literacy has the strongest impact on their willingness to use them, followed by their online habit of sharing personal information. Users’ concerns about personal privacy only had a weak impact. Furthermore, users’ demographic background, such as their country of residence, age, ethnicity, and education, has a significant moderating effect. Our findings have implications for app designers, healthcare practitioners, and policymakers. Efforts are needed to regulate data collection and sharing and promote digital literacy among the general population to facilitate the widespread adoption of mHealth apps.},

The pervasiveness of relevant devices could have a powerful impact on enabling patients self-monitoring and increasing public awareness on the air they breathe. In this study, we investigated a variety of different sensors devices relevant to the monitoring of air quality and different devices for assessing the condition of asthma. Our approach at this stage has been based on feature comparison based on product specification sheets and published case studies. We found that there is no standardisation among such devices and that in order for someone to deliver a holistic intervention for the management of a condition like asthma, a significant amount of proprietary effort to integrate third party data and technologies would be required. Such a solution would include both typical air quality sensing and asthma indicators monitoring, but also elements to seamlessly integrate sensed data and logic about the management of the condition.},

To bridge this gap, we conducted an in-situ study on building an open dataset with mobile and wearable devices for affective computing research (N = 100, 4 weeks). Our study results showed that a mixture of financial and altruistic benefits was important in eliciting data contribution. Sensor-specific risks were largely associated with the revelation of personal traits and social behaviors. However, most of the participants were less concerned with open dataset collection and their perceived sensitivity of each sensor data did not change over time. We further discuss alternative approaches to promote data contributors' motivations and suggest design guidelines to alleviate potential privacy concerns in mobile open dataset collection.},

We addressed these gaps by exploring user reviews of such apps to better understand user experiences and ethical issues. We conducted a thematic analysis of 2,217 user reviews sampled from 40 depression apps in Google Play and Apple App Store, totaling over 77,500 words. Users reported positive and negative experiences, with ethical implications evident in areas of benefits, adverse effects, access, usability and design, support, commercial models, autonomy, privacy, and transparency. We integrated our elements of ethically designed apps for depression and principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, autonomy, and virtue, and we conclude with implications for ethical design of apps for depression.},

A wearable system that can continuously monitor upper-limb performance has been considered as an effective clinical solution for its potential to provide patient-centered, data-driven feedback to improve the motor dosage. Towards that end, we investigate a system leveraging a pair of finger-worn, ring-type accelerometers capable of monitoring both gross-arm and fine-hand movements that are clinically relevant to the performance of daily activities. In this work, we conduct a mixed-methods study to (1) quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of finger-worn accelerometers in measuring clinically relevant information regarding stroke survivors' upper-limb performance, and (2) qualitatively investigate design requirements for the self-monitoring system, based on data collected from 25 stroke survivors and seven occupational therapists. Our quantitative findings demonstrate strong face and convergent validity of the finger-worn accelerometers, and its responsiveness to changes in motor behavior. Our qualitative findings provide a detailed account of the current rehabilitation process while highlighting several challenges that therapists and stroke survivors face. This study offers promising directions for the design of a self-monitoring system that can encourage the affected limb use during stroke survivors' daily living.},

abstract = {eHealth coaching is a promising approach for delivering effective, person-centered, digital health interventions. Yet, the way eHealth coaches ‘tailor’ interventions using technology is currently unclear. This study aims to understand how eHealth coaches tailor support to clients seeking to lose weight. Nine in-depth interviews with eHealth coaches were conducted. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis, deriving three themes: ‘Understanding the client,’ ‘Adapting Support,’ and ‘Navigating challenges.’ Coaches used both assessment tools and their growing relationship to understand client's needs. Coaches adapted the pace and nature of educational content, utilized their clients' preferred technologies, and adopted different personas to meet the needs of each individual. Providing tailored support also presented challenges for eHealth coaches, with technology eroding personal and professional boundaries. Our work interrogates what it means to ‘tailor’ support, through exploring coaching as a humanistic approach to behaviour change, with implications for the design of person-centered digital coaching interventions/systems.},

abstract = {Personalization is a key aspect when developing applications targeting health behaviour change. However, the use of personalized mobile interventions for lifestyle behaviour is still in its infancy. Based on our former research on mobile applications to support cardiac patients in health behaviour change, we identified four key motivations to enhance the personalization offered in applications targeting health behaviour change. In this paper, we propose a mixed-methods approach, using both qualitative and quantitative data collected in prior studies, to apply personalization in the design of health applications. Our approach consists of five steps: 1) collecting data for personalization, 2) detecting patient profiles using clustering methods, 3) understanding patient profiles using a graphical representation, 4) describing patient profiles using personas, and 5) personalizing a health application according to patient profiles. One of the major strengths of our approach is that it combines established HCI techniques such as personas and data visualization techniques with methods from big data analytics and artificial intelligence to identify ways to personalize health applications. We conclude by presenting future directions to apply personalization in the domain of health technologies.},

abstract = {Although social anxiety and depression are common, they are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part due to difficulties identifying and accessing individuals in need of services. Current assessments rely on client self-report and clinician judgment, which are vulnerable to social desirability and other subjective biases. Identifying objective, nonburdensome markers of these mental health problems, such as features of speech, could help advance assessment, prevention, and treatment approaches. Prior research examining speech detection methods has focused on fully supervised learning approaches employing strongly labeled data. However, strong labeling of individuals high in symptoms or state affect in speech audio data is impractical, in part because it is not possible to identify with high confidence which regions of a long speech indicate the person's symptoms or affective state. We propose a weakly supervised learning framework for detecting social anxiety and depression from long audio clips. Specifically, we present a novel feature modeling technique named NN2Vec that identifies and exploits the inherent relationship between speakers' vocal states and symptoms/affective states. Detecting speakers high in social anxiety or depression symptoms using NN2Vec features achieves F-1 scores 17% and 13% higher than those of the best available baselines. In addition, we present a new multiple instance learning adaptation of a BLSTM classifier, named BLSTM-MIL. Our novel framework of using NN2Vec features with the BLSTM-MIL classifier achieves F-1 scores of 90.1% and 85.44% in detecting speakers high in social anxiety and depression symptoms.},

Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors.

abstract = {Problem behaviors are particularly common in children with neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism and Down syndrome. These behaviors sometimes discourage social inclusion, inhibit learning development, and cause severe injuries, but caregivers are often unable to attend to their children immediately when the behaviors occur. Recent research shows that problem behavior can be automatically detected with wearable devices, but it is still not clear how to reduce caregivers' burdens and facilitate academic, social, and functional development of children with problem behaviors. We conducted a field study at a school with 21 children who exhibit problem behaviors and found that they needed frequent interventions in the form of visual cue cards and verbal reminders. We then developed a proof-of-concept that uses smart watch notifications to help children control their behavior without intervention from caregivers. A preliminary evaluation indicates that notifications modeled after teachers' current intervention strategies can help children control their problem behaviors.},

abstract = {Mobile health applications for weight maintenance offer self-monitoring as a tool to empower users to achieve health goals (e.g., losing weight); yet maintaining consistent self-monitoring over time proves challenging for users. These apps use push notifications to help increase users’ app engagement and reduce long-term attrition, but they are often ignored by users due to appearing at inopportune moments. Therefore, we analyzed whether delivering push notifications based on time alone or also considering user context (e.g., current activity) affected users’ engagement in a weight maintenance app, in a 4-week in-the-wild study with 30 participants. We found no difference in participants’ overall (across the day) self-monitoring frequency between the two conditions, but in the context-based condition, participants responded faster and more frequently to notifications, and logged their data more timely (as eating/exercising occurs). Our work informs the design of notifications in weight maintenance apps to improve their efficacy in promoting self-monitoring.},

abstract = {Programming skills are rapidly becoming essential for many educational paths and career opportunities. Yet, for many international students, the traditional approach to teaching introductory programming courses can be a significant challenge due to the complexities of the language, the lack of prior programming knowledge, and the language and cultural barriers. This study explores how large language models and gamification can scaffold coding learning and increase Chinese students’ sense of belonging in introductory programming courses. In this project, a gamification intelligent tutoring system was developed to adapt to Chinese international students’ learning needs and provides scaffolding to support their success in introductory computer programming courses. My research includes three studies: a formative study, a user study of an initial prototype, and a computer simulation study with a user study in progress. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through surveys, observations, focus group discussions and computer simulation. The preliminary findings suggest that GPT-3-enhanced gamification has great potential in scaffolding introductory programming learning by providing adaptive and personalised feedback, increasing students’ sense of belonging, and reducing their anxiety about learning programming.},

However, very little is known about how communities currently use or view TMH tools, how these technologies represent their values, and what they see as opportunities for community-based TMH use. In this study, we explored the potential for TMH tools to meet the mental health needs of youth. We present the results of a series of focus groups with teens, young adults, parents, clinicians, and educators to understand their unique perspectives on the challenges and opportunities for using TMH tools in times of stress and crisis. This paper provides a multi-stakeholder analysis of TMH issues surrounding their integration into everyday life and a set of socio-technical design considerations for the next generation of community-based TMH technologies.},

Users often face gaps when the system’s responses do not align with their goals and intentions. We explore these gaps through a prototype system that enables users to specify context-action intervention rules as they desire. We conducted a lab study to understand how users perceive and cope with gaps while translating their intentions as rules, revealing that users experience context-mapping and context-recognition uncertainties (instant evaluation cycle). We also performed a field study to explore how users perceive gaps and make adaptations of rules when the operation of specified rules in real-world settings (delayed evaluation cycle). This research highlights the dynamic nature of user interaction with context-aware systems and suggests the potential of such systems in supporting digital well-being. It provides insights into user adaptation processes and offers guidance for designing user-centric context-aware applications.},

However, many challenges remain to deploy such systems in actual homes, such as achieving robustness, unobtrusiveness, fault tolerance, privacy, and minimal user burden. This paper presents how these challenges were overcome in the realization and successful prototype deployment of the Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention (BESI) system. BESI is designed to sense behavioral activities using wearables and monitor environmental parameters with in-home sensors. With such data, behavioral patterns can then be modeled to determine associations with environmental attributes and, when appropriate, real-time notifications or interventions can be made based on these models. Challenges in building platforms with residential deployment constraints are discussed. BESI is currently deployed for an in-home study on dementia, and the results are presented to illustrate data collection procedures and system performance.},

This paper presents a novel approach to assistive technologies for mental health. In our approach, the paired combination of a wearable device --- in the form of a scarf --- and an accompanying mobile app, helps mitigate anxiety symptoms whenever they start to arise. This approach differs from conventional ubiquitous technologies developed for dealing with mental health, both in the role the mobile app plays in the process and in the way the intervention is delivered to users. SCAARF offers a more subtle, less obtrusive method for coping with anxiety. We discuss the results of an initial (three-week-long) evaluation of SCAARF with anxiety-suffering users. Qualitative results suggest that the SCAARF mobile app is effective in helping users relax and cope with anxious states of mind.},

abstract = {As demand for design education increases, instructors are struggling to provide timely, personalized feedback for student projects. Gathering feedback from classroom peers and external crowds offer scalable approaches, but there is little evidence of how they compare. We report on a study in which students (n=127) created early- and late-stage prototypes as part of nine-week projects. At each stage, students received feedback from peers and external crowds: their own social networks, online communities, and a task market. We measured the quality, quantity and valence of the feedback and the actions taken on it, and categorized its content using a taxonomy of critique discourse. The study found that peers produced feedback that was of higher perceived quality, acted upon more, and longer compared to the crowds. However, crowd feedback was found to be a viable supplement to peer feedback and students preferred it for projects targeting specialized audiences. Feedback from all sources spanned only a subset of the critique categories. Instructors may fill this gap by further scaffolding feedback generation. The study contributes insights for how to best utilize different feedback sources in project-based courses.},

It uses a neck-mounted infrared camera (IR), which takes pictures of the head from the neck. These IR camera images are processed and used to train a deep-learning model to recognize and predict touch time and positions. The study showed D-Touch distinguished 17 Facial related Activity (FrA), including 11 face touch positions and 6 other activities, with over 92.1% accuracy and predict the hand-touching T-zone from other FrA activities with an accuracy of 82.12% within 150 ms after the hand appeared in the camera. A study with 10 participants conducted in their homes without any constraints on participants showed that D-Touch can predict the hand-touching T-zone from other FrA activities with an accuracy of 72.3% within 150 ms after the camera saw the hand. Based on the study results, we further discuss the opportunities and challenges of deploying D-Touch in real-world scenarios.},

Narrative structures, both visual and textual, help us understand and act on information, while also evoking strong emotions. Focusing on the health context, this research examines the effectiveness of narrative-based feedback in motivating physical activity behaviors and underlying attitudes over longitudinal periods. After collecting two weeks of baseline physical activity levels, N=39 participants installed our smartphone application, WhoIsZuki. The WhoIsZuki app supports goal setting and semi-automated activity tracking, and it provides an ambient display that visually encodes these tracked activities as well as progress toward goals. Half of participants received a version of the interface that supplied behavioral feedback in the form of a multi-chapter episodic narrative, while the other half received a control condition version that provided an aesthetically-similar visualization but without any characterization, episodic structure, dramatic effect, or other narrative elements. After interacting with these versions for four months, our analysis showed that participants receiving the multi-chapter narrative feedback performed more physical activity, achieved more goals, experienced more positive psychological shifts, and overall engaged more meaningfully with the digital intervention.},

abstract = {Numerous studies aim to enhance learning in digital environments through emotionally-sensitive interventions. The D’Mello and Graesser (2012) model of affect dynamics hypothesizes that when a learner encounters confusion, the degree to which it is prolonged (and transitions into frustration) or resolved, significantly affects their learning outcomes in digital environments. However, studies yield inconclusive results regarding relations between confusion, frustration, and learning. More research is needed to explore how confusion and frustration manifest during learning and its relation to outcomes. We go beyond past work looking at the rate, duration, and transitions of confusion and frustration by treating these affective states as non-linear dynamical systems consisting of expressive and behavioral components. We examined the frequency and recurrence of facial expressions associated with basic emotions (as automatically labeled by AffDex, a standard tool for analyzing emotions with video data) during confused and frustrated states (as automatically labeled with BROMP-based detectors applied to students’ interaction data). We compare these co-occurring patterns to learning outcomes (pre-tests, post-tests, and learning gains) within a digital learning environment, Betty’s Brain. Results showed that the frequency and recurrence rate of basic emotions expressed during confusion and frustration are complex and remain incompletely understood. Specifically, we show that confusion and frustration have different relationships with learning outcomes, depending on which basic emotion expressions they co-occur with. Implications of this study open avenues for better understanding these emotions as complex and non-linear dynamical systems, in the long-term enabling personalized feedback and emotional support within digital learning environments that enhance learning outcomes.},

These interactive systems help users make changes in their behavior by, for instance, tracking healthrelated activities and states, providing feedback, helping users set and track goals, and facilitating supportive social interactions. We refer to the features that implement such functionality as the system's "intervention components," as they are designed to actuate psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., modeling, selfefficacy, positive reinforcement, etc.) thought to mediate the behavior change process. As with any other type of behavioral intervention, mHealth systems are only effective for some users and some of the time, but insofar as they do work, they do so mainly through the mechanisms of change that are activated via users' interactions with the system's intervention components.},

Physical activity (PA) in individuals with SCI is positively associated with improved mental and physical health outcomes. Mobile technologies have been developed to motivate individuals with SCI to increase PA using activity tracking and real-time feedback. We conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with 15 manual wheelchair users with SCI and eight of their family members/friends to investigate user impressions of future technologies that might use computer-mediated, sensor-triggered communication to motivate PA. We assessed barriers to PA and how context-aware communication could help overcome them. Participants with SCI expressed that PA tracking and communication technologies must be tailored to their specific needs. Further analysis revealed that context-aware messaging could help participants with SCI connect with others to initiate timely conversations about overcoming PA barriers, and to provide encouragement to meet their PA goals. We discuss opportunities to empower individuals with SCI with regards to PA using tailored, context-aware communication.},

abstract = {We present StarLight, an infrastructure-based sensing system that reuses light emitted from ceiling LED panels to reconstruct fine-grained user skeleton postures continuously in real time. It relies on only a few (e.g., 20) photodiodes placed at optimized locations to passively capture low-level visual clues (light blockage information), with neither cameras capturing sensitive images, nor on-body devices, nor electromagnetic interference. It then aggregates the blockage information of a large number of light rays from LED panels and identifies best-fit 3D skeleton postures. StarLight greatly advances the prior light-based sensing design by dramatically reducing the number of intrusive sensors, overcoming furniture blockage, and supporting user mobility. We build and deploy StarLight in a 3.6 m x 4.8 m office room, with customized 20 LED panels and 20 photodiodes. Experiments show that StarLight achieves 13.6 degree mean angular error for five body joints and reconstructs a mobile skeleton at a high frame rate (40 FPS). StarLight enables a new unobtrusive sensing paradigm to augment today's mobile sensing for continuous and accurate behavioral monitoring.},

In Western countries (e.g. USA, UK, Australia), mental health issues are particularly prominent in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) individuals, yet they are disproportionately affected in relation to service provision. Despite demand, there is a significant lack of literature explicitly exploring the design of digital mental health tools for CALD populations. Our study engaged five professionals working in CALD mental health, to gain insights into challenges for service access and provision, and then engaged 41 CALD young people to explore their experiences. We contribute a set of unique insights into the barriers that CALD young people face when seeking help, and their needs for future digital mental health tools. We also provide design recommendations for future researchers on how they might better support the inclusion of CALD communities in the design of digital health tools.},

abstract = {Stress can lead to headaches and fatigue, precipitate addictive behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol and drug use), and lead to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Continuous assessment of stress from sensors can be used for timely delivery of a variety of interventions to reduce or avoid stress. We investigate the feasibility of continuous stress measurement via two field studies using wireless physiological sensors --- a four-week study with illicit drug users (n = 40), and a one-week study with daily smokers and social drinkers (n = 30). We find that 11+ hours/day of usable data can be obtained in a 4-week study. Significant learning effect is observed after the first week and data yield is seen to be increasing over time even in the fourth week. We propose a framework to analyze sensor data yield and find that losses in wireless channel is negligible; the main hurdle in further improving data yield is the attachment constraint. We show the feasibility of measuring stress minutes preceding events of interest and observe the sensor-derived stress to be rising prior to self-reported stress and smoking events.},

abstract = {With the advent of always-available, ubiquitous devices with powerful passive sensing and active interaction capabilities, the opportunities to integrate AI into this ecosystem have matured, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand and support user well-being. A wide array of research has demonstrated the potential to detect risky behaviors and address health concerns, using human-centered ML to understand longitudinal, passive behavior logs. Unfortunately, it is difficult to translate these findings into deployable applications without better approaches to providing human-understandable relationship explanations between behavior features and predictions; and generalizing to new users and new time periods. My past work has made significant headway in addressing modeling accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Moreover, my ultimate goal is to build deployable, intelligent interventions for health and well-being that make use of succeeding ML-based behavior models. I believe that just-in-time interventions are particularly well suited to ML support. I plan to test the value of ML for providing users with a better, interpretable, and robust experience in supporting their well-being.},

abstract = {Drug addiction is a chronic brain-based disorder that affects a person's behavior and leads to an inability to control drug usage. Ubiquitous physiological sensing technologies to detect illicit drug use have been well studied and understood for different types of drugs. However, we currently lack the ability to continuously and passively measure the user state in ways that might shed light on the complex relationships between cocaine-induced subjective states (e.g., craving and euphoria) and compulsive drug-seeking behavior. More specifically, the applicability of wearable sensors to detect drug-related states is underexplored. In the current work, we take an initial step in the modeling of cocaine craving, euphoria and drug-seeking behavior using electrocardiographic (ECG) and respiratory signals unobtrusively collected from a wearable chest band. Ten experienced cocaine users were studied using a human laboratory paradigm of self-regulated (i.e., "binge") cocaine administration, during which self-reported visual analog scale (VAS) ratings of cocaine-induced subjective effects (i.e., craving and euphoria) and behavioral measures of drug-seeking behavior (i.e., button clicks for drug infusions) are collected. Our results are encouraging and show that self-reported VAS Craving scores are predicted with a normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) of 17.6% and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.49. Similarly, for VAS Euphoria prediction, an NRMSE of 16.7% and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73 were achieved. We further analyze the relative importance of different morphology-related ECG and respiratory features for craving and euphoria prediction. Demographic factor analysis reveals how one single factor (i.e., average dollar ($) per cocaine use) can help to further boost the performance of our craving and euphoria models. Lastly, we model drug-seeking behavior using cardiac and respiratory signals. Specifically, we demonstrate that the latter signals can predict participant button clicks with an F1 score of 0.80 and estimate different levels of click density with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and an NRMSE of 17.9%.},

abstract = {Misinformation poses a recurrent challenge for video-sharing platforms (VSPs) like TikTok. Obtaining user perspectives on digital interventions addressing the need for transparency (e.g., through indicators) is essential. This article offers a thorough examination of the comprehensibility, usefulness, and limitations of an indicator-based intervention from an adolescents’ perspective. This study (N = 39; aged 13-16 years) comprised two qualitative steps: (1) focus group discussions and (2) think-aloud sessions, where participants engaged with a smartphone-app for TikTok. The results offer new insights into how video-based indicators can assist adolescents’ assessments. The intervention received positive feedback, especially for its transparency, and could be applicable to new content. This paper sheds light on how adolescents are expected to be experts while also being prone to video-based misinformation, with limited understanding of an intervention’s limitations. By adopting teenagers’ perspectives, we contribute to HCI research and provide new insights into the chances and limitations of interventions for VSPs.},

Reservations on throughput, the standard measure of disk performance, fail to effectively manage disk performance due to the orders of magnitude difference between best-, average-, and worst-case response times, allowing reservation of less than 0.01% of the achievable bandwidth. We show that by reserving disk resources in terms of utilization it is possible to create a disk scheduler that supports reservation of nearly 100% of the disk resources, provides arbitrarily hard or soft guarantees depending upon application needs, and yields efficiency as good or better than best-effort disk schedulers tuned for performance. We present the architecture of our scheduler, prove the correctness of its algorithms, and provide results demonstrating its effectiveness.},

The success of such JITIs critically depends on being able to mine the time series of noisy sensor data to find the most opportune moments. In this paper, we propose a time series pattern mining method to detect significant stress episodes in a time series of discontinuous and rapidly varying stress data. We apply our model to 4 weeks of physiological, GPS, and activity data collected from 38 users in their natural environment to discover patterns of stress in real life. We find that the duration of a prior stress episode predicts the duration of the next stress episode and stress in mornings and evenings is lower than during the day. We then analyze the relationship between stress and objectively rated disorder in the surrounding neighborhood and develop a model to predict stressful episodes.},

abstract = {Recent developments of novel in-vehicle interventions show the potential to transform the otherwise routine and mundane task of commuting into opportunities to improve the drivers' health and well-being. Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions.To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that "negated" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such "negative" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers.},

abstract = {Tailoring apps based on user traits has attracted tremendous interest in developing mHealth apps and understanding a users’ personality is a key challenge in that context. This challenge is typically addressed via classic surveys, which pose a regrettably high burden on app users. This study aims to reduce the response burden of personality tests by introducing a model for predicting the user personality based on digital footprints of app usage. At the same time, skipping surveys completely turns out to undermine prediction accuracy. Therefore, this paper conceptualizes a hybrid framework that utilizes user event data in combination with surveys that have fewer questions than conventionally. The proposed method demonstrates a promising trade-off between the simplicity of using user event data and the accuracy of the validated survey methods: when applying the hybrid method to a retrospective case study, the accuracy is higher than when using the event data exclusively. Also, the number of survey questions needed is significantly lower. Since this is a novel method, we expect that results will strengthen as larger data sets available over time.},

abstract = {The process of reading has attracted decades of scientific research. Work in this field primarily focuses on using eye gaze patterns to reveal cognitive processes while reading. However, eye gaze patterns suffer from limited resolution, jitter noise, and cognitive biases, resulting in limited accuracy in tracking cognitive reading states. Moreover, using sequential eye gaze data alone neglects the linguistic structure of text, undermining attempts to provide semantic explanations for cognitive states during reading. Motivated by the impact of the semantic context of text on the human cognitive reading process, this work uses both the semantic context of text and visual attention during reading to more accurately predict the temporal sequence of cognitive states. To this end, we present a Cognition-Aware Smart Eyewear System (CASES), which fuses semantic context and visual attention patterns during reading. The two feature modalities are time-aligned and fed to a temporal convolutional network based multi-task classification deep model to automatically estimate and further semantically explain the reading state timeseries. CASES is implemented in eyewear and its use does not interrupt the reading process, thus reducing subjective bias. Furthermore, the real-time association between visual and semantic information enables the interactions between visual attention and semantic context to be better interpreted and explained. Ablation studies with 25 subjects demonstrate that CASES improves multi-label reading state estimation accuracy by 20.90% for sentence compared to eye tracking alone. Using CASES, we develop an interactive reading assistance system. Three and a half months of deployment with 13 in-field studies enables several observations relevant to the study of reading. In particular, observed how individual visual history interacts with the semantic context at different text granularities. Furthermore, CASES enables just-in-time intervention when readers encounter processing difficulties, thus promoting self-awareness of the cognitive process involved in reading and helping to develop more effective reading habits.},

This paper is among the first to automatically personalize social comparison targets. In the context of an m-health app for physical activity, we use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of multi-armed bandits. Results from our user study (n=53) indicate that there is some evidence that motivation can be increased using the AI-based personalization of social comparison. The detected effects achieved small-to-moderate effect sizes, illustrating the real-world implications of the intervention for enhancing motivation and physical activity. In addition to design implications for social comparison features in social apps, this paper identified the personalization paradox, the conflict between user modeling and adaptation, as a key design challenge of personalized applications for behavior change. Additionally, we propose research directions to mitigate this Personalization Paradox.},

abstract = {Digital intervention tools against problematic smartphone usage help users control their consumption on smartphones, for example, by setting a time limit on an app. However, today's social media apps offer a mix of quasiessential and addictive features in an app (e.g., Instagram has following feeds, recommended feeds, stories, and direct messaging features), which makes it hard to apply a uniform logic for all uses of an app without a nuanced understanding of feature-level usage behaviors. We study when and why people regret using different features of social media apps on smartphones. We examine regretful feature uses in four smartphone social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and KakaoTalk) by utilizing feature usage logs, ESM surveys on regretful use collected for a week, and retrospective interviews from 29 Android users. In determining whether a feature use is regretful, users considered different types of rewards they obtained from using a certain feature (i.e., social, informational, personal interests, and entertainment) as well as alternative rewards they could have gained had they not used the smartphone (e.g., productivity). Depending on the types of rewards and the way rewards are presented to users, probabilities to regret vary across features of the same app. We highlight three patterns of features with different characteristics that lead to regretful use. First, "following"-based features (e.g., Facebook's News Feed and Instagram's Following Posts and Stories) induce habitual checking and quickly deplete rewards from app use. Second, recommendation-based features situated close to actively used features (e.g., Instagram's Suggested Posts adjacent to Search) cause habitual feature tour and sidetracking from the original intention of app use. Third, recommendation-based features with bite-sized contents (e.g., Facebook's Watch Videos) induce using "just a bit more," making people fall into prolonged use. We discuss implications of our findings for how social media apps and intervention tools can be designed to reduce regretful use and how feature-level usage information can strengthen self-reflection and behavior changes.},

We show that for detecting rare daily events such as toothbrushing, adopting a model that is based on identifying candidate windows based on events, rather than fixed-length timeblocks, leads to significantly higher performance. Trained and tested on 2,797 hours of sensor data collected over 192 days on 25 participants (using video annotations for ground truth labels), our brushing model achieves 100% median recall with a false positive rate of one event in every nine days of sensor wearing. The average error in estimating the start/end times of the detected event is 4.1% of the interval of the actual toothbrushing event.},

abstract = {Digital overuse on mobile devices is a growing problem in everyday life. This paper describes a generalizable mobile intervention that combines nudge theory and negative reinforcement to create a subtle, repeating phone vibration that nudges a user to reduce their digital consumption. For example, if a user has a daily Facebook limit of 30 minutes but opens Facebook past this limit, the user's phone will issue gentle vibrations every five seconds, but the vibration stops once the user navigates away from Facebook. We evaluated the intervention through a three-week controlled experiment with 50 participants on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform with findings that show daily digital consumption was successfully reduced by over 20%. Although the reduction did not persist after the intervention was removed, insights from qualitative feedback suggest that the intervention made participants more aware of their app usage habits; and we discuss design implications of episodically applying our intervention in specific everyday contexts such as education, sleep, and work. Taken together, our findings advance the HCI community's understanding of how to curb digital overload.},

abstract = {User-driven intervention tools such as self-tracking help users to self-regulate problematic smartphone usage. These tools basically assume active user engagement, but prior studies warned a lack of user engagement over time. This paper proposes GoldenTime, a mobile app that promotes self-regulated usage behavior via system-driven proactive timeboxing and micro-financial incentives framed as gain or loss for behavioral reinforcement. We conducted a large-scale user study (n = 210) to explore how our proactive timeboxing and micro-financial incentives influence users’ smartphone usage behaviors. Our findings show that GoldenTime’s timeboxing based micro-financial incentives are effective in self-regulating smartphone usage, and incentive framing has a significant impact on user behavior. We provide practical design guidelines for persuasive technology design related to promoting digital wellbeing.},

abstract = {Teamness is a newly proposed multidimensional construct aimed to characterize teams and their dynamic levels of interdependence over time. Specifically, teamness is deeply rooted in team cognition literature, considering how a team’s composition, processes, states, and actions affect collaboration. With this multifaceted construct being recently proposed, there is a call to the research community to investigate, measure, and model dimensions of teamness. In this study, we explored the speech content of 21 human-human-agent teams during a remote collaborative search task. Using self-report surveys of their social and affective states throughout the task, we conducted factor analysis to condense the survey measures into four components closely aligned with the dimensions outlined in the teamness framework: social dynamics and trust, affect, cognitive load, and interpersonal reliance. We then extracted features from teams’ speech using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and performed Epistemic Network Analyses (ENA) across these four teamwork components as well as team performance. We developed six hypotheses of how we expected specific LIWC features to correlate with self-reported team processes and performance, which we investigated through our ENA analyses. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses of the networks, we explore differences of speech patterns across the four components and relate these findings to the dimensions of teamness. Our results indicate that ENA models based on selected LIWC features were able to capture elements of teamness as well as team performance; this technique therefore shows promise for modeling of these states during CSCW, to ultimately design intelligent systems to promote greater teamness using speech-based measures.},

abstract = {The experience of what we eat depends not only on the taste of the food, but also on other modalities of sensory feedback. Perceptual research has shown the potential of altering visual, olfactory, and textural food cues to affect flavor, texture, and satiety. Recently, the HCI community has leveraged such research to encourage healthy eating, but the resulting tools often require specialised and/or invasive devices. Ubiquitous and unobtrusive, audio feedback-based tools could alleviate those drawbacks, but research in this area has been limited to food texture. We expand on prior psychology research by exploring a wide range of auditory feedback styles to modify not only flavor attributes but also appetite-related measures. We present Auditory Seasoning, a mobile app that offers various curated audio modes to alter chewing sounds. In a Pringles-tasting experiment (N=37), this tool significantly influenced food perception and eating behavior beyond texture alone. Based on these results, we discuss design implications to create custom real-world flavor/satiety-enhancing tools.},

abstract = {The complex interplay between wildlife conservation and community support in areas prone to human-wildlife conflicts, particularly livestock depredation, poses challenges to effective conservation efforts. This study explores the potential of digital governance tools to address these challenges, focusing on the acceptance and feasibility of such technologies in tiger reserve areas. The research objectives include assessing community willingness to adopt digital platforms for reporting wildlife incidents, exploring perceived benefits and concerns, and proposing strategies to overcome barriers for effective integration. Digital governance tools offer innovative solutions by enabling real-time data collection, conflict monitoring, and community engagement. However, challenges arise due to socio-economic factors, limited technology access, and low digital literacy in local populations. Capacity-building programs are identified as crucial for empowering communities, reducing reliance on forest officials, and fostering sustainable cohabitation.The research, conducted in the Panna Tiger Reserve in India, employs a two-phase approach. The first phase involves a survey of 150 households to gauge community knowledge, attitudes, and accessibility to digital platforms. The second phase includes a workshop where participants perform tasks related to compensation processes using mobile applications. Results indicate a positive willingness to adopt digital platforms, particularly among the younger population. Demographic analysis reveals the educational and economic profile of the sample population, emphasizing the need for tailored capacity-building programs. Workshop data analysis demonstrates initial challenges but highlights the potential for improved performance and acceptance through education.The study identifies concerns in technological accessibility, digital literacy, language barriers, data privacy, socio-economic factors, and cultural appropriateness. Recommendations include enhancing digital infrastructure, fostering digital literacy through community programs, ensuring language and cultural inclusivity in platform design, addressing privacy concerns, and promoting community engagement. In conclusion, the successful integration of digital governance in wildlife conservation requires a multifaceted approach, including infrastructure improvement, education, cultural sensitivity, and economic accessibility. The study provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of implementing digital solutions, emphasizing the importance of community involvement for sustainable conservation practices.},

Given the number of commuters who spend a substantial amount of time on the road, the car offers an opportune environment. This paper presents the first in-vehicle intervention study affecting mental health and well-being on public roads. We designed and implemented two in-vehicle interventions based on proven psychotherapy interventions. Whereas the first intervention uses mindfulness exercises while driving, the second intervention induces positive emotions through music. Ten ordinary and healthy commuters completed 313 of these interventions on their daily drives over two months. We collected drivers’ immediate and post-driving feedback for each intervention and conducted interviews with the drivers after the end of the study. The results show that both interventions have improved drivers’ well-being. While the participants rated the music intervention very positively, the reception of the mindfulness intervention was more ambivalent.},

In this paper, we propose a new model and evaluate its performance on 61 newly abstinent smokers for detecting a first lapse. We use two wearable sensors --- breathing pattern from respiration and arm movements from 6-axis inertial sensors worn on wrists. In 10-fold cross-validation on 40 hours of training data from 6 daily smokers, our model achieves a recall rate of 96.9%, for a false positive rate of 1.1%. When our model is applied to 3 days of post-quit data from 32 lapsers, it correctly pinpoints the timing of first lapse in 28 participants. Only 2 false episodes are detected on 20 abstinent days of these participants. When tested on 84 abstinent days from 28 abstainers, the false episode per day is limited to 1/6.},

I am directly motivated by the recognition that digital health interventions can support better health outcomes yet are often poorly fit to context and culture, overengineered with good intentions, and lack measurable impact. This work explores developing a critical reflexive practice to support global health practitioners in critiquing their vantage points, assumptions, and decisions. The idea is that cultivating this practice at individual, community and institutional levels can spark change through more epistemologically diverse designs and implementations of global health interventions, and more specifically for digital health interventions.},

As contemporary education campaigns and current mHealth solutions only reach health literate users, an often unaffected minority, there exists demand for more inclusive solutions. Avatar-based health interventions have been shown effective in such a context, but have not been tested for promoting low-sodium dieting specifically. Therefore, we designed, implemented and tested a novel smartphone-mediated and future-self avatar-based sodium reduction intervention (N = 28). Because most consumers remain unaware of the relationship between sodium intake and high blood pressure, the system was also tailored to support users in gaining risk awareness and intention for low-sodium dieting. Results indicate that participants significantly increase outcome expectancy, risk awareness and intention towards balanced, low-sodium dieting. The majority of users identify themselves with the future-self avatar and confirm the system's usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment.},

abstract = {Driving behaviour is key to determining the safety of individuals on the road. It can be argued that understanding driving behaviour and developing methods to improve it will lead to a decrease in accidents and improve citizen safety. At present, most of the work associated with driving behaviour is carried out by insurance companies who use mobile apps and telematic sensors to monitor driving behaviours. These companies are, mainly, capturing driving data to calculate annual premiums rather than to share that data with the drivers. On the academic side, the work focuses on feedback approach and real-time warnings systems. Both commercial and academic research does not consider the significant fact that all drivers are not the same; one-size-fits-all" will not work.This research investigates the scope of personalisation by factors such as age, gender, culture, country and type of driving (e.g. rural or urban) and its impact on driver behaviour. The aim is to improve the effectiveness of driving behaviours systems which can produce meaningful feedback to the driver. Our model suggests that through personalisation, user-modelling and persuasive techniques such as regular feedback reports to drivers (showing their bad driving behaviour), it is possible to improve driving styles and eventually create improved driving behaviour systems. Another positive outcome of this model will be safer roads. We have conducted surveys, used focus groups and interviews to find out the types of driver and their preferences.},

This concept, understood as a tool to retrieve data on the users' state, including information about their own perception on their health, is unveiling as a powerful instrument to better understand patients with mental disorders for scientific and clinical goals, but also to provide personalized coaching and support that may facilitate disease detection, monitoring and treatment. In this paper, we review previous works on digital phenotyping for mental health care, through a framework that facilitates the description of relevant studies. We propose a general architecture for digital phenotyping platforms from the main key functionalities that have been identified and analyze the main barriers and needs to be overcome to exploit data in a patient-centric way. In particular, there is a requirement for extensive user validation, as existing studies are still very preliminary and, as a consequence, it is also key to explore the integration of digital phenotyping mhealth solutions as cornerstone tools for integrated care delivery.},

abstract = {High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in AI, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning (ML) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.},

abstract = {Timely, personalized feedback is essential for students learning programming. LLM-powered tools like ChatGPT offer instant support, but reveal direct answers with code, which may hinder deep conceptual engagement. We developed CodeAid, an LLM-powered programming assistant delivering helpful, technically correct responses, without revealing code solutions. CodeAid answers conceptual questions, generates pseudo-code with line-by-line explanations, and annotates student’s incorrect code with fix suggestions. We deployed CodeAid in a programming class of 700 students for a 12-week semester. A thematic analysis of 8,000 usages of CodeAid was performed, further enriched by weekly surveys, and 22 student interviews. We then interviewed eight programming educators to gain further insights. Our findings reveal four design considerations for future educational AI assistants: D1) exploiting AI’s unique benefits; D2) simplifying query formulation while promoting cognitive engagement; D3) avoiding direct responses while encouraging motivated learning; and D4) maintaining transparency and control for students to asses and steer AI responses.},

abstract = {Churches play a major role in providing social support to address health inequities within Black communities, in part by connecting members to key organizations and services. While public health has a history of disseminating interventions in faith communities, little work has explored the use of crowdsourcing to tailor interventions to the unique culture of each church community. Following Community Based Participatory Research principles, we partnered with two predominantly Black churches, and report on a series of three participatory design sessions with nine participants. We developed a novel storyboarding method to explore how crowdsourcing could promote health in these faith-based communities. Our findings characterize existing supports within the church community, and how church social structures impact member access to these supports. We further identify motivations to engage with a church-situated health application, and how these motivations translate to crowdsourcing tasks. Finally, we discuss considerations for public health crowdsourcing tasks.},

abstract = {Mental health difficulties are highly prevalent among young people. Despite this, research shows that many young people do not seek help for mental health difficulties. In this paper, we explore the experiences of students who have accessed mental health support services in Ireland. Their experiences highlight the barriers students face while accessing mental health support. We found that students lack access to the necessary information to support their decision-making process when selecting a support service. For instance, how a service operates, what kind of support a service provides, the privacy policies, etc. Based on these identified needs, we designed a prototype of an application called Pathway. Pathway aims to address these barriers by providing students with mental health support services that fit their preferences. It also provides detailed information on mental health support services. This paper details the use of the eHealth development framework by the Center for eHealth Research and Disease Management towards the development of this application.},

Survivors of gynecological cancer often experience bodily changes, fear of cancer recurrence, and changes in sexual health. This paper explores how we can use audiovisual narratives based on experiences of gynecological cancer survival in the design of an online intervention. From a typology of cancer survival, we designed three audiovisual narratives in an experience-centered design process involving gynecological cancer survivors. The narratives were evaluated by 10 participants formerly treated for gynecological cancer. In a thematic analysis, we explore how these narratives set the stage for identification and reflection by being experienced as relatable, provoking, and realistic. Finally, we discuss how the survivors’ experience of the narratives can be construed as meaningful, and how accounts of experiences can be included in a design process to create narrative content for online interventions.},

abstract = {Tools that can help older adults self-manage multiple health goals in collaboration with their care managers are rare to find. Informed by the Self-Determination Theory, Goal-Oriented Care paradigm and our prior findings, we used an iterative, user-centered process to design a tablet application to facilitate Goal-Oriented care in community-dwelling low income older adults with chronic (multi)morbidity. A formative in-situ evaluation was conducted in which 20 participants used the app to set and track health and wellness goals for 24 weeks, while participants' interactions with the app were logged. At the end of the study, semi-structured interviews were administered to understand how the app was used. Thirteen participants used the app throughout the study, while the remaining abandoned after short usage. Thematic analysis of the qualitative feedback shows that participants who used the app increased their commitment towards their goals and adopted healthy behaviors. Health issues, time constraints, lack of technical know-how and doubts about goal-setting paradigm were identified as primary reasons for low app usage and abandonment. Tools for Goal-Oriented care should support personalized goal exploration, build trust in the care paradigm, support collaboration, design for motivation, lower barriers to tracking and support re-engagement after abandonment. Carefully designed mobile apps have the potential to support Goal-Oriented care for older adults.},

Behavioral researchers have begun adopting smartphones as data-collection tools in psychological and behavioral science because these devices can study people in their everyday life, objectively measure behavior (using mobile sensing), and implement interventions. From a literature review of recent research on mobile behavior change, we identify three design components: mobile sensing, user contexts, and digital nudges. Informed by these components, we designed three example mobile research applications and propose a solution-focused, conceptual framework for deploying behavior change studies using mobile phones. We discuss future directions for research in psychological and behavioral science as these fields embrace mobile technology.},

abstract = {Impaired social functioning is a symptom of mental illness (e.g., depression, schizophrenia) and a wide range of other conditions (e.g., cognitive decline in the elderly, dementia). Today, assessing social functioning relies on subjective evaluations and self assessments. We propose a different approach and collect detailed social functioning measures and objective mobile sensing data from N=55 outpatients living with schizophrenia to study new methods of passively accessing social functioning. We identify a number of behavioral patterns from sensing data, and discuss important correlations between social function sub-scales and mobile sensing features. We show we can accurately predict the social functioning of outpatients in our study including the following sub-scales: prosocial activities (MAE = 7.79, r = 0.53), which indicates engagement in common social activities; interpersonal behavior (MAE = 3.39, r = 0.57), which represents the number of friends and quality of communications; and employment/occupation (MAE = 2.17, r = 0.62), which relates to engagement in productive employment or a structured program of daily activity. Our work on automatically inferring social functioning opens the way to new forms of assessment and intervention across a number of areas including mental health and aging in place.},

However, what about smartphones? Despite the fact that these ubiquitous mobile devices now offer levels of hardware and performance approaching that of laptops, locally executed model-training using data mining methods on smartphones is still notably rare. On-device model-training offers a number of advantages. It largely mitigates issues of data security and privacy, since no data is required to leave the device. It also ensures a self-contained, fully portable data mining solution requiring no cloud computing or network resources and able to operate in any location. In this article, we focus on the intersection of smartphones and data mining. We investigate the growth in smartphone performance, survey smartphone usage models in previous research, and look at recent developments in locally executed data mining on smartphones.},

This solution goes significantly beyond existing monitoring and assisted living approaches, which operate with a simple set of sensors and measurements, as it integrates a very heterogeneous set of sensing modalities and technologies, including video, audio analysis, in addition to physiological, environmental and other measurements. Semantic web technologies are used in for the intelligent integration and feedback of the sensor analysis results, also in line with user requirements, dictated by clinicians. This results in relevant feedback and decision support, which is communicated to the end users via appropriately designed user interfaces. A variety of clinical scenarios and environments are supported, from short-duration testing in hospital environments to long-term daily life monitoring and support at home, for independent living.},

abstract = {Assessing students' learning of concepts in programming is an essential part of teaching computer science. We developed an assessment activity that measures students' skill in identifying programming structures used to create various behaviors in MIT App Inventor (AI). Called the Tablet Game, the assessment was implemented as interactive app on an Android device. Students interacted with elements on the screen, and then in a multiple-choice format, were asked to select which code-blocks would create those behaviors. We tested the Tablet Game in two week-long app development summer camps held with middle school students. Students completed the same assessment at the beginning and end of the week. Students also completed pre/post surveys which measured interest levels in computer science, gathered ethnographic data, and asked students to report on their prior programming experience. Each student's work on the Tablet Game was matched to that student's pre/post survey responses. Using data from 44 students, our results indicate that (1) students with high self-reported prior experience in App Inventor outperformed students with low prior experience on the Tablet Game pre-test, indicating that the assessment measures programming skill and (2) students with low prior experience matched the results of the high prior experience cohort in the post-test, indicating that the camp was successful in imparting AI programming skill. Both of these results are statistically significant. Further, (3) there were no statistically significant differences in the gender composition of the two experience cohorts, indicating that the camp was equally accessible to girls and boys.},

abstract = {With the rise of ever-more sophisticated wearables and sensing technologies, mobile health continues to be an active area of research. However, from a clinical researcher point of view, testing novel use of the mobile health innovations remains a major hurdle, as composing a clinical trial using a combination of technologies still remains in the realm of computer scientists. We take a software-inspired viewpoint of clinical trial designs to design, develop and validate HealthSense to enable expressibility of complex ideas, composability with diverse devices and services while maximally maintaining simplicity for a clinical research user. A key innovation in HealthSense is the concept of a study state manager (SSM) that modifies parameters of the study over time as data accumulates and can trigger external events that affect the participant; this design allows us to implement nearly arbitrary clinical trial designs. The SSM can funnel data streams to custom or third-party cloud processing pipelines and the result can be used to give interventions and modify parameters of the study. HealthSense supports both Android and iOS platforms and is secure, scalable and fully operational. We outline three trials (two with clinical populations) to highlight simplicity, composability, and expressibility of HealthSense.},

We analyze public data from users who have chosen to connect their MyFitnessPal and Twitter accounts. We show that a user's diet compliance success, measured via their self-logged food diaries, can be predicted using features derived from social media: linguistic, activity, and social capital. We find that users with more positive affect and a larger social network are more successful in succeeding in their dietary goals. Using a Granger causality methodology, we also show that social media can help predict daily changes in diet compliance success or failure with an accuracy of 77%, that improves over baseline techniques by 17%. We discuss the implications of our work in the design of improved health interventions for behavior change.},

With a collaboration between researchers, domain experts, interactive systems developers and professionals, this paper aims to fill this gap by systematically investigating 70 mHealth apps using two popular behaviour change frameworks, namely App Behaviour Change Scale (ABACUS) and the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model. The study investigates the most common strategies and how these strategies were designed and implemented in the apps to achieve the targeted design objectives. Furthermore, the study evaluates apps' behaviour change potential using the behaviour Change Score (BCS), a measure we introduced to evaluate how the apps employ behaviour change strategies. The results show that 1) Journaling is the most common category of apps. 2) the most employed strategies are Self-monitoring, Customize and Personalize, and Reminders. And 3) there is a positive correlation between apps' ranks (based on ratings and installation) and the BCS score of most strategies. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for designing and developing mHealth apps and present opportunities for future work in this area.},

abstract = {Patient-generated data, such as data from wearable fitness trackers and smartphone apps, are viewed as a valuable information source towards personalised healthcare. However, studies in specific clinical settings have revealed diverse barriers to their effective use. In this paper, we address the following question: are there barriers prevalent across distinct workflows in clinical settings to using patient-generated data? We conducted a two-part investigation: a literature review of studies identifying such barriers; and interviews with clinical specialists across multiple roles, including emergency care, cardiology, mental health, and general practice. We identify common barriers in a six-stage workflow model of aligning patient and clinician objectives, judging data quality, evaluating data utility, rearranging data into a clinical format, interpreting data, and deciding on a plan or action. This workflow establishes common ground for HCI practitioners and researchers to explore solutions to improving the use of patient-generated data in clinical practices.},

abstract = {Personal informatics (PI) systems are designed for diverse users in the real world. Even when these systems are usable, people encounter barriers while engaging with them in ways designers cannot anticipate, which impacts the system's effectiveness. Although PI literature extensively reports such barriers, the volume of this information can be overwhelming. Researchers and practitioners often find themselves repeatedly addressing the same challenges since sifting through this enormous volume of knowledge looking for relevant insights is often infeasible. We contribute to alleviating this issue by conducting a meta-synthesis of the PI literature and categorizing people's barriers and facilitators to engagement with PI systems into eight themes. Based on the synthesized knowledge, we discuss specific generalizable barriers and paths for further investigations. This synthesis can serve as an index to identify barriers pertinent to each application domain and possibly to identify barriers from one domain that might apply to a different domain. Finally, to ensure the sustainability of the syntheses, we propose a Design Statements (DS) block for research articles.},

abstract = {Bootstrapping activity recognition systems in ubiquitous and mobile computing scenarios often comes with the challenge of obtaining reliable ground truth annotations. A promising approach to overcome these difficulties involves obtaining online activity annotations directly from users. However, such direct engagement has its limitations as users typically show only limited tolerance for unwanted interruptions such as prompts for annotations. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of approaches to online, user-based annotation of activity data. Our central assumption is the existence of a fixed, limited budget of annotations a user is willing to provide. We evaluate different strategies on how to spend such a budget most effectively. Using the Opportunity benchmark we simulate online annotation scenarios for a variety of budget configurations and we show that effective online annotation can still be achieved using reduced annotation effort.},

abstract = {Continuous and effective monitoring of chronic diseases and their associated treatments might have a decisive impact on reducing risks and improving life quality of patients. This, however, demands new and innovative methods for engineering systems that support the required capabilities. Research on the application of the novel concept of Digital Twin (DT) in healthcare might provide the means to revolutionize traditional medical practices. A DT comprises a set of virtual representations of both the structural elements and dynamics of any physical asset (e.g., a patient) throughout its lifecycle. In the healthcare domain, it might represent a significan step forward towards tightening and improving the interactions between systems, caregivers and patients. Moreover, integrating data-driven methods (e.g., Machine Learning) and DT could serve as a noteworthy mechanism to not only track patients' health continuously, but also to evaluate the application and evolution of medical treatments virtually. In this paper, we describe our vision for the application of DT in precision medicine. Our contributions are twofold. First, we describe our initial ideas for a reference model that leverages DT capabilities and research advances in self-adaptive systems and autonomic computing to engineer smart and fl xible software systems in healthcare. We expect these systems to alleviate complexity and assist in the planning and decision-making processes when applying medical treatments to patients by healthcare professionals. Then, we elaborate on the definitio of internal structures for DT to support precision medicine techniques in the context of continuous monitoring and personalized data-driven medical treatments.},

The meditation, amongst many other relaxation techniques, is emerging as a popular practice for dealing with stress and anxiety. However, so far meditation and its effect on well-being have been mostly measured based on subjective feedback or in some cases in laboratory settings where bulky and expensive devices are used for capturing physiological data, therefore, unfit for daily life uses.

abstract = {The main aim of this position paper is to identify and briefly discuss design-related issues commonly encountered with the implementation of both behaviour change techniques and persuasive design principles in physical activity smartphone applications. These overlapping issues highlight a disconnect in the perspectives held between health scientists' focus on the application of behaviour change theories and components of interventions, and the information systems designers' focus on the application of persuasive design principles as software design features intended to motivate, facilitate and support individuals through the behaviour change process. A review of the current status and some examples of these different perspectives is presented, leading to the identification of the main issues associated with this disconnection. The main behaviour change technique issues identified are concerned with: the fragmented integration of techniques, hindrances in successful use, diversity of user needs and preferences, and the informational flow and presentation. The main persuasive design issues identified are associated with: the fragmented application of persuasive design principles, hindrances in successful usage, diversity of user needs and preferences, informational flow and presentation, the lack of pragmatic guidance for application designers, and the maintenance of immersive user interactions and engagements. Given the common overlap across four of the identified issues, it is concluded that a methodological approach for integrating these two perspectives, and their associated issues, into a consolidated framework is necessary to address the apparent disconnect between these two independently-established, yet complementary fields.},

abstract = {A person's emotional state can strongly influence their ability to achieve optimal task performance. Aiming to help individuals manage their feelings, different emotion regulation technologies have been proposed. However, despite the well-known influence that emotions have on task performance, no study to date has shown if an emotion regulation technology can also enhance user's cognitive performance in the moment. In this paper, we present BoostMeUp, a smartwatch intervention designed to improve user's cognitive performance by regulating their emotions unobtrusively. Based on studies that show that people tend to associate external signals that resemble heart rates as their own, the intervention provides personalized haptic feedback simulating a different heart rate. Users can focus on their tasks and the intervention acts upon them in parallel, without requiring any additional action. The intervention was evaluated in an experiment with 72 participants, in which they had to do math tests under high pressure. Participants who were exposed to slow haptic feedback during the tests decreased their anxiety, increased their heart rate variability and performed better in the math tests, while fast haptic feedback led to the opposite effects. These results indicate that the BoostMeUp intervention can lead to positive cognitive, physiological and behavioral changes.},

Here, two mobile self-reported dietary assessment methods were compared (4-hour Recall vs. Food Record) to monitor food intake for WfH. A within-subject study involving 30 participants was conducted over a 4-week period. We assessed the workload and acceptance of these two methods using questionnaires and follow-up interviews. Results of questionnaires revealed that most participants presented high acceptance of Food Record related to a more flexible completion time and lower mental burden. Based on interviews, we presented a set of design insights to promote WfH healthy eating, including integrating reminders into daily routines, simplifying the tracking process, and adding gaming elements. Then, we discussed design implications, including integrating digital tools into daily routines and designing simple and playful using processes, to promote healthy eating during the WfH period.},

Most research emphasizes improvements in the accuracy of affect measurement to enhance instructors' efficiency in managing large numbers of students. However, these technologies are not designed from students' perspectives, nor designed for students' own usage. To identify the unique design considerations for affect sensors that consider student capacities and challenges, and explore the potential of affect sensors to support students' self-learning, we conducted semi-structured interviews and surveys with both online students and on-campus students enrolled in large in-person classes. Drawing on these studies we: (a) propose using affect data to support students' self-regulated learning behaviors through a "scaling for empowerment'' design perspective, (b) identify design guidelines to mitigate students' concerns regarding the use of affect data at scale, (c) provide design recommendations for the physical design of affect sensors for large educational settings.},

It combines state-of-the-art behavior tracking with algorithms that are used in recommendation systems. MyBehavior automatically learns a user's physical activity and dietary behavior and strategically suggests changes to those behaviors for a healthier lifestyle. The system uses a sequential decision making algorithm, Multi-armed Bandit, to generate suggestions that maximize calorie loss and are easy for the user to adopt. In addition, the system takes into account user's preferences to encourage adoption using the pareto-frontier algorithm. In a 14-week study, results show statistically significant increases in physical activity and decreases in food calorie when using MyBehavior compared to a control condition.},

While the prevalence of GenAI in education has motivated numerous research initiatives, integrating these technologies within the learning analytics (LA) cycle and their implications for practical interventions remain underexplored. This paper delves into the prospective opportunities and challenges GenAI poses for advancing LA. We present a concise overview of the current GenAI landscape and contextualise its potential roles within Clow’s generic framework of the LA cycle. We posit that GenAI can play pivotal roles in analysing unstructured data, generating synthetic learner data, enriching multimodal learner interactions, advancing interactive and explanatory analytics, and facilitating personalisation and adaptive interventions. As the lines blur between learners and GenAI tools, a renewed understanding of learners is needed. Future research can delve deep into frameworks and methodologies that advocate for human-AI collaboration. The LA community can play a pivotal role in capturing data about human and AI contributions and exploring how they can collaborate most effectively. As LA advances, it is essential to consider the pedagogical implications and broader socioeconomic impact of GenAI for ensuring an inclusive future.},

abstract = {The menopause transition is associated with physiological changes that increase women's cardiovascular and metabolic risk. Healthier and more conscious behavior in specific areas (diet, physical activity, smoking, etc.) can mitigate this risk. However, in order to modify such behavior, women must be aware of the need to use endogenous and exogenous strategies to improve their lifestyle habits. Despite the explosion of health-related apps, there are currently no innovative examples addressing a self-care approach to menopause by applying personalization, adaptability, and persuasion to induce women to improve their health-related lifestyle. Therefore, this paper describes the theoretical foundations and design phases of a system that coaches women to improve their lifestyle during menopause. To this end, we used a Participatory Design approach involving different groups of women along the different design phases to define the system's user interfaces and interaction mechanisms.},

However, these systems need to be able to learn new activities to adapt to a user's needs. Learning new activities is especially challenging in practical scenarios when a user provides only a few annotations for training an AR model. In this work, we study the problem of recognizing new activities with a limited amount of labeled training data. Due to the shortage of labeled data, small variations of the new activity will not be detected resulting in a significant degradation of the system's recall. We propose the FE-AT (Feature-based and Attribute-based learning) approach, which leverages the relationship between existing and new activities to compensate for the shortage of the labeled data. We evaluate FE-AT on three public datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms traditional AR approaches in recognizing new activities, especially when only a few training instances are available.},

abstract = {Mobile health (mHealth) applications have the potential to improve healthcare services, lessen the burden on hospitals, and enhance the experience of quality of life.&nbsp; Mobile health applications are designed without considering the patient characteristics of their population. There are some issues in the adoption of mHealth applications among older people, such as problems in login, difficulty in navigation, inappropriate guidance, cumbersome data updation, and privacy issues. In this article, critical success factors are identified for the adoption of health-related IT services in older people. For understanding end-user barriers, it is necessary to understand the user's context and demographic information. A usability questionnaire was devised to get information about users, their demographics, and critical success factors for the adoption of mobile health applications. The questionnaire has responses in form of ordinal data, so nonparametric statistical tests are performed and the spearman correlation coefficient (r) is calculated to understand the role of each critical success factor in task performance. This research has evaluated nine success factors and their impact on elder people in the usage of diabetic health applications.&nbsp; Only four critical success factors were found strongly correlated with task performance i.e., information flow, ease of data entry, regular guidance, and usefulness. The research also identified that poor usability is a primary reason for discontinuing the use of mHealth applications among older people.},

Security attacks by malicious software running on smart phones can obtain in-band and out-of-band sound information to infer the content of users' conversation. In this paper, we propose two simple yet highly effective methods called {em sound shredding} and {em sound subsampling}. Sound shredding mutates the raw sound frames randomly just like paper shredding and sound subsampling randomly drops sound frames without storing them. The resulting mutated sound recording makes it difficult to recover the text content of the original sound recording, yet we show that some acoustic features are preserved which retains the accuracy of context recognition.},

abstract = {In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used in modern electronic health record (EHR) systems, and have shown more accurate prediction performance on disease risk assessment tasks than traditional methods. However, most of the existing machine learning methods make the assessment solely based on features of the target case but ignore the cross-sample feature interactions between the target case and other similar cases, which is inconsistent with the general practice of evidence-based medicine of making diagnoses based on existing clinical experience. Moreover, current methods that focus on mining cross-sample information rely on deep neural networks to extract cross-sample feature interactions, which would suffer from the problems of data insufficiency, data heterogeneity and lack of interpretability in disease risk assessment tasks. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-based gradient boosting decision trees (RB-GBDT) model with a cross-sample extractor to mine cross-sample information while exploiting the superiority of GBDT of robustness, generalization and interpretability. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show the superiority and efficacy of RB-GBDT on disease risk assessment tasks. The developed software has been deployed in hospital as an auxiliary diagnosis tool for risk assessment of venous thromboembolism.},

abstract = {Social interaction is a crucial part of what it means to be human. Maintaining a healthy social life is strongly tied to positive outcomes for both physical and mental health. While we use personal informatics data to reflect on many aspects of our lives, technology-supported reflection for social interactions is currently under-explored. To address this, we first conducted an online survey (N=124) to understand how users want to be supported in their social interactions. Based on this, we designed and developed an app for users to track and reflect on their social interactions and deployed it in the wild for two weeks (N=25). Our results show that users are interested in tracking meaningful in-person interactions that are currently untraced and that an app can effectively support self-reflection on social interaction frequency and social load. We contribute insights and concrete design recommendations for technology-supported reflection for social interaction.},

Leveraging technology to integrate such interventions into the workday may address these barriers and help mitigate the mental, physical, and monetary effects of workplace stress. To inform the design of a workplace stress-reduction intervention system, we conducted a four-week longitudinal study with 86 participants, examining the effects of intervention type and timing on usage, stress reduction impact, and user preferences. We compared three intervention types and two delivery timing conditions: Pre-scheduled (PS) by users and Just-in-time (JIT) prompted by the system-identified user stress-levels. We found JIT participants completed significantly more interventions than PS participants, but post-intervention and study-long stress reduction was not significantly different between conditions. Participants rated low-effort interventions highest, but high-effort interventions reduced the most stress. Participants felt JIT provided accountability but desired partial agency over timing. We present type and timing implications.},

abstract = {Various automated eating detection wearables have been proposed to monitor food intakes. While these systems overcome the forgetfulness of manual user journaling, they typically show low accuracy at outside-the-lab environments or have intrusive form-factors (e.g., headgear). Eyeglasses are emerging as a socially-acceptable eating detection wearable, but existing approaches require custom-built frames and consume large power. We propose MyDJ, an eating detection system that could be attached to any eyeglass frame. MyDJ achieves accurate and energy-efficient eating detection by capturing complementary chewing signals on a piezoelectric sensor and an accelerometer. We evaluated the accuracy and wearability of MyDJ with 30 subjects in uncontrolled environments, where six subjects attached MyDJ on their own eyeglasses for a week. Our study shows that MyDJ achieves 0.919 F1-score in eating episode coverage, with 4.03 \texttimes{} battery time over the state-of-the-art systems. In addition, participants reported wearing MyDJ was almost as comfortable (94.95%) as wearing regular eyeglasses.},

Two focus groups and three design workshops were held in 2016, involving 10 adults with DS and their caregivers. Based on the data collected, as well as feedback from a multi-disciplinary team of computer scientists, medical doctors, geneticists, neuropsychologists, and dietitians, a conceptual design was created that detailed key features and areas of concern. Implications for user-centered design, interface designers, and dietitians are presented in this article as well.},

Feedback tools are needed to help providers identify and learn from their biases. To incorporate providers’ perspectives on the most effective ways to present such feedback, we conducted semi-structured design critique sessions with 24 primary care providers. We found that providers seek feedback designed with transparent metrics indicating the quality of their communication with a patient and trends in communication patterns across visits. Based on these metrics and trends, providers want this feedback presented in a dashboard paired with actionable, personalized tips about how to improve their communication behaviors. Our study provides new insights for interactive systems to help mitigate the impact of implicit biases in patient-provider communication. New systems that build upon these insights could support providers in making healthcare more equitable, particularly for patients from marginalized communities.},

abstract = {Nowadays, most people care about their personal health, no matter mental or physical health in their daily life. They sustain and improve their health status with exercise, diet control, adopt good sleep habit, keep natural patterns on sleeping and bowel movement. These people need a tool for monitor and record long-termly their own health status. On the other hand, some people do not see they need to change their health related lifestyle to improve their health status until they are diagnosed with diseases. While he/she is sick, he/she also need to write down their health diary he/herself or the caregiver (most of them are the disadvantaged in their family) for the physician to monitor the illness.In this paper we proposed a social network service named HowCare, a caregiver based social support online community, with a personal health cloud archive and its unique designs with "HealthRank" algorithm to match caregiver's social network with correlated illness situation they face to.The aim of HowCare are, to help people keep their own health data on the cloud and allows patients or caregiver with the same disease to interact with each other, and through the social network and telehealth design, it will influence the patient's willingness to accept healthier life and improve health status},

We prototyped a support system called SoberMotion, in which a breathalyzer is connected to the offender's smart phone via Bluetooth. Development of the system was based on pilot interviews with probation officers, psychiatrists, and offenders aimed at identifying the challenges and opportunities associated with this type of technology-based support mechanism. A corresponding phone app logs alcohol use behavior and identifies situations in which offenders should evaluate their sobriety before operating a vehicle. We conducted a two-month field study involving eight DUI offenders on probation, with the aim of evaluating the feasibility of the SoberMotion system. Our results indicate that most of the participants who drank alcohol while following the program performed multiple alcohol screening tests before operating a vehicle in order to avoid re-committing DUI. Responses collected via qualitative interviews indicate that SoberMotion is an effective approach to extending the power of probation officers seeking to reduce the risk of DUI recidivism.},

This paper presents the design and development of a smart monitoring system called "MindTrack" aimed at addressing the long-term treatment and monitoring challenges of depression. MindTrack is composed of smart wearable devices integrated with a real-time monitoring desktop application. It passively monitors patients’ behavioral and physiological data, enabling an objective assessment of depressive symptoms. The proposed architecture combines Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and WiFi-HaLoW (IEEE 802.11ah) protocols for efficient data transmission, edge computing and cloud connectivity incorporation for storage and analysis, various sensor utilization in the perception layer to track the patient's well-being and includes a patient-oriented smart wearable device operating system (OS) and a desktop application for psychologists to monitor and aid in treatment planning. None of the existing studies utilized a comprehensive combination of sensors specifically tailored for monitoring patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Moreover, there's limited focus on efficient power resources and security risk management. Hence, this paper proposes Mindtrack as a reliable and usable solution for improving specialized mental health care and addressing the challenges associated with MDD treatment and monitoring.},

This interest stems in part from increased recognition that the ability to regulate emotions is critical to mental health, and that a lack of effective emotion regulation is a transdiagnostic factor for mental illness. However, the potential to combine innovative HCI designs with the theoretical grounding and state-of-the-art interventions from psychology has yet to be fully realised. In this article, we synthesise HCI work on emotion regulation interventions and propose a three-part framework to guide technology designers in making: (i) theory-informed decisions about intervention targets; (ii) strategic decisions regarding the technology-enabled intervention mechanisms to be included in the system; and (iii) practical decisions around previous implementations of the selected intervention components. We show how this framework can both systematise HCI work to date and suggest a research agenda for future work.},

The dynamics of participation are influenced by various factors, both internal and external. While prior research has primarily concentrated on citizens’ participatory behavior and government responses, this study aims to address the research gap by exploring the characteristics of issues that citizens may consider before their participation. Using a 3X2 survey experiment design, we collected 708 questionnaires through the online survey platform Credamo in China. The findings reveal that a higher level of issues’ urgency significantly enhances citizens’ willingness to report. In contrast, the publicness and sensitivity of an issue serve as dampeners to the probability of submitting a request to governments. This paper contributes to the e-participation literature, suggesting that the characteristics of issues themselves play a crucial role in shaping e-participation behaviors. By providing insights into how different issue characteristics influence e-participation willingness, this paper also offers practical evidence toward nurturing more vibrant and inclusive digital public spaces, fostering better citizen-government connections in the digital age.},

In this paper we outline affective computing projects and in the workshop will discuss challenges of designing interventions to promote positive behaviors in real world environments.},

abstract = {With the deepening of the problem of population aging, the problems of physical aging and cognitive decline that accompany age have received increasing attention from researchers. Cognitive frailty refers to an elderly clinic with cognitive impairment caused by physical frailty or pre-frailty syndrome. The occurrence of cognitive frailty will reduce the ability of the elderly to perform activities of daily living and reduce the quality of life of the elderly in their later years. If an early intelligent health management of the symptoms of cognitive frailty can be carried out, it is of great significance to delay its progress and achieve healthy aging. Scholars at home and abroad have made some explorations on the smart health management of cognitive frailty. Therefore, this article summarizes the cognitive frailty smart health management of the elderly from the aspects of cognitive frailty screening, monitoring and evaluation, and intervention based on the review of domestic and foreign literature. The progress of the research on cognitive frailty has put forward suggestions for smart health management of cognitive frailty, providing ideas for the early identification and intervention of cognitive frailty of the elderly in my country and the construction of smart health management programs. Through reviewing relevant literature, it is found that foreign countries pay more attention to the health management of cognitive frailty in the elderly, and remote assessment and smart intervention are well developed. However, the research on cognitive frailty in my country is in the initial stage of development, and the related health management and intervention content is relatively large. The smart health management of cognitive frailty abroad can provide a reference for the health management of cognitive frailty in the elderly in my country. Early smart health management of cognitive frailty plays an important role in maintaining the core abilities of the elderly and maintaining the health of the elderly.},

abstract = {Writing training systems have been developed to provide students with instruction and deliberate practice on their writing. Although generally successful in providing accurate scores, a common criticism of these systems is their lack of personalization and adaptive instruction. In particular, these systems tend to place the strongest emphasis on delivering accurate scores, and therefore, tend to overlook additional indices that may contribute to students' success, such as their affective states during writing practice. This study takes an initial step toward addressing this gap by building a predictive model of students' affect using information that can potentially be collected by computer systems. We used individual difference measures, text indices, and keystroke analyses to predict engagement and boredom in 132 writing sessions. The results suggest that these three categories of indices were successful in modeling students' affective states during writing. Taken together, indices related to students' academic abilities, text properties, and keystroke logs were able classify high and low engagement and boredom in writing sessions with accuracies between 76.5% and 77.3%. These results suggest that information readily available in writing training systems can inform affect detectors and ultimately improve student models within intelligent tutoring systems.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world’s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.In this survey, we first introduce the impact of edge computing on the development of IoT and point out why edge computing is more suitable for IoT than other computing paradigms. Then, we analyze the necessity of systematical investigation on the edge-computing-driven IoT (ECDriven-IoT) and summarize new challenges occurring in ECDriven-IoT. We categorize recent advances from bottom to top, covering six aspects of ECDriven-IoT. Finally, we conclude lessons learned and propose some challenging},

BD and its symptoms can also show through online behaviors, suggesting an opportunity to use an online data-driven approach to managing BD. However, designing technologies to support individuals with SMIs have unique concerns, such as privacy and agency. In this proposed work, I mean to understand the feasibility and acceptance of a BD intervention system that uses online behavioral data to infer mood episode onset. Throughout this I mean to explore patient and clinician needs for managing BD through a data-driven intervention, as well as attitudes toward sharing personal data within social support networks to help support treatment, to develop a prototype for future evaluation. In conclusion, I present preliminary findings on patient acceptance, common problematic behaviors, and the role of patient-clinician relationships.},

Several contexts dissuade such behaviors, but some may trigger adverse impulsive behaviors. We define these latter contexts as 'opportunity' contexts, as their passive detection from sensors can be used to deliver context-sensitive interventions.In this paper, we define the general concept of 'opportunity' contexts and apply it to the case of smoking cessation. We operationalize the smoking 'opportunity' context, using self-reported smoking allowance and cigarette availability. We show its clinical utility by establishing its association with smoking occurrences using Granger causality. Next, we mine several informative features from GPS traces, including the novel location context of smoking spots, to develop the SmokingOpp model for automatically detecting the smoking 'opportunity' context. Finally, we train and evaluate the SmokingOpp model using 15 million GPS points and 3,432 self-reports from 90 newly abstinent smokers in a smoking cessation study.},

Such worn devices are well studied on the wrists, arms, and head, however, many unconventional yet context-rich areas of the body remain underexplored. Current haptic prototyping techniques have large instrumentation costs, requiring the design of bespoke embedded devices that do not have the flexibility to be applied to other body sites. In this work, we introduce an open-source prototyping toolkit for designing, fabricating, and programming wearable compression-based interfaces, or compressables. Our approach uses a lost-PVA technique for making custom inflatable silicone bladders, an off-the-shelf pneumatics controller, and a mobile app to explore and tune haptic interactions through sketch gestures. We validate the toolkit’s open-endedness through a user study and heuristic evaluation. We use exemplar artifacts to annotate the design space of compressables and discuss opportunities to further expand haptic expression on the body.},

abstract = {Opioid use disorder is a medical condition with major social and economic consequences. While ubiquitous physiological sensing technologies have been widely adopted and extensively used to monitor day-to-day activities and deliver targeted interventions to improve human health, the use of these technologies to detect drug use in natural environments has been largely underexplored. The long-term goal of our work is to develop a mobile technology system that can identify high-risk opioid-related events (i.e., development of tolerance in the setting of prescription opioid use, return-to-use events in the setting of opioid use disorder) and deploy just-in-time interventions to mitigate the risk of overdose morbidity and mortality. In the current paper, we take an initial step by asking a crucial question: Can opioid use be detected using physiological signals obtained from a wrist-mounted sensor? Thirty-six individuals who were admitted to the hospital for an acute painful condition and received opioid analgesics as part of their clinical care were enrolled. Subjects wore a noninvasive wrist sensor during this time (1-14 days) that continuously measured physiological signals (heart rate, skin temperature, accelerometry, electrodermal activity, and interbeat interval). We collected a total of 2070 hours (≈ 86 days) of physiological data and observed a total of 339 opioid administrations. Our results are encouraging and show that using a Channel-Temporal Attention TCN (CTA-TCN) model, we can detect an opioid administration in a time-window with an F1-score of 0.80, a specificity of 0.77, sensitivity of 0.80, and an AUC of 0.77. We also predict the exact moment of administration in this time-window with a normalized mean absolute error of 8.6% and R2 coefficient of 0.85.},

With most mHealth research conducted with a predominantly white population, the answer to this question is lacking. In this study, we address this question through a survey study with Hispanic users of fitness applications (N= 211) and use the Motivational Technology Model (MTM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as theoretical frameworks. We found that using interactivity features is essential to inspire more autonomous forms of motivation to use fitness applications. This is because interactivity helps satisfy users’ needs for relatedness. However, interactivity also decreased autonomy and competence suggesting the need to design fitness applications that increase relatedness without compromising autonomy. Implications for the design of fitness applications for the population at large and Hispanics, in particular, are discussed.},

abstract = {Smartphone overuse poses risks to people’s physical and mental health. However, current intervention techniques mainly focus on explicitly changing screen content (i.e., output) and often fail to persistently reduce smartphone overuse due to being over-restrictive or over-flexible. We present the design and implementation of InteractOut, a suite of implicit input manipulation techniques that leverage interaction proxies to weakly inhibit the natural execution of common user gestures on mobile devices. We present a design space for input manipulations and demonstrate 8 Android implementations of input interventions. We first conducted a pilot lab study (N=30) to evaluate the usability of these interventions. Based on the results, we then performed a 5-week within-subject field experiment (N=42) to evaluate InteractOut in real-world scenarios. Compared to the traditional and common timed lockout technique, InteractOut significantly reduced the usage time by an additional 15.6% and opening frequency by 16.5% on participant-selected target apps. InteractOut also achieved a 25.3% higher user acceptance rate, and resulted in less frustration and better user experience according to participants’ subjective feedback. InteractOut demonstrates a new direction for smartphone overuse intervention and serves as a strong complementary set of techniques with existing methods.},

To address this problem, we have developed Emu, a framework that eases the development of context-aware study applications by providing a concise and powerful interface for specifying temporal- and contextual-constraints for task notifications. In this paper we present the design of the Emu API and demonstrate its use in capturing a range of scenarios common to smartphone-based study applications.},

AdHocProx achives this via sensors including dual ultra-wideband (UWB) radios for sensing distance and angle to other devices in dynamic, ad-hoc arrangements; plus capacitive grip to determine where the user’s hands hold the device, and to partially correct for the resulting UWB signal attenuation. All spatial sensing and communication takes place via the side-channel capability of the UWB radios, suitable for small-group collaboration across up to four devices (eight UWB radios). Together, these sensors detect proximity and natural, socially meaningful device movements to enable contextual interaction techniques. We find that AdHocProx can obtain 95% accuracy recognizing various ad-hoc device arrangements in an offline evaluation, with participants particularly appreciative of interaction techniques that automatically leverage proximity-awareness and relative orientation amongst multiple devices.},

abstract = {A variety of health and behavioral states can potentially be inferred from physiological measurements that can now be collected in the natural free-living environment. The major challenge, however, is to develop computational models for automated detection of health events that can work reliably in the natural field environment. In this paper, we develop a physiologically-informed model to automatically detect drug (cocaine) use events in the free-living environment of participants from their electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The key to reliably detecting drug use events in the field is to incorporate the knowledge of autonomic nervous system (ANS) behavior in the model development so as to decompose the activation effect of cocaine from the natural recovery behavior of the parasympathetic nervous system (after an episode of physical activity). We collect 89 days of data from 9 active drug users in two residential lab environments and 922 days of data from 42 active drug users in the field environment, for a total of 11,283 hours. We develop a model that tracks the natural recovery by the parasympathetic nervous system and then estimates the dampening caused to the recovery by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system due to cocaine. We develop efficient methods to screen and clean the ECG time series data and extract candidate windows to assess for potential drug use. We then apply our model on the recovery segments from these windows. Our model achieves 100% true positive rate while keeping the false positive rate to 0.87/day over (9+ hours/day of) lab data and to 1.13/day over (11+ hours/day of) field data.},

abstract = {Persons that suffered from a cardiac disease are often recommended to integrate a sufficient level of physical exercise in their daily life. Initially, cardiac rehabilitation takes place in a closely monitored setting in a hospital or a rehabilitation center. Sustaining the effort once the patient has left the ambulatory, supervised environment is a challenge, and drop-out rates are high. Emerging approaches such as telemonitoring and telerehabilitation have been proven to show the potential to support the cardiac patient in adhering to the advised physical exercise. However, most telerehabilitation solutions only support a limited range of physical exercise, such as step-counting during walking. We propose BoB (Back on Bike), a mobile application that guides cardiac patients while cycling. Design choices are explained according to three pillars: ease of use, reduce fear, and direct and indirect motivation. In this paper, we report the results from a field study with cardiac patients.},

abstract = {Craving usually precedes a lapse for impulsive behaviors such as overeating, drinking, smoking, and drug use. Passive estimation of craving from sensor data in the natural environment can be used to assist users in coping with craving. In this paper, we take the first steps towards developing a computational model to estimate cigarette craving (during smoking abstinence) at the minute-level using mobile sensor data. We use 2,012 hours of sensor data and 1,812 craving self-reports from 61 participants in a smoking cessation study. To estimate craving, we first obtain a continuous measure of stress from sensor data. We find that during hours of day when craving is high, stress associated with self-reported high craving is greater than stress associated with low craving. We use this and other insights to develop feature functions, and encode them as pattern detectors in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based model to infer craving probabilities.},

abstract = {Albeit offering many benefits, smartphones can pose a severe privacy threat to users. While some users might simply be not aware of privacy issues, others are highly motivated to protect their data, but lack the ability and knowledge to do so. We developed an Android-based application called "FoxIT", which provides users with several education modules as well as a static smartphone and app permission analysis to increase both, privacy awareness and knowledge of mobile users. We conducted a first evaluation of FoxIT in a two-week field study with 31 users and were able to show that use of FoxIT not only leads to increased privacy awareness, but also improves knowledge about privacy related topics. Participants also reported to have improved the privacy conditions on their smartphone, actively informed themselves about privacy related topics, and prompted others to protect their data after using FoxIT. Our results indicate that it might be a promising approach to improve mobile users' privacy behavior by raising awareness and providing background information about privacy related topics.},

abstract = {Protective behavior exhibited by people with chronic pain (CP) during physical activities is very informative to understanding their physical and emotional states. Existing automatic protective behavior detection (PBD) methods rely on pre-segmentation of activities predefined by users. However, in real life, people perform activities casually. Therefore, where those activities present difficulties for people with CP, technology-enabled support should be delivered continuously and automatically adapted to activity type and occurrence of protective behavior. Hence, to facilitate ubiquitous CP management, it becomes critical to enable accurate PBD over continuous data. In this paper, we propose to integrate human activity recognition (HAR) with PBD via a novel hierarchical HAR-PBD architecture comprising graph-convolution and long short-term memory (GC-LSTM) networks, and alleviate class imbalances using a class-balanced focal categorical cross-entropy (CFCC) loss. Through in-depth evaluation of the approach using a CP patients' dataset, we show that the leveraging of HAR, GC-LSTM networks, and CFCC loss leads to clear increase in PBD performance against the baseline (macro F1 score of 0.81 vs. 0.66 and precision-recall area-under-the-curve (PR-AUC) of 0.60 vs. 0.44). We conclude by discussing possible use cases of the hierarchical architecture in CP management and beyond. We also discuss current limitations and ways forward.},

abstract = {As smart mobile phones permeate society, so too does the opportunity to use these technologies to unobtrusively capture patterns of daily life and interact with people in situ. The ability to record facets of daily life has given rise to the notion of the quantified self; researchers operating at the intersection of computer and social science are now seeking to understand how these mobiles' data can aide the design of health interventions and inform future psychological and social science research.However, current systems are not fully effortless: they require users to interrupt their activities in order to initiate the recording, annotation, or journaling of their experiences. Suitably seeking users' attention and incentivising them to engage with, for example, health applications, continues to be a main obstacle to the adoption of these services. In this work, we describe the design of a new application that seeks user feedback about their gastrointestinal health in an idle moment: when the user is sitting on the toilet. We describe the application's design, the health insights it provides (and, particularly, why it is not designed as a diagnostic tool), as well as early data that the system has collected. We close by discussing the opportunity that idle moments present for future health intervention applications.},

abstract = {Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been shown to have a positive impact on health outcomes of the households they visit, particularly in maternal and neonatal health. As the first line of the public health system in many countries, they are a critical link to the broader public health infrastructure for community members. Yet they do this all with minimal training and limited support infrastructure. To a pregnant woman, an ASHA is a trusted ally in navigating the health system---information gathered is returned by appropriate advice and counseling. To the health system, the ASHA is a key channel of valuable householdlevel information for the public health system, yet she generally receives minimal guidance in return. In this paper we present ASTA---the ASHA Self-Tracking Application---a system that provides ASHAs with timely, on-demand information regarding their own performance compared to their peers. Using ASTA, ASHAs access comparative performance data through both a web-based and voice-based interface on demand. We evaluated ASTA through a 12-month deployment with 142 ASHAs in Uttar Pradesh, India, assessing the impact of providing feedback on ASHA performance. We find that ASHAs with access to the ASTA system made significantly more client visits, with average monthly visits 21.5% higher than ASHAs who had access to a control system. In addition, higher ASHA performance was correlated with increased usage of ASTA. However, the performance improvement was front-loaded, with the impact of the system decreasing toward the end of the study period. Taken together, our findings provide promising evidence that studying and incorporating tools like ASTA could be cost effective and impactful for ASHA programs.},

Our study purposefully designed a parent peer-support community for parents seeking support. Our two-phased qualitative study included parent interviews and design workshops. Our findings show that while parents need others’ lived experiences to learn about parenting, perceived judgment and self-doubt can stop them from actively contributing to the peer support group. To address this design challenge, we operationalised parents’ needs and challenges gained in the interviews and workshops into design implications. We demonstrate a parent-centered design approach where we formulate design implications that integrate parents’ needs and expectations with multidisciplinary theoretical and empirical evidence to deepen and concretise the design for an online parent peer-support community that cultivates empathy, encourages confidence and self-efficacy, and motivates change and growth.},

abstract = {Problematic smartphone use negatively affects physical and mental health. Despite the wide range of prior research, existing persuasive techniques are not flexible enough to provide dynamic persuasion content based on users’ physical contexts and mental states. We first conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=12) and an interview study (N=10) to summarize the mental states behind problematic smartphone use: boredom, stress, and inertia. This informs our design of four persuasion strategies: understanding, comforting, evoking, and scaffolding habits. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) to enable the automatic and dynamic generation of effective persuasion content. We developed MindShift, a novel LLM-powered problematic smartphone use intervention technique. MindShift takes users’ in-the-moment app usage behaviors, physical contexts, mental states, goals &amp; habits as input, and generates personalized and dynamic persuasive content with appropriate persuasion strategies. We conducted a 5-week field experiment (N=25) to compare MindShift with its simplified version (remove mental states) and baseline techniques (fixed reminder). The results show that MindShift improves intervention acceptance rates by 4.7-22.5% and reduces smartphone usage duration by 7.4-9.8%. Moreover, users have a significant drop in smartphone addiction scale scores and a rise in self-efficacy scale scores. Our study sheds light on the potential of leveraging LLMs for context-aware persuasion in other behavior change domains.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications. As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, education, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial components in assessing the performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at:},

abstract = {Digital food content’s popularity is underscored by recent studies revealing its addictive nature and association with disordered eating. Notably, individuals with eating disorders exhibit a positive correlation between their digital food content consumption and disordered eating behaviors. Based on these findings, we introduce FoodCensor, an intervention designed to empower individuals with eating disorders to make informed, conscious, and health-oriented digital food content consumption decisions. FoodCensor (i)&nbsp;monitors and hides passively exposed food content on smartphones and personal computers, and (ii)&nbsp;prompts reflective questions for users when they spontaneously search for food content. We deployed FoodCensor to people with binge eating disorder or bulimia (n=22) for three weeks. Our user study reveals that FoodCensor fostered self-awareness and self-reflection about unconscious digital food content consumption habits, enabling them to adopt healthier behaviors consciously. Furthermore, we discuss design implications for promoting healthier digital content consumption practices for vulnerable populations to specific content types.},

Data was collected from 89 students related to their reading activities both in and out of the class in a Freshman English course. Students are given a task to study reading materials through the eBook system, highlight the text that is related to the main or supporting ideas, and answer the questions prepared for measuring their level of comprehension. Students in and out of class reading times and their usage of the marker feature were used as a proxy to understand their study approaches. We used theory-driven and data-driven approaches together to model the study approaches of students. Our results showed that three groups of students who have different study approaches could be identified. Relationships between students' reading behaviors and their academic performance is also investigated by using association rule mining analysis. Obtained results are discussed in terms of monitoring, feedback, predicting learning outcomes, and identifying problems with the content design.},

Technology-based rehabilitation has been proven to be beneficial for specific patient groups, as it shows to be effective on muscle strength and active range of motion of the upper limbs. Personalized training in technology-supported rehabilitation setups using motivational techniques such as serious games have the potential to make repetitive training efforts more endurable. Most neurological rehabilitation approaches suffer from a strict separation between training scenarios and activities in daily living, but have difficulties to bridge the gap between exercising on a functional level and performing on the level of activities in daily living. To improve the integration of motor skill training in a daily living context we propose an approach and proof-of-concept implementation of the training device ReHappy, a tangible character that engages patient in performing additional training that complements the daily activities.},

The findings from the interview of 25 stakeholders reveal some socio-cultural factors such as negative perceptions, stigmatizations, religious beliefs, and absence of automated supports, which hinder mental healthcare and help-seeking. Also, delays in seeking appropriate medical attention and intake of untested local herbs could lead to severe depressive symptoms, suicidal risks, and adversely affect the mental health of clients. Based on our findings, and in collaboration with the stakeholders, we designed "Gwam-Okwu" [Talk to Me]; a culturally-appropriate interactive app that is hyper-localized, safe and secured, and tailored to support communication and collaboration between health workers and clients/relations, personalized self-monitoring, and guided self-learning for the clients.},

Does it matter how the information is conveyed? This paper presents findings from a randomized field experiment that evaluates the impact of a Short Message Service (SMS) sexual health counseling service on individuals' knowledge and behavior in an urban informal settlement of Nairobi, Kenya. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions which tested different mechanisms through which technology-enabled information provision could work to alter sexual behavior: (1) information gap reduction, (2) personalization and (3) social cues. The evidence suggests that personalizing the information and providing signals about how other people in the community are behaving can dramatically minimize sexual health risk, compared to simply reducing the information gap. Additionally, individuals receiving generic, non-personalized health information were more likely to engage in risky behavior compared to their counterparts.},

We extend the scope to include work on related technologies such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction as crucial components, if not the origins, of MR, as well as numerous related work from the larger area of mobile devices, wearables, and Internet-of-Things. We highlight the lack of investigation, implementation, and evaluation of data protection approaches in MR. Further challenges and directions on MR security and privacy are also discussed.},

abstract = {Videos can be a powerful medium for acquiring soft skills, where learning requires contextualisation in personal experience and ability to see different perspectives. However, to learn effectively while watching videos, students need to actively engage with video content. We implemented interactive notetaking during video watching in an active video watching system (AVW) as a means to encourage engagement. This paper proposes a systematic approach to utilise learning analytics for the introduction of adaptive intervention - a choice architecture for personalised nudges in the AVW to extend learning. A user study was conducted and used as an illustration. By characterising clusters derived from user profiles, we identify different styles of engagement, such as parochial learning, habitual video watching, and self-regulated learning (which is the target ideal behaviour). To find opportunities for interventions, interaction traces in the AVW were used to identify video intervals with high user interest and relevant behaviour patterns that indicate when nudges may be triggered. A prediction model was developed to identify comments that are likely to have high social value, and can be used as examples in nudges. A framework for interactive personalised nudges was then conceptualised for the case study.},

While CR has been well theorized psychologically and many therapeutic approaches exist, CR remains one of the toughest skills to learn and develop. We explore the design space of using technologically-mediated CR supports through a dual approach. First, we draw on a content analysis of 30 therapeutic manuals combined with five clinician interviews to understand existing CR processes and challenges in therapeutic settings. Second, we compare the identified challenges with a scoping review of 42 HCI papers on technologically-mediated CR interventions. This allowed us to identify trends and gaps in a field where digital health innovations are critically needed; and suggest four design opportunities that warrant further exploration. Together, our work contributes theoretically-derived future research opportunities, and provides researchers with concrete guidance to explore these important design spaces.},

Using a feature analysis evaluation technique, this paper proposes a comparison framework for reviewing technological tools/applications that can be used to assist teaching, assessment and feedback.

It causes low self-esteem among other detrimental effects on people who stutter (PwS). Although prior work has explored approaches to assist PwS, they primarily focused on western contexts. In our formative study, we found unique practices and challenges among Chinese PwS. We then iteratively designed an online tool, CoPracTter, to support Chinese PwS practicing speaking fluency with 1) targeted stress-inducing practice scenarios, 2) real-time speech indicators, and 3) personalized timely feedback from the community. We further conducted a seven-day deployment study (N=11) to understand how participants utilized these key features. To our knowledge, it is the first time such a prototype was designed and tested for a long time with multiple PwS participants online simultaneously. Results indicate that personalized practice with targeted scenarios and timely feedback from a supportive community assisted PwS in speaking fluently, staying positive, and facing similar real-life circumstances.},

Despite this, prior digital phenotype research has primarily focused on disorder-level detection rather than symptom-level detection. In this research, we predict the existence of individual symptoms of MDD and GAD with SMS log metadata, and ensemble these symptom-level classifiers to screen for depression and anxiety, thus accounting for disorder heterogeneity. Further, we collect an additional dataset of retrospectively harvested SMS logs to augment an existing dataset collected after COVID-19 altered communication patterns, and propose two new types of distribution features: consecutive messages and conversation ratio. Our symptom-level detectors achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.7 in 13 of the 16 MDD and GAD symptoms, with reply latency distribution features achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.78 when detecting anxiety symptom trouble relaxing. When combined into disorder-level ensembles, these symptom-level detectors achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.76 for depression screening and 0.73 for anxiety screening, with tree boosting methods demonstrating particular efficacy. Accounting for disorder heterogeneity, our research provides insight into the value of SMS logs for the assessment of depression and anxiety diagnostic criteria.},

We investigated the contextual factors that influence young adults’ day-to-day experiences when interacting with such tools.

We developed two messaging dialogues centered around these factors, which we deployed to 42 participants to test and extend our initial understanding of users’ needs. Across both studies, participants provided diverse opinions of how they could be best supported by messages, particularly around when to engage users in more passive versus active ways. They also proposed ways of adjusting message length and content during periods of low mood.

abstract = {With the continuous expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the increasing connectivity among the various intelligent devices or systems, the control of access and fusion in smart factory networks has significantly gained importance. However, the contradiction between the high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of massive data and the limited network bandwidth and the heterogeneous network is becoming deeper and deeper. The heterogeneity of smart factory networks brings many challenges to unified access and fusion, real-time transmission, and centralized control and management. This article provides a survey on heterogeneous networks in smart factories. We first study and discuss the heterogeneity of smart factory networks, and then discuss the existing mainstream wired and wireless network technologies, as well as promising future technologies, including 5G, OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In addition, we also analyze current heterogeneous network fusion architecture and discuss the enabling technologies of heterogeneous network fusion in view of the shortcoming of the current solutions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards the effective realization of the smart factory.},

abstract = {Depression and anxiety among college students have been on the rise globally. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has emerged as an empirically reinforced and effective treatment. However, factors like cost, lack of resources, misguided prioritization and stigmatization of mental health issues in the Global South limit students’ access to psychotherapy. While technology can bridge this gap, research shows current self-guided mHealth apps for CBT are not always evidence-based and have limited efficacy compared to therapist-guided alternatives. In this paper, we explore whether interactive storytelling and other gamification mechanisms can increase the efficacy of a self-guided mHealth app, while drawing from empirically supported CBT protocols. We designed an mHealth application with contextualised storylines to help students learn psychological concepts and better identify the negative patterns in their thoughts. We present the results of a 3-arm randomized controlled trial conducted to assess the effect of this application compared to active and inactive control conditions.},

abstract = {In chronic pain rehabilitation, physiotherapists adapt physical activity to patients’ performance based on their expression of protective behavior, gradually exposing them to feared but harmless and essential everyday activities. As rehabilitation moves outside the clinic, technology should automatically detect such behavior to provide similar support. Previous works have shown the feasibility of automatic protective behavior detection (PBD) within a specific activity. In this article, we investigate the use of deep learning for PBD across activity types, using wearable motion capture and surface electromyography data collected from healthy participants and people with chronic pain. We approach the problem by continuously detecting protective behavior within an activity rather than estimating its overall presence. The best performance reaches mean F1 score of 0.82 with leave-one-subject-out cross validation. When protective behavior is modeled per activity type, performance achieves a mean F1 score of 0.77 for bend-down, 0.81 for one-leg-stand, 0.72 for sit-to-stand, 0.83 for stand-to-sit, and 0.67 for reach-forward. This performance reaches excellent level of agreement with the average experts’ rating performance suggesting potential for personalized chronic pain management at home. We analyze various parameters characterizing our approach to understand how the results could generalize to other PBD datasets and different levels of ground truth granularity.},

abstract = {Mobile health applications are fast becoming an influential source of information for pregnant women. These technologies have been shown to help women monitor their progress during their pregnancy and personalise healthcare to suit their needs. Limited research has been directed towards understanding usage behaviours with these apps. Various authors have argued that there is a need to expand the scope of research from simple usage behaviour to deeper levels, as technology becomes more sophisticated and easily available. As such, this research explores post-adoption usage of mobile health pregnancy applications in the South African context based on Hsieh and Zmud's [1] post-adoption usage stages of acceptance, routinization and infusion. Open-ended semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve pregnant women. The findings revealed that pregnant women displayed post adoption routinization behaviours of routine use and IS continuance. With regards to infusion, the study found that pregnant women engaged in extended usage and deep usage. They did not engage in third stage behaviours, namely emergent use, feature extension or intention to explore. The research recognises m-health pregnancy support apps as important tools in the pregnancy journey. It highlights how pregnant women value these apps and view them as information sources and for reassurance during their pregnancy.},

abstract = {In recent years, distributed intelligent microelectromechanical systems (DiMEMSs) have appeared as a new form of distributed embedded systems. DiMEMSs contain thousands or millions of removable autonomous devices, which will collaborate with each other to achieve the final target of the whole system. Programming such systems is becoming an extremely difficult problem. The difficulty is due not only to their inherent nature of distributed collaboration, mobility, large scale, and limited resources of their devices (e.g., in terms of energy, memory, communication, and computation) but also to the requirements of real-time control and tolerance for uncertainties such as inaccurate actuation and unreliable communications. As a result, existing programming languages for traditional distributed and embedded systems are not suitable for DiMEMSs. In this article, we first introduce the origin and characteristics of DiMEMSs and then survey typical implementations of DiMEMSs and related research hotspots. Finally, we propose a real-time programming framework that can be used to design new real-time programming languages for DiMEMSs. The framework is composed of three layers: a real-time programming model layer, a compilation layer, and a runtime system layer. The design challenges and requirements of these layers are investigated. The framework is then discussed in further detail and suggestions for future research are given.},

However, there have never been studies employing living body's physiological states to be expressed solely through the voice of such VCAs yet. As physiological expressions of such VCAs can have potential for manifesting health-related issues in a human-like way, we selected healthcare scenarios as a case for exploring novel user experiences that they can induce. We conducted design workshops for identifying design considerations and design opportunities for the physiologically expressible VCAs in the healthcare service domain. Following these findings, we designed the new concept of physiologically expressible healthcare VCAs and conducted a Wizard-of-Oz user study. Finally, we summarize the unique user experiences on physiologically expressible VCA's healthcare services and user perceptions of its physiological expressions, and discuss design implications for physiologically expressible VCAs.},

abstract = {The rates of mental illness, especially anxiety and depression, have increased greatly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional mental illness screening instruments are too cumbersome and biased to screen an entire population. In contrast, smartphone call and text logs passively capture communication patterns and thus represent a promising screening alternative. To facilitate the advancement of such research, we collect and curate the DepreST Call and Text log (DepreST-CAT) dataset from over 365 crowdsourced participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The logs are labeled with traditional anxiety and depression screening scores essential for training machine learning models. We construct time series ranging from 2 to 16 weeks in length from the retrospective smartphone logs. To demonstrate the screening capabilities of these time series, we then train a variety of unimodal and multimodal machine and deep learning models. These models provide insights into the relative screening value of the different types of logs, lengths of log time series, and classification methods. The DepreST-CAT dataset is a valuable resource for the research community to model communication patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic and further the development of machine learning algorithms for passive mental illness screening.},

Traditional, vision-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods, however, are vulnerable to external factors like occlusion and lighting, while also raising privacy concerns coupled with the impractical requirement of positioning the camera in front of the user at all times. To bridge this gap, we propose ExpressEar, a novel FER system that repurposes commercial earables augmented with inertial sensors to capture fine-grained facial muscle movements. Following the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which encodes every possible expression in terms of constituent facial movements called Action Units (AUs), ExpressEar identifies facial expressions at the atomic level. We conducted a user study (N=12) to evaluate the performance of our approach and found that ExpressEar can detect and distinguish between 32 Facial AUs (including 2 variants of asymmetric AUs), with an average accuracy of 89.9% for any given user. We further quantify the performance across different mobile scenarios in presence of additional face-related activities. Our results demonstrate ExpressEar's applicability in the real world and open up research opportunities to advance its practical adoption.},

abstract = {Mind wandering (MW) is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has a negative influence on performance and productivity in many contexts. We propose that intelligent interfaces should have some mechanism to detect and respond to MW in real-time. Towards this end, we developed an interface that automatically detects MW from eye-gaze during computerized reading. When MW is detected, the interface intervenes by asking just-in-time questions and encouraging re-reading as needed. After multiple rounds of iterative refinement, we summatively compared the interface to a yoked control condition in a randomized control trial with 104 participants. Preliminary results suggest that the system was successful in correcting comprehension deficits attributed to MW, thereby highlighting the potential for intelligent interfaces that improve performance by "attending to attention."},

This article reports our experiences with two iterations of the first large online class to use peer and self-assessment. In this class, peer grades correlated highly with staff-assigned grades. The second iteration had 42.9% of students’ grades within 5% of the staff grade, and 65.5% within 10%. On average, students assessed their work 7% higher than staff did. Students also rated peers’ work from their own country 3.6% higher than those from elsewhere. We performed three experiments to improve grading accuracy. We found that giving students feedback about their grading bias increased subsequent accuracy. We introduce short, customizable feedback snippets that cover common issues with assignments, providing students more qualitative peer feedback. Finally, we introduce a data-driven approach that highlights high-variance items for improvement. We find that rubrics that use a parallel sentence structure, unambiguous wording, and well-specified dimensions have lower variance. After revising rubrics, median grading error decreased from 12.4% to 9.9%.},

As these systems deliver an addictive substance, consumers face a danger of becoming addicted. To understand the motivations and habits surrounding electronic nicotine consumption to aid consumers manage their vaping behavior, we conducted a literature review (N=72) and collected data using an online survey (N = 15). Our specific aim is to identify any triggering factors including physical or physiological states, habits, and contexts associated with ENDS use. Our survey identified several important insights related to e-cigarette consumption: i) contrary to traditional cigarette consumption habits, most participants did not report that there were any habits or contexts associated with their use, ii) most of our participants did not measure vaping in discrete sessions, which is very different from traditional cigarettes, and iii) stress is not a powerful trigger for vaping urges, contrary to traditional cigarettes where stress is considered as one of the key triggering factors. Additionally, we found that the vaping device itself can be used as the most useful device for collecting data on vaping behavior, especially since consumers keep their vaping device on their person or within reach and chest band and wristbands are considered burdensome by the users. These findings have critical implications for the computing community as they indicate that vaping practices and associated habits are significantly different than traditional smoking and warrants developing computational models that would be able to identify vaping triggers, design interventions specific to vaping practices and identify opportune moments to deliver intervention to assist consumers manage their vaping behavior.},

abstract = {Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of AI tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This article outlines our collaborative, human-centered approach to developing an AI application that predicts treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving human-supported, internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Intersecting the fields of HCI, AI, and healthcare, we describe how we addressed the specific challenges of (1) identifying clinically relevant AI applications; and (2) designing AI applications for sensitive use contexts like mental health. Aiming to better assist the work practices of iCBT supporters, we share how learnings from an interview study with 15 iCBT supporters surfaced their practices and information needs and revealed new opportunities for the use of AI. Combined with insights from the clinical literature and technical feasibility constraints, this led to the development of two clinical outcome prediction models. To clarify their potential utility for use in practice, we conducted 13 design sessions with iCBT supporters that utilized interface mock-ups to concretize the AI output and derive additional design requirements. Our findings demonstrate how design choices can impact interpretations of the AI predictions as well as supporter motivation and sense of agency. We detail how this analysis and the design principles derived from it enabled the integration of the prediction models into a production interface. Reporting on identified risks of over-reliance on AI outputs and needs for balanced information assessment and preservation of a focus on individualized care, we discuss and reflect on what constitutes a responsible, human-centered approach to AI design in this healthcare context.},

Tangible interfaces designed for well-being possess the capabilities to reduce anxiety or manage panic attacks, thus improving the quality of life for both the general population and vulnerable members of society. Real-time biofeedback paired with Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities for mental well-being to be inferred allowing individually personalised interventional feedback to be automatically applied. This research explores future directions for bio-feedback including the opportunity to fuse multiple AI enabled feedback mechanisms that can then be utilised collectively or individually.},

abstract = {We report our experience of an extracurricular online intervention on cryptography in Grade 10. Our first goal is to describe how we taught some fundamental cryptography ideas by making students encounter a progression of representative cryptosystems, from classical to modern, and discover their characteristics and limitations. We used Snap! (a visual programming language) to realize hands-on activities: block-programming playgrounds (a form of task-specific programming languages) to experiment with cryptosystems, and an interactive app to support an unplugged (albeit remote) Diffie-Hellman key agreement. After experimenting with each system, the students were involved in a Socratic discussion on how to overcome the discovered limitations, motivating the introduction of the following system in our path. Our second goal is to evaluate the students' perceptions and learning of cryptography core ideas. They appreciated the course and felt that, despite being remote, it was fun and engaging. According to the students, the course helped them understand the role of cryptography, CS, and Math in society and sparked their interest in cryptography and CS. The final assessment showed that the students well understood the cryptography ideas addressed. Our third goal is to discuss what worked and areas of improvement. The "remote-unplugged" Diffie-Hellman, where the meeting chat was a metaphor for the public channel, engaged the students in understanding this groundbreaking protocol. Overall, they praised the activities as engaging, even when challenging. However, a strong "instructor blindness" induced by remote teaching often prevented us from giving the students the right amount of guidance during the exploration activities.},

abstract = {Healthcare workers are constantly exposed to high-stress working conditions that increase burnout rates and lower the quality of patient care. While it is vital to continuously monitor healthcare worker stress to provide necessary interventions, traditional survey methods can interfere with tasks in real-world healthcare contexts. Wearable devices offer a non-invasive way to detect worker stress continuously, however, predictions may be influenced by context-specific activities and stress semantics. Our work assesses generalized stress detection for health workers with currently available datasets using shared stress representations. We tested four machine learning algorithms (support vector machines, random forest, feed-forward networks, and extreme boosting). We identified extreme boosting as the top-performing model, achieving ROC-AUC scores of up to 0.83 using real-world health worker data. To benchmark generalizability among machine learning stress detection models, we assessed domain adaptation to enhance the transferability of models. Supervised domain adaptation performs comparably to vanilla prediction methods on the target domain. Our work identifies numerous challenges to generalizing stress detection for health workers, including limited shared modalities, small sample sizes, and varying stress definitions. As more data is collected, we must prioritize shared stress representations to enable continuous stress prediction for health workers.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the use of face masks across the world. Aside from physical distancing, they are among the most effective protection for healthcare workers and the general population. Face masks are passive devices, however, and cannot alert the user in case of improper fit or mask degradation. Additionally, face masks are optimally positioned to give unique insight into some personal health metrics. Recognizing this limitation and opportunity, we present FaceBit: an open-source research platform for smart face mask applications. FaceBit's design was informed by needfinding studies with a cohort of health professionals. Small and easily secured into any face mask, FaceBit is accompanied by a mobile application that provides a user interface and facilitates research. It monitors heart rate without skin contact via ballistocardiography, respiration rate via temperature changes, and mask-fit and wear time from pressure signals, all on-device with an energy-efficient runtime system. FaceBit can harvest energy from breathing, motion, or sunlight to supplement its tiny primary cell battery that alone delivers a battery lifetime of 11 days or more. FaceBit empowers the mobile computing community to jumpstart research in smart face mask sensing and inference, and provides a sustainable, convenient form factor for health management, applicable to COVID-19 frontline workers and beyond.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss our experience in building an automated dance assessment tool with IMU and IoT devices and highlight the major challenges of such an endeavor. In a typical dance classroom scenario, where the students frequently outnumber their instructors, such a system can add an immense value to both parties by providing systematic breakdown of the dance moves, comparing the dance moves between the students and the instructors, and pinpointing the places for improvement in an autonomous way. Along that direction, our prototypical work, HappyFeet [1], showcases our initial attempts of developing such an intelligent Dance Activity Recognition (DAR) system. Our CNN based Body Sensor Network proves more effective (by ≈7% margin at 94.20%) at accurately recognizing the micro-steps of the dance activities than traditional feature engineering approaches. These metrics are derived by purposely evaluating the setup on a dance form known for its gentle, smooth and subtle limb movements. In this paper, we articulate how our proposed DAR framework will be generalizable for diverse dance styles involving very pronounced movements, human body kinematics and energy profiles.},

abstract = {The promise of real-time detection and response to life-crippling diseases brought by the Implantable Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) has recently spurred substantial advances in implantable technologies. Yet, existing medical devices do not provide at once the miniaturized end-to-end body monitoring, wireless communication and remote powering capabilities to implement IIoMT applications. This paper fills the existing research gap by presenting U-Verse, the first FDA-compliant rechargeable IIoMT platform packing sensing, computation, communication, and recharging circuits into a penny-scale platform. Extensive experimental evaluation indicates that U-Verse (i) can be wirelessly recharged and can store energy several orders of magnitude more than state-of-theart capacity in tens of minutes; (ii) with one single charge, it can operate from few hours to several days. Finally, U-Verse is demonstrated through (i) a closed-loop application that sends data via ultrasounds through real porcine meat; and (ii) a real-time reconfigurable pacemaker.},

We extracted 139 papers on depression, anxiety and bipolar health issues from 10 years of SIGCHI conference proceedings. 72 of these were published in the last two years. A systematic analysis of this growing body of literature revealed that most innovation happens in automated diagnosis, and self-tracking, although there are innovative ideas in tangible interfaces. We noted an overemphasis on data production without consideration of how it leads to fruitful interventions. Moreover, we see a need to promote ethical practices for involvement of people living with affective disorders. Finally, although only 16 studies evaluate technologies in a clinical context, several forms of support and intervention illustrate how rich insights are gained from evaluations with real patients. Our findings highlight potential for growth in the design space of affective health technologies.},

abstract = {Telehealth is a healthcare service that relies on exchanging information from one place to another to improve a patient's health status. In this demonstration, we aim to provide similar benefits to instantly bringing a doctor in the field to provide the right treatment at the right time for time-sensitive injuries. We present a telehealth system called Teleconsultant that enables near real-time communication between paramedics and doctors via videos captured from wearable cameras, this is crucial in the acute situations when the paramedic needs immediate assistance from the remote doctor that could help saving patients' lives. Teleconsultant includes capturing the video through body cameras worn by the paramedics, we refer to this video as wearable video. The video is transmitted over a heterogeneous wireless network to the remote doctor. Along the network path, video is analyzed in real-time to: (1) enhance video quality (e.g., video stabilization), and (2) detect time-sensitive injuries (e.g., stroke) so that remote doctors can be alerted and prepared when patient arrives via ambulance to the hospital. We demonstrate an end-to-end system to enable streaming of wearable video from the incident site to the hospital using body cameras worn by paramedics. Additionally, we demonstrate a framework for in-stream processing of the wearable video and we show two real-time video processing functions: stroke detection, and video stabilization.},

abstract = {Singing songs can be an engaging and effective activity when learning a foreign language. In this paper, we describe a multi-language karaoke application called SLIONS: Singing and Listening to Improve Our Natural Speaking. When developing this application, we followed a user-centered design process which was informed by conducting interviews with domain experts, extensive usability testing, and reviewing existing gamified karaoke and language learning applications. The key feature of SLIONS is that we used automatic speech recognition (ASR) to provide students with personalized, granular feedback based on their singing pronunciation. We also provided multi-modal instruction: audio of music and singing tracks, video of a professional singer and translated text of lyrics to help students learn and master each song in the foreign language. To test the efficacy of SLIONS, we conducted a one-week pilot study with English and Chinese language learning students (N=15). The initial quantitative results show that our application can improve pronunciation and may improve vocabulary. In addition, the qualitative feedback from the students suggests that SLIONS is both fun to use and motivates students to practice speaking and singing in a foreign language.},

abstract = {Public media and researchers in different areas have recently focused on perhaps unexpected problems that derive from an excessive and frequent use of technology, giving rise to a new kind of psychological “digital” wellbeing. Such a novel and pressing topic has fostered, both in the academia and in the industry, the emergence of a variety of digital self-control tools allowing users to self-regulate their technology use through interventions like timers and lock-out mechanisms. While these emerging technologies for behavior change hold great promise to support people’s digital wellbeing, we still have a limited understanding of their real effectiveness, as well as of how to best design and evaluate them. Aiming to guide future research in this important domain, this article presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current work on tools for digital self-control. We surface motivations, strategies, design choices, and challenges that characterize the design, development, and evaluation of digital self-control tools. Furthermore, we estimate their overall effect size on reducing (unwanted) technology use through a meta-analysis. By discussing our findings, we provide insights on how to (i) overcome a limited perspective that exclusively focuses on technology overuse and self-monitoring tools, (ii) evaluate digital self-control tools through long-term studies and standardized measures, and (iii) bring ethics in the digital wellbeing discourse and deal with the business model of contemporary tech companies.},

Meditation takes practice and requires training, especially for novices, to learn mindfulness and emotion regulation. However, while face-to-face instructions can provide the best long-term results, many people cannot afford or schedule attendance at meditation classes. We present an automated conversational agent that acts as a virtual meditation coach that is interactive and adaptive to a user's breathing behavior, based on inputs from a respiration sensor in a meditation session. We designed and validated three interaction techniques based on the user's breathing. Results from two experimental studies demonstrate that users are highly receptive of the virtual coach technology, and appreciated the interactivity afforded by the respiration sensor. Participants also felt more relaxed when the meditation coach adapted the instructions to their breathing.},

Approximately 83% of the students in this class successfully completed the entire book within 14 hours, achieving a reading comprehension rate exceeding 86%. Their English book reviews received an average score of 76 points (out of 100 points), indicating an elevated level of engagement and interest in reading. Moreover, they exhibited a positive reception towards the ChatGPT assisted reading mode. In contrast, the paper book class, relying on conventional paper-based reading, exhibited differing results. Only 40.48% of these students managed to complete their readings within an average of 30 hours. Their reading comprehension rate stood at 63%, with English book review essays averaging 52 points. Remarkably, 59.52% of the students in paper book class abandoned the reading task due to inadequate vocabulary for comprehension and a lack of interest. The findings underscore the efficacy of ChatGPT for AI-assisted reading, which contributes to improved efficiency and comprehension among students engaging with English original novels. These results emphasize the potential for enhancing English language education in the Internet+ era through the integration of such technological tools.},

abstract = {Recent advances in pervasive Internet of Things technologies and edge computing have opened new avenues for development of ubiquitous health monitoring applications. Delivering an acceptable level of usability and accuracy for these healthcare Internet of Things applications requires optimization of both system-driven and data-driven aspects, which are typically done in a disjoint manner. Although decoupled optimization of these processes yields local optima at each level, synergistic coupling of the system and data levels can lead to a holistic solution opening new opportunities for optimization. In this article, we present an edge-assisted resource manager that dynamically controls the fidelity and duration of sensing w.r.t. changes in the patient’s activity and health state, thus fine-tuning the trade-off between energy efficiency and measurement accuracy. The cornerstone of our proposed solution is an intelligent low-latency real-time controller implemented at the edge layer that detects abnormalities in the patient’s condition and accordingly adjusts the sensing parameters of a reconfigurable wireless sensor node. We assess the efficiency of our proposed system via a case study of the photoplethysmography-based medical early warning score system. Our experiments on a real full hardware-software early warning score system reveal up to 49% power savings while maintaining the accuracy of the sensory data.},

Clinical evidence shows that depressive symptoms can be reduced through a behavior change method known as Behavioral Activation (BA). This paper presents MUBS; a smartphone-based system for BA, which specifically contributes a personalized content-based activity recommendation model using a unique list of validated activities. An 8-week feasibility study with 17 depressive patients provided detailed insight into how MUBS provided inspiration and motivation for planning and engaging in more pleasant activities, thereby facilitating the core components of BA. Based on this study, the paper discusses how recommender technology can be used in the design of mHealth technology for BA.},

abstract = {Influence Maximization (IM) is a classical combinatorial optimization problem, which can be widely used in mobile networks, social computing, and recommendation systems. It aims at selecting a small number of users such that maximizing the influence spread across the online social network. Because of its potential commercial and academic value, there are a lot of researchers focusing on studying the IM problem from different perspectives. The main challenge comes from the NP-hardness of the IM problem and #P-hardness of estimating the influence spread, thus traditional algorithms for overcoming them can be categorized into two classes: heuristic algorithms and approximation algorithms. However, there is no theoretical guarantee for heuristic algorithms, and the theoretical design is close to the limit. Therefore, it is almost impossible to further optimize and improve their performance. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, technologies based on Machine Learning (ML) have achieved remarkable achievements in many fields. In view of this, in recent years, a number of new methods have emerged to solve combinatorial optimization problems by using ML-based techniques. These methods have the advantages of fast solving speed and strong generalization ability to unknown graphs, which provide a brand-new direction for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Therefore, we abandon the traditional algorithms based on iterative search and review the recent development of ML-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning, to solve the IM problem and other variants in social networks. We focus on summarizing the relevant background knowledge, basic principles, common methods, and applied research. Finally, the challenges that need to be solved urgently in future IM research are pointed out.},

This paper presents a systematic review of AR- or VR-driven interventions for promoting healthy behaviors. The review investigates the design, implementations of the intervention, persuasive strategies, intervention platforms, underlying technologies, current trends, and research gaps. Our review of the past 10-years' work in the area reveals that 1) the considered papers focused on seven main healthy behaviors, where “alcohol use” emerged as the most commonly considered behavior; 2) trustworthiness emerged as the most commonly used persuasive strategy; 3) youth are the most targeted audience; 4) VR is more common than AR; and 5) most AR- or VR-driven interventions are perceived to be effective in motivating healthy behavior in people. We also uncover how they use Artificial Intelligence and Object Tracking in this space. Finally, we identify gaps and offer recommendations for advancing research in this area.},

We developed and piloted a data collection system in a clinical study that involved 25 heart failure patients recently discharged. The results demonstrated the feasibility of continuously monitoring outpatients using wristbands. We observed high levels of patient compliance in wearing the wristbands regularly and satisfactory yield, latency, and reliability of data collection from the wristbands to a cloud-based database. Finally, we explored a set of machine learning models to predict deterioration based on the Fitbit data. Through fivefold cross-validation, K nearest neighbor achieved the highest accuracy of 0.8667 for identifying patients at risk of deterioration using the data collected from the beginning of the monitoring. Machine learning models based on multimodal data (step, sleep, and heart rate) significantly outperformed the traditional clinical approach based on LACE index. Moreover, our proposed Weighted Samples One-Class SVM model with estimated confidence can reach high accuracy (0.9635) for predicting the deterioration using data collected within a sliding window, which indicates the potential for allowing timely intervention.},

The need for uniform framework is the felt need as various user-centric mobile services launched across rural markets. India becomes a field-testing ground for most of the multinational firms who want to test their innovative business models. This framework provides a testing method for socioeconomic development impact on rural areas. This study adopted socio economic criteria (SEC) used by Indian marketers as basis for sample selection.

abstract = {Second language (L2) English learners often find it difficult to improve their pronunciations due to the lack of expressive and personalized corrective feedback. In this paper, we present Pronunciation Teacher&nbsp;(PTeacher), a Computer-Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) system that provides personalized exaggerated audio-visual corrective feedback for mispronunciations. Though the effectiveness of exaggerated feedback has been demonstrated, it is still unclear how to define the appropriate degrees of exaggeration when interacting with individual learners. To fill in this gap, we interview 100 L2 English learners and 22 professional native teachers to understand their needs and experiences. Three critical metrics are proposed for both learners and teachers to identify the best exaggeration levels in both audio and visual modalities. Additionally, we incorporate the personalized dynamic feedback mechanism given the English proficiency of learners. Based on the obtained insights, a comprehensive interactive pronunciation training course is designed to help L2 learners rectify mispronunciations in a more perceptible, understandable, and discriminative manner. Extensive user studies demonstrate that our system significantly promotes the learners’ learning efficiency.},

abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents challenges in social interaction skill development, particularly in turn-taking. Digital interventions offer potential solutions for improving autistic children’s social skills but often lack addressing specific collaboration techniques. Therefore, we designed a prototype of a turn-taking collaborative tablet game, StarRescue, which encourages children’s distinct collaborative roles and interdependence while progressively enhancing sharing and mutual planning skills. We further conducted a controlled study with 32 autistic children to evaluate StarRescue’s usability and potential effectiveness in improving their social skills. Findings indicated that StarRescue has great potential to foster turn-taking skills and social communication skills (e.g., prompting, negotiation, task allocation) within the game and also extend beyond the game. Additionally, we discussed implications for future work, such as including parents as game spectators and understanding autistic children’s territory awareness in collaboration. Our study contributes a promising digital intervention for autistic children’s turn-taking social skill development via a scaffolding approach and valuable design implications for future research.},

abstract = {Adolescence is a period of intense transformation that requires social interactions and emotional support. When such support is not available, technology can offer a solution. We conducted a participatory design study with the aim of producing content recommendations for a supportive conversational agent (CA) for adolescents. Twenty teens between the ages of 12 to 18 were invited to converse about&nbsp;issues they were experiencing and offer conversational support to each other. Analysis of participants’ conversations revealed that stress was the most frequent problem participants would seek support for. Participant responses to each other's problems offered both cognitive and emotional support, including advice on changing one's behavior, seeking help from others, prioritizing one's wellbeing, and statements of unconditional emotional support, among others. The findings indicate that many of the observed conversational solutions can be programmed in a supportive CA to appeal to a large group of adolescents.},

abstract = {There exists a gap in terms of the signals provided by pacemakers (i.e., intracardiac electrogram (EGM)) and the signals doctors use (i.e., 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)) to diagnose abnormal rhythms. Therefore, the former, even if remotely transmitted, are not sufficient for doctors to provide a precise diagnosis, let alone make a timely intervention. To close this gap and make a heuristic step towards real-time critical intervention in instant response to irregular and infrequent ventricular rhythms, we propose a new framework dubbed RT-RCG to automatically search for (1) efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN) structures and then (2) corresponding accelerators, to enable Real-Time and high-quality Reconstruction of ECG signals from EGM signals. Specifically, RT-RCG proposes a new DNN search space tailored for ECG reconstruction from EGM signals and incorporates a differentiable acceleration search (DAS) engine to efficiently navigate over the large and discrete accelerator design space to generate optimized accelerators. Extensive experiments and ablation studies under various settings consistently validate the effectiveness of our RT-RCG. To the best of our knowledge, RT-RCG is the first to leverage neural architecture search (NAS) to simultaneously tackle both reconstruction efficacy and efficiency.},

People managing multiple chronic conditions face burdensome and complex treatment plans. Polypharmacy, the prescription of several drugs, is typical in this cohort, adding to the treatment burden and potentially resulting in dangerous drug interactions. The goal of our work is to design a medication management application for older people with multimorbidity, and those within their care ecosystem. In this paper we present findings from interviews and focus groups with 124 participants, including older adults, informal and formal carers, and healthcare professionals. We outline six design requirements and describe how our design process is grounded in a strong, theoretical behaviour change approach that will allow us to fully evaluate the effectiveness of our design for medication management for those with multimorbidity, supported by their care network.},

Analysis of the sequential behavior patterns in SDL and the relations with students’ academic performance could help to advance our understanding of SDL in theory and practice. In this study, we mined the behavioral sequences of self-directed extensive reading from students’ learning and self-directed behavioral logs using differential pattern mining technique. Furthermore, we built models to predict students’ academic performance using the conventional behavior frequency features and the behavior sequence features. Experimental results identified 14 sequential patterns of SDL behaviors in the high-performance student group. The prediction model revealed the importance of sequential patterns in SDL behavior, which was built with an acceptable AUC. These findings suggested that several SDL strategies in behavior contribute to students’ academic performance, such as analysis learning status before planning, planning before learning, monitoring after learning.},

Supporting the employees with digital tools that increase awareness of occupational sedentary behaviour can potentially change behaviour and reduce the negative health effects. However, such tools are only effective if they are widely accepted and perceived as minimally intrusive. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a StandUp! Dashboard that summarizes sedentary data from pervasive computing sources and is shown each time a new tab is opened on the web browser. This way the StandUp! Dashboard becomes a low intrusive software tool to increase awareness of occupational sedentariness. Three-phased design iterations with focus groups were used to finalize the StandUp! Dashboard design. The software was evaluated via two-fold study, combining a larger-scale survey and a pilot study. The findings show high user acceptance for such a software tool in the workplace, and define a prioritized set of features the tool should support but also user concerns that must be addressed for wider adoption.},

Findings from our field study show that tailored content and push-messages are considered the most important for persuading people to stop smoking.

abstract = {The nature of education and training have dramatically changed due in large part to the advancement of technology. These advancements require changes in the skillsets of the learner. Research and history have shown that continuing to hire talents to fill gaps of knowledge and ad-hoc fixes are not typically enough to keep up with rapid innovation and change. This conceptual paper provides an innovative conceptualization of how to capitalize on the value of emerging AI technologies for education and training. We propose a holistic approach to augment AI and human capabilities in a competency-based learning environment. We argue that to successfully create an AI-based augmented training system, the fit between the learning task and the AI technology as well as the human-AI augmentation must be considered. These areas are explained in the specific context of competency-based learning.},

abstract = {This study proposes an approach for emotion recognition in children with hearing impairments by utilizing physiological and facial cues and fusing them using machine learning techniques. The study is a part of a child-robot interaction project to support children with hearing impairments with affective applications in clinical setups and hospital environments and improve their social well-being. Physiological signals and facial expressions of children were collected and annotated by the collaborating psychologists as pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral, using the video recordings of the sessions. Both single and multimodal approaches are used to classify emotions using this data. The model trained using only facial expression features yielded a result of 43.67%. When only physiological data was used, the result increased to 58.68%. Finally, when the features of these two different modalities were fused in the feature layer, the accuracy further increased to 74.96% demonstrating that the multimodal approach for this data set has significantly improved the recognition of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral emotions in children with hearing impairments.},

abstract = {Mastering thousands of logographic characters, such as the Chinese hanzi or Japanese kanji, is a unique and daunting obstacle for many students of those languages. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of our component-focused hanzi learning game, Zen Hanzi, in addressing this issue. Zen Hanzi aims to assist Chinese as Foreign Language (CFL) learners in getting over some of the trickier aspects of hanzi, such as differentiating between similar-looking components. We describe our experimental game and provide a comparison study where 63 participants learned 10 complex hanzi using either our game or Quizlet, a flashcard app frequently used in Chinese courses. Results found that both groups had similar improvement on the hanzi recognition test, but the treatment group showed significantly better scores on the hanzi composition test (p&lt;0.004). Our work extends prior findings on the benefits of component awareness to beginner hanzi learners, as well as contributes a scalable design for component-focused logographic learning tools.},

In this paper, we report the results of a longitudinal study on AttentiveReview2, a multimodal intelligent tutoring system optimized for MOOC learning on unmodified mobile devices. AttentiveReview2 continuously monitors learners' physiological signals, facial expressions, and touch interactions during learning and recommends personalized review materials by predicting each learner's perceived difficulty on each learning topic. In a 3-week study involving 28 learners, we found that AttentiveReview2 on average improved learning gains by 21.8% in weekly tests. Follow-up analysis shows that multi-modal signals collected from the learning process can also benefit instructors by providing rich and fine-grained insights on the learning progress. Taking advantage of such signals also improves prediction accuracies in emotion and test scores when compared with clickstream analysis.},

Systems papers presented technologies that varied by how much they amplify human effort (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Interaction papers studied both individual and group interactions with learning technologies. Finally, student-centric study papers focused on modeling knowledge and on promoting global access and equity. We conclude by charting future research directions related to topics such as going beyond the MOOC hype cycle, axes of scale for systems, more immersive course experiences, learning on mobile devices, diversity in student personas, students as co-creators, and fostering better social connections amongst students.},

This research is believed to be the first attempt at time-killing detection, which leverages the fusion of phone-sensor and screenshot data. We collected nearly one million user-annotated screenshots from 36 Android users. Using this dataset, we built a deep-learning fusion model, which achieved a precision of 0.83 and an AUROC of 0.72. We further employed a two-stage clustering approach to separate users into four groups according to the patterns of their phone-usage behaviors, and then built a fusion model for each group. The performance of the four models, though diverse, yielded better average precision of 0.87 and AUROC of 0.76, and was superior to that of the general/unified model shared among all users. We investigated and discussed the features of the four time-killing behavior clusters that explain why the models’ performance differ.},

abstract = {We describe a methodology and a technology supporting an intervention carried out by Public Health England (PHE) to encourage physically inactive people (doing less than 30 minutes' physical activity per week) to initiate regular physical activity via 10 minutes of daily brisk walking. The intervention is designed to encourage the inclusion of short bouts of continuous brisk walking in everyday activities such as shopping or commuting. To this extent a behaviour change mobile application, Active 10, was developed and distributed freely for Android and iOS. The app was downloaded over 620,000 times and our server infrastructure has collected nearly a billion data points between March 2017 and January 2019. The paper describes the rationale for Active 10, the application supporting the intervention, the data architecture and the data collection approach. Then we discuss the complexity of developing a health tracking technology with such large number of users, producing a significant volume of data. Finally, we describe a preliminary data analysis, focussing on a cohort of 129,010 users who used the app for over 8 weeks: 73% of these users achieved less than ten minutes of brisk walking per day during the first week; by the end of the 8th week this subset of users showed, on average, a 10-fold increase in brisk walking. The most inactive section of the cohort, the 54% of users who showed virtually no brisk walking activity during week 1, seems to achieve the greatest proportional increase, and by the end of week 8 they appear to meet, on average, 10 minutes of continuous brisk walking per day. The increase is more evident within the 15% of the cohort who kept the app for over six months: on average a 12% increase in average activity was observed in this group with no sign of decline.},

abstract = {Building of an accurate predictive model of clinical time series for a patient is critical for understanding of the patient condition, its dynamics, and optimal patient management. Unfortunately, this process is not straightforward. First, patient-specific variations are typically large and population-based models derived or learned from many different patients are often unable to support accurate predictions for each individual patient. Moreover, time series observed for one patient at any point in time may be too short and insufficient to learn a high-quality patient-specific model just from the patient's own data. To address these problems we propose, develop and experiment with a new adaptive forecasting framework for building multivariate clinical time series models for a patient and for supporting patient-specific predictions. The framework relies on the adaptive model switching approach that at any point in time selects the most promising time series model out of the pool of many possible models, and consequently, combines advantages of the population, patient-specific and short-term individualized predictive models. We demonstrate that the adaptive model switching framework is very promising approach to support personalized time series prediction, and that it is able to outperform predictions based on pure population and patient-specific models, as well as, other patient-specific model adaptation strategies.},

Smartphone technology offers new possibilities to address physical activity promotion. For app-based interventions to have an impact, both the effectiveness and user appreciation of the app are important. In this paper, we explore the user appreciation of the Active2Gether intervention, which offers personalized coaching to increase physical activity levels in daily life. The results are compared to the evaluation of a simplified version of the Active2Gether app (in which no coaching messages are sent) and the Fitbit app. Overall, the results reveal that users of a physical activity app appreciate a coaching feature to be included (on top of self-monitoring functionalities), but are also critical of how it is implemented (in terms of the number and content of the messages). The results also show that it is important to find a balance in the number of messages sent: too many messages seem to be perceived as annoying, but on the other hand, such system-initiated user interaction seems to reduce dropout.},

abstract = {In this technology-based era, network-based systems are facing new cyber-attacks on daily bases. Traditional cybersecurity approaches are based on old threat-knowledge databases and need to be updated on a daily basis to stand against new generation of cyber-threats and protect underlying network-based systems. Along with updating threat-knowledge databases, there is a need for proper management and processing of data generated by sensitive real-time applications. In recent years, various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms have emerged as a useful resource to manage and exploit the generated data to extract meaningful information. If these platforms are properly utilized, then strong cybersecurity systems can be developed to protect the underlying network-based systems and support sensitive real-time applications. In this survey, we highlight various cyber-threats, real-life examples, and initiatives taken by various international organizations. We discuss various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms to process and analyze the generated data. We highlight various popular datasets introduced by well-known global organizations that can be used to train the representation learning algorithms to predict and detect threats. We also provide an in-depth analysis of research efforts based on representation learning algorithms made in recent years to protect the underlying network-based systems against current cyber-threats. Finally, we highlight various limitations and challenges in these efforts and available datasets that need to be considered when using them to build cybersecurity systems.},

To explore the implications that AI code generators have on introductory programming, we conducted a controlled experiment with 69 novices (ages 10-17). Learners worked on 45 Python code-authoring tasks, for which half of the learners had access to Codex, each followed by a code-modification task. Our results show that using Codex significantly increased code-authoring performance (1.15x increased completion rate and 1.8x higher scores) while not decreasing performance on manual code-modification tasks. Additionally, learners with access to Codex during the training phase performed slightly better on the evaluation post-tests conducted one week later, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of interest, learners with higher Scratch pre-test scores performed significantly better on retention post-tests, if they had prior access to Codex.},

abstract = {Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are envisioned to harness rich data on users' contexts. However, many JITAIs fall short in leveraging the value of the data while sculpting the interventions. Investigating the literature reveals a lack of user-centered design (UCD) methods in designing JITAIs. Our case study of applying a UCD process revealed that even without deploying a JITAI, UCD could uncover user interactions that inform critical design decisions of a JITAI's components. We reflect on our experiences engaging in a user-centered JITAI design process and urge the broader human-computer interaction (HCI) community to devise concrete design guidelines for JITAIs. We take the first step toward that goal by proposing a checklist of key design considerations for future JITAIs. Together, this case study contributes insights on applying UCD to the design of all components of a JITAI, which can help capture users' needs and provide actionable interventions.},

abstract = {US military veterans (USMVs) are a vulnerable population with an elevated risk of mental health issues and suicide. Peer support, especially through mobile technology, has proven effective in addressing mental health related challenges, but ensuring long-term engagement remains a concern. This study explores the opportunity of designing persuasive technology, particularly persuasive reminders, to enhance engagement in peer support interventions for veterans. We followed community-based participatory research with ten veterans to identify specific peer support processes that can benefit from persuasive reminders and to uncover the underlying community values and needs to guide design. The findings emphasize the importance of designing reminders that focus on personalized strategies, effective delivery of success stories, understanding motivation levels, careful language selection, actionable reminders, and mutual accountability. The study advocates context-specific design and highlights the need for a broader user-centered persuasion design perspective to cater to veterans’ unique needs.},

Specifically, we propose how SARs might augment or offer more pro-active assistance over existing technologies such as smartphone applications, computer software and fitness trackers also designed to tackle this issue. In addition, we present a series of design implications for such SARs based on therapists' expert knowledge and best practices extracted from our results.

abstract = {Weightlifting is easy to learn, but difficult to master. People who do weightlifting do it to improve their health, strengthen their muscles and build their physique. However, due to the complex and precise body positioning required, even experienced weightlifters require assistance in perfecting their technique. At the same time, the training requirements of the individual change over time, as they perfect and hone their craft. To help weightlifters achieve optimum personal performance, we designed Weight-Mate, a prototype wearable system for giving weightlifters of different skill levels personalized, precise and non-distracting immediate feedback on how to correct their current body positioning during deadlift training. By iterating Weight-Mate using cooperative usability testing (CUT) with weightlifters of different competencies with their coaches we designed a system that could adapt to individual physiology and training needs. The Weight-Mate sensor suit maps the lifter's body configuration against the ideal deadlift position throughout all stages of the life, as defined by their coach, and provides non-intrusive feedback to the lifter to correct their body position. Our formative evaluation with ten weightlifters shows that an adaptive approach to digital weight training offers great promise in assisting weight lifters of all levels to improve their technique, and hence improve the safety of the sport.},

abstract = {Learning analytics has become a robust research area in the last decade, as innovative analytic models of learning data have been created with the goal of enhancing teaching and learning. However, barriers to large scale adoption of such technologies in higher education still exist. In recent years, a strand of research has begun to investigate stakeholders' expectations of learning analytics, hoping to find ways to integrate the innovations into everyday teaching practices. For instance, studies have investigated instructors' ideas about how learning analytics might be helpful, as well as concerns about student data privacy. However, most studies have taken a general approach rather than considering instructors' day-to-day experiences. Using survey methods, we presented instructors with hypothetical scenarios of learning analytics in use across disciplines, class sizes, teaching activities, and types of student data. We asked for ratings of both usefulness and privacy concerns for each proposed teaching situation. Our respondents considered scenarios involving learning outcomes-related data (e.g. grades) to be more useful than those that involve student interactions (e.g. language, social activity). In contrast, privacy concerns were lower for outcomes-oriented scenarios than interactions-focused scenarios. An interesting new finding was a negative correlation of usefulness and privacy; we discuss this in the context of instructors' possible cost-benefit reasoning. We reflect on our findings with respect to future efforts in developing and fielding learning analytics tools.},

abstract = {Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a human-computer interface. The traditional best practices normally applied to User Experience (UX) design cannot easily be applied to chatbots, nor can conventional usability testing techniques guarantee accuracy. WeightMentor is a bespoke self-help motivational tool for weight loss maintenance. This study addresses the following four research questions: How usable is the WeightMentor chatbot, according to conventional usability methods?; To what extend will different conventional usability questionnaires correlate when evaluating chatbot usability?; And how do they correlate to a tailored chatbot usability survey score?; What is the optimum number of users required to identify chatbot usability issues?; How many task repetitions are required for a first-time chatbot users to reach optimum task performance (i.e. efficiency based on task completion times)? This paper describes the procedure for testing the WeightMentor chatbot, assesses correlation between typical usability testing metrics, and suggests that conventional wisdom on participant numbers for identifying usability issues may not apply to chatbots. The study design was a usability study. WeightMentor was tested using a pre-determined usability testing protocol, evaluating ease of task completion, unique usability errors and participant opinions on the chatbot (collected using usability questionnaires). WeightMentor usability scores were generally high, and correlation between questionnaires was strong. The optimum number of users for identifying chatbot usability errors was 26, which challenges previous research. Chatbot users reached optimum proficiency in tasks after just one repetition. Usability test outcomes confirm what is already known about chatbots - that they are highly usable (due to their simple interface and conversation-driven functionality) but conventional methods for assessing usability and user experience may not be as accurate when applied to chatbots.},

Although there are varieties of container orchestration frameworks, e.g., Kubernetes to provide high-reliable services for cloud infrastructure, providing real-time support at the containerized edge systems (CESs) remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose EdgeMan, a holistic edge service management framework for CESs, which consists of (1) a model-assisted event-driven lightweight online scheduling algorithm to provide request-level execution plans; (2) a bottleneck-metric-aware progressive resource allocation mechanism to improve resource efficiency. We then build a testbed that installed three containerized services with different latency sensitivities for concrete evaluation. Additionally, we adopt real-world data traces from Alibaba and Twitter for large-scale emulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the deadline miss ratio of time-sensitive services run with EdgeMan&nbsp;is reduced by 85.9%&nbsp;on average compared with that of existing methods in both industry and academia.},

We interviewed 13 therapists and 14 clients about their experiences tailoring and engaging in therapy homework. We identify criteria for tailoring homework, such as client skills, discomfort, and external barriers. We present how homework gets adapted, such as through changes in difficulty or by identifying alternatives. We discuss how technologies can better use client information for personalizing mental health interventions, such as adapting to client barriers, adjusting homework to these barriers, and creating a safer environment to support discomfort.},

abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) can predict academic performance. Yet, it is difficult for learners. The ability to self-regulate learning becomes even more important in emerging online learning settings. To support learners in developing their SRL, learning analytics (LA), which can improve learning practice by transforming the ways we support learning, is critical. This scoping review is based on the analysis of 54 papers on LA empirical research for SRL in online learning contexts published between 2011 and 2019. The research question is: What is the current state of the applications of learning analytics to measure and support students' SRL in online learning environments? The focus is on SRL phases, methods, forms of SRL support, evidence for LA and types of online learning settings. Zimmerman's model (2002) was used to examine SRL phases. The evidence about LA was examined in relation to four propositions: whether LA i) improve learning outcomes, ii) improve learning support and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) used ethically. Results showed most studies focused on SRL parts from the forethought and performance phase but much less focus on reflection. We found little evidence for LA that showed i) improvements in learning outcomes (20%), ii) improvements in learning support and teaching (22%). LA was also found iii) not used widely and iv) few studies (15%) approached research ethically. Overall, the findings show LA research was conducted mainly to measure rather than to support SRL. Thus, there is a critical need to exploit the LA support mechanisms further in order to ultimately use them to foster student SRL in online learning environments.},

Given the pervasiveness of cigarette smoking, high rates of relapse, and limitations of existing treatments, it is critical to explore new methods of relapse prevention. Our solution draws from acupuncture's global use in treating addiction and recent evidence that non-invasive TEAS can reduce the urge to smoke after exposure to a drug-related cue. Specifically, we have designed a device formed to four acupoints (LI4, PC8, PC6, and TH5) located on the wrist and hand, and programmed to deliver 5-15mA stimulation. Through a paired mobile application, individuals are simultaneously guided through an MBRP intervention to help them take control of their response to the trigger. Together, this system provides real-time relief from the urge to smoke so individuals can better engage with cognitive behavioral relapse prevention strategies in high risk moments.},

Our application delivers a food craving reduction intervention at the moment of need and allows users to track how often they successfully resisted cravings. Our craving reduction intervention is based on recent research that shows that food cravings can be reduced through imagery techniques. We conducted a week-long evaluation of our application, comparing the effectiveness of our application to a basic tracking application.

It is unclear what qualities of a chatbot most correspond to users’ expectations and preferences. Even though existing work has considered a wide range of aspects, some key components are still missing. For example, the role of chatbots’ ability to communicate with humans at the emotional level remains an open subject of study. Furthermore, these trait qualities are likely to cover several dimensions. It is crucial to understand how the different qualities relate and interact with each other and what the core aspects would be. For this purpose, we first designed an exploratory user study aimed at gaining a basic understanding of the desired qualities of chatbots with a special focus on their emotional intelligence. Using the findings from the first study, we constructed a model of the desired traits by carefully selecting a set of features. With the help of a large-scale survey and structural equation modeling, we further validated the model using data collected from the survey. The final outcome is called the PEACE model (Politeness, Entertainment, Attentive Curiosity, and Empathy). By analyzing the dependencies between the different PEACE constructs, we shed light on the importance of and interplay between the chatbots’ qualities and the effect of users’ attitudes and concerns on their expectations of the technology. Not only PEACE defines the key ingredients of the social qualities of a chatbot, it also helped us derive a set of design implications useful for the development of socially adequate and emotionally aware open-domain chatbots.},

We conducted weekly lab sessions that covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, CGI, SQL, ASP, and Flash programming. Each topic was covered over a period of one to three weeks and each topic was supported by 10 to 26 individual programming exercises. Four teaching assistants provided real-time support during the laboratory period. Answers to all exercises were accessible on-line so that no student would be needlessly delayed by any particular problem. In this paper we discuss the laboratory's design goals, topical content, and the students' performance, reactions, and suggestions for improvement.},

We created a user interface that addresses feedback at scale for a particular and important aspect of code quality: variable names. We built this user interface on top of an existing back-end that distinguishes variables by their behavior in the program. Therefore our interface not only allows teachers to comment on poor variable names, they can comment on names that mislead the reader about the variable's role in the program. We ran two user studies in which 10 teachers and 6 students created and received feedback, respectively. The interface helped teachers give personalized variable name feedback on thousands of student solutions from an edX introductory programming MOOC. In the second study, students composed solutions to the same programming assignments and immediately received personalized quizzes composed by teachers in the previous user study.},

In this paper, we investigate a new approach to detecting interviewer fabrication automatically. We instrument electronic data collection software to record logs of low-level behavioral data and show that supervised classification, when applied to features extracted from these logs, can identify interviewer fabrication with an accuracy of up to 96%. We show that even when interviewers know that our approach is being used, have some knowledge of how it works, and are incentivized to avoid detection, it can still achieve an accuracy of 86%. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach to a moderate amount of label noise and provide practical recommendations, based on empirical evidence, on how much data is needed for our approach to be effective.},

abstract = {Churches have historically played an important role in Black American communities, catalyzing the pursuit of aims such as social justice, community organization, and health promotion. However, researchers have rarely examined how technology can support an assets-based approach to these efforts, nor the implications of race, traditions, and history when creating such systems. Addressing this gap, we conducted research with two predominantly Black churches to explore health promotion design opportunities. We used photovoice, a research method where participants led their own data collection and analysis. Participants provided nuanced descriptions of the racial and ethnic identities of their communities, and how church history and aspirations for the future impacted these identities. Our findings characterize tensions between tradition and ‘modernization,’ implications for technology design, and the need for a temporal approach to understanding communities. We conclude with broader implications for studying the intersection of race and religion in community technology design.},

While most of the existing Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) solutions are tailor-made for specific learning tasks and sensors, the VIT addresses the data annotation for different types of learning tasks that can be captured with a customisable set of sensors in a flexible way. The VIT supports MMLA researchers in 1) triangulating multimodal data with video recordings; 2) segmenting the multimodal data into time-intervals and adding annotations to the time-intervals; 3) downloading the annotated dataset and using it for multimodal data analysis. The VIT is a crucial component that was so far missing in the available tools for MMLA research. By filling this gap we also identified an integrated workflow that characterises current MMLA research. We call this workflow the Multimodal Learning Analytics Pipeline, a toolkit for orchestration, the use and application of various MMLA tools.},

abstract = {Understanding in which circumstances office workers take rest breaks is important for delivering effective mobile notifications and make inferences about their daily lifestyle, e.g., whether they are active and/or have a sedentary life. Previous studies designed for office workers show the effectiveness of rest breaks for preventing work-related conditions. In this article, we propose a hybrid personalised model involving a kernel density estimation model and a generalised linear mixed model to model office workers’ available moments for rest breaks during working hours. We adopt the experience-based sampling method through which we collected office workers’ responses regarding their availability through a mobile application with contextual information extracted by means of the mobile phone sensors. The experiment lasted 10 workdays and involved 19 office workers with a total of 528 responses. Our results show that time, location, ringer mode, and activity are effective features for predicting office workers’ availability. Our method can address sparse sample issues for building individual predictive behavioural models based on limited and unbalanced data. In particular, the proposed method can be considered as a potential solution to the “cold-start problem,” i.e., the negative impact of the lack of individual data when a new application is installed.},

abstract = {Classic ways of gathering data on human behaviour are time-consuming, costly and are subject to limited participant pools. Crowdsourcing offers a reduction in operating costs and access to a diverse and large participant pool; however issues arise concerning low worker pay and questions about data quality. Gamification provides a motivation to participate, but also requires the development of specialized, research-question specific games that can be costly to produce. Our solution combines gamification and crowdsourcing in a smartphone-based system that emulates the popular Freemium model of play to motivate voluntary participation through in-game rewards, using a robust framework to study multiple unrelated research questions within the same system. We deployed our game on the Android store and compared it to a gamified laboratory version and a non-gamified laboratory version, and found that players who used the in-game rewards were motivated to do experimental tasks. There was no difference between the systems for performance on a motor task; however, performance on the cognitive task was worse for the crowdsourced game. We discuss options for improving performance on tasks requiring attention.},

abstract = {While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on students’ learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation, motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating learning constructs. Such efforts will advance our understanding of the potential of LADs to enhance learning outcomes and provide valuable insights for educators and researchers alike.},

To cope with language barriers between developers from different disciplines, the approach is presented as a guideline, illustrated with a case study.

Amidst the dominant patriarchal societal norms and potential isolations intrinsic to their role, these SAHMs establish a robust, cooperative digital environment, wherein maternal experiences, knowledge, and emotional backings are collectively shared and curated. Through a two-stage interview study, employing chatbot technology over 14 days with 18 participants, we unveiled how SAHMs engage in both tacit and explicit collaborative work within these chat groups, reclaiming their maternal identity and amplifying their parenting confidence. This exploration not only illuminates the critical role of technology in enhancing collaborative maternal work but also propels the discourse on how SAHMs navigate their distinctive needs within specific socio-cultural contexts through technological means. Consequently, this offers a foundational perspective towards crafting technological designs that are empathetically attuned to the lived experiences and needs of SAHMs in Taiwan.},

abstract = {Many pedagogical models in the field of learning analytics are implicit and do not overtly direct learner behavior. While this allows flexibility of use, this could also result in misaligned practice, and there are calls for more explicit pedagogical models in learning analytics. This paper presents an explicit pedagogical model, the Team and Self Diagnostic Learning (TSDL) framework, in the context of collaborative inquiry tasks. Key informing theories include experiential learning, collaborative learning, and the learning analytics process model. The framework was trialed through a teamwork competency awareness program for 14 year old students. A total of 272 students participated in the program. This paper foregrounds students' and teachers' evaluative accounts of the program. Findings reveal positive perceptions of the stages of the TSDL framework, despite identified challenges, which points to its potential usefulness for teaching and learning. The TSDL framework aims to provide theoretical clarity of the learning process, and foster alignment between learning analytics and the learning design. The current work provides trial outcomes of a teamwork competency awareness program that used dispositional analytics, and further efforts are underway to develop the discourse layer of the analytic engine. Future work will also be dedicated to application and refinement of the framework for other contexts and participants, both learners and teachers alike.},

abstract = {Personal informatics (PI) has become an area of significant research over the past decade, maturing into a sub-field that seeks to support people from many backgrounds and life contexts in collecting and finding value in their personal data. PI research includes a focus on people with chronic conditions as a monolithic group, but currently fails to distinguish the needs of people with motor disabilities (MD). To understand how current PI literature addresses those needs, we conducted a mapping review on PI publications engaged with people with MD. We report results from 50 publications identified in the ACM DL, Pubmed, JMIR, SCOPUS, and IEEE Xplore. Our analysis shows significant incompatibilities between the needs of individuals with MD and the ways that PI literature supports them. We also found inconsistencies in the ways that disability levels are reported, that PI literature for MD excludes non-health-related data domains, and an insufficient focus on PI tools' accessibility and usability for some MD users. In contrast with Epstein et al.'s [36] recent PI review, behavior change and habit awareness were the most common motivation in these publications. Finally, many of the reviewed articles reported involvement by caregivers, trainers, healthcare providers, and researchers across the PI stages. In addition to these insights, we provide recommendations for designing PI technology through a user-centric lens that will broaden the scope of PI and include people regardless of their motor abilities.},

As a first step towards contributing to research, I conducted a user study 120 people in an African community to understand what strategies could be used to support people take on positive mental health behaviors. Findings from this study were carefully mapped to their corresponding persuasive techniques including reduction, personalization, and tailoring, reminders, and social learning. Using these techniques, I show how mobile persuasive system interventions could be designed to encourage positive mental healthcare behaviors, and bring about healthier and happier lives.},

abstract = {Longitudinal agent-based interventions only work if people continue using them on a regular basis, thus identifying users who are at risk of disengaging from these applications is important for retention and efficacy. We develop machine learning models that predict long-term user engagement in three longitudinal virtual agent-based health interventions. We achieve accuracies of 74% to 90% in predicting user dropout in a given prediction period of the intervention based on the user's past interactions with the agent. Our models contain features related to session frequency and duration, health behavior, and user-agent dialogue content. We find that the features most predictive of dropout include number of user utterances, percent of user utterances that are questions, and the percent of user health behavior goals met during the observation period. Ramifications for the design of virtual agents for longitudinal applications are discussed.},

The guidelines are based on a review of research of feedback on writing as well as general theories of feedback.

abstract = {Typing on mobile devices is a common and complex task. The act of typing itself thereby encodes rich information, such as the typing method, the context it is performed in, and individual traits of the person typing. Researchers are increasingly using a selection or combination of experience sampling and passive sensing methods in real-world settings to examine typing behaviours. However, there is limited understanding of the effects these methods have on measures of input speed, typing behaviours, compliance, perceived trust and privacy. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs of everyday data collection methods. We contribute empirical results from a four-week field study (N=26). Here, participants contributed by transcribing, composing, passively having sentences analyzed and reflecting on their contributions. We present a tradeoff analysis of these data collection methods, discuss their impact on text-entry applications, and contribute a flexible research platform for in the wild text-entry studies.},

This discrepancy between numeric data and personal wellbeing perception may limit the effectiveness of personal informatics tools in encouraging meaningful engagement with one’s wellbeing. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between raw numeric metrics and users’ qualitative perceptions of wellbeing. In an online survey with n = 273 participants, we used step data from fitness trackers and compared three presentation formats: standard charts, qualitative descriptions generated by an LLM (Large Language Model), and a combination of both. Our findings reveal that users experienced more reflection, focused attention and reward when presented with the generated qualitative data compared to the standard charts alone. Our work demonstrates how automatically generated data descriptions can effectively complement numeric fitness data, fostering a richer, more reflective engagement with personal wellbeing information.},

abstract = {Learning musical instruments using online instructional videos has become increasingly prevalent. However, pre-recorded videos lack the instantaneous feedback and personal tailoring that human tutors provide. In addition, existing video navigations are not optimized for instrument learning, making the learning experience encumbered. Guided by our formative interviews with guitar players and prior literature, we designed Soloist, a mixed-initiative learning framework that automatically generates customizable curriculums from off-the-shelf guitar video lessons. Soloist takes raw videos as input and leverages deep-learning based audio processing to extract musical information. This back-end processing is used to provide an interactive visualization to support effective video navigation and real-time feedback on the user's performance, creating a guided learning experience. We demonstrate the capabilities and specific use-cases of Soloist within the domain of learning electric guitar solos using instructional YouTube videos. A remote user study, conducted to gather feedback from guitar players, shows encouraging results as the users unanimously preferred learning with Soloist over unconverted instructional videos.},

abstract = {The field of personal health informatics has received increasing attention within the CSCW and HCI communities as health tracking becomes more affordable, accessible, and pervasive. Chronic disease management, in particular, presents tremendous potential for intervention given patients' ability to now actively participate in their care through tracking. The focus on 'personal' in health informatics, however, obfuscates the role of other cultural and ecological factors that might shape health tracking behaviors, and important information from alternative sources could be ignored by virtue of being subjective, complex, or simply hard to collect. To dig deeper into these negative spaces that may go untracked, uncover potential sources of important health information, and more completely understand current tracking practices, we embarked on an interview study with patients with cardiac diseases in Bangalore, India. In this paper, we present these patients' current health management approaches that are culturally situated, identifying both motivations and barriers to tracking, their attitudes towards online information, as well as cultural and ecological influences on their perceptions of cardiac care. We then discuss the interplay between our findings and current notions of, and approaches towards, patient empowerment and datafication of health.},

abstract = {The rapid adoption of Smartphone devices has caused increasing security and privacy risks and breaches. Catching up with ever-evolving contemporary smartphone technology challenges leads older adults (aged 50+) to reduce or to abandon their use of mobile technology. To tackle this problem, we present AppMoD, a community-based approach that allows delegation of security and privacy decisions a trusted social connection, such as a family member or a close friend. The trusted social connection can assist in the appropriate decision or make it on behalf of the user. We implement the approach as an Android app and describe the results of three user studies (n=50 altogether), in which pairs of older adults and family members used the app in a controlled experiment. Using app anomalies as an ongoing case study, we show how delegation improves the accuracy of decisions made by older adults. Also, we show how combining decision-delegation with crowdsourcing can enhance the advice given and improve the decision-making process. Our results suggest that a community-based approach can improve the state of mobile security and privacy.},

abstract = {Multimodal interaction technologies have enabled new applications for training interpersonal skills such as public speaking. Various training paradigms have been proposed, most of them relying on some form of graphical feedback provided to the trainee in real-time during their training or after training using an after-action review tool. Another paradigm consists of using virtual characters to provide feedback through their behavior during simulated social interactions. Preliminary studies have started to explore the effectiveness of these different training paradigms; however, these have not investigated the impact of individual differences on which interaction paradigm is more efficient or motivating for different populations of users. In this article, we explore the impact of personality, public speaking anxiety, and immersive tendencies on the experiences of users training public speaking with an interactive virtual audience system providing realtime feedback through virtual audience behavior as well as delayed feedback with an after-action review tool. We found that these three factors impacted different output measures of user experience and user ratings of the system's quality.},

However, passive sensing often struggles with noisy data, ambiguous feedback and weak user agency over the device, whilst self-reporting relies on user-entered data which can be time consuming and cognitively demanding. To address these limitations, we explore a different approach, whereby individuals consciously actuate personal data capture and are in control of it at all times; yet, the interaction solely involves clicking a button, thus avoiding cognitive overload whilst supporting immediate reflection. We call this approach intentive computing. Through our initial investigations we found that conscious interactions cannot only provide real-time relief in anxiety management, but can also function as memory anchors irrespective of the content captured and even prior to data visualization.},

In this study, we aimed to deepen our understanding of disengagement in a mobile JIT intervention system. As a case study, we conducted a user study with college students (n = 54) for eight weeks to understand how disengagement appears over time and what factors influence user disengagement. Our findings reveal that personal traits, such as boredom proneness and self-control issues, are closely related to disengagement, with key factors including 1) boredom and habituation related to repetitive and monotonous JIT interventions, 2) inopportune alarm, 3) distrust for the JIT feedback mechanism, and 4) a lack of motivation due to low rewards. We provide theoretical and practical design guidelines for follow-up studies on JIT intervention system design.},

The potential of AI-driven tools in enhancing the learning experience, especially in programming, is immense. However, the scientific evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) used in Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) as an AI-Tutor remains largely unexplored. Therefore, there is a need to understand how students interact with such AI-Tutors and to analyze their experiences.In this paper, we conducted an exploratory case study by integrating the GPT-3.5-Turbo model as an AI-Tutor within the APAS Artemis. Through a combination of empirical data collection and an exploratory survey, we identified different user types based on their interaction patterns with the AI-Tutor. Additionally, the findings highlight advantages, such as timely feedback and scalability. However, challenges like generic responses and students' concerns about a learning progress inhibition when using the AI-Tutor were also evident. This research adds to the discourse on AI's role in education.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications.

abstract = {Gait rehabilitation is a critical aspect of post-stroke recovery, and emerging technologies such as virtual reality and wearables are playing a pivotal role in facilitating this process. However, despite the potential benefits, there is a significant gap in robot-based rehabilitative systems that facilitate repeated use by maintaining users' attention long-term. Our research aims to bridge this gap by creating a comprehensive system that utilizes different feedback types and robotic assistance to support users' gait rehabilitation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce GARRY (Gait Rehabilitation Robotic System), a new robotic system that provides interactive feedback during locomotor training. It promotes engagement by gamifying the rehabilitation process, offering a fun means for the user to meet their rehabilitation goals defined and set by physical therapists. GARRY also incorporates behavioral feedback to introduce a sense of companionship during a session. We make GARRY open-source to other researchers in hopes of encouraging accessibility and to promote research in the field. Our code can be found here: https://github.com/UCSD-RHC-Lab/GARRY},

abstract = {Smartwatches have a large potential to support everyday activities. However, their potential as assistive technologies in inclusive academic environments is unclear. To investigate how smartwatches can support students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) to perform activities that require emotional and behavioral skills and involve communication, collaboration and planning, we implemented WELI. WELI (Wearable Life) is a wearable application designed to assist young adults with IDDs attending a postsecondary education program. This paper reports on the user-centric design process adopted in the development of WELI, and describes how smartwatches can assist students with IDDs in special education. The results reported are drawn from 8 user studies with 58 participants in total. WELI features include behavioral intervention, mood regulation, reminders, checklists, surveys and rewards. Results indicate that several considerations must be taken into account when designing for students with IDD, and that overall the students are enthusiastic about adopting an innovative smartwatch application in class, as they reacted positively about the technology and features provided.},

abstract = {An IoT device today can be managed through different channels, e.g., by its device manufacturer's app, or third-party channels such as Apple's Home app, or a smart speaker. Supporting each channel is a management framework integrated in the device and provided by different parties. For example, a device that integrates Apple HomeKit framework can be managed by Apple Home app. We call the management framework of this kind, including all its device- and cloud-side components, a device management channel (DMC). 4 third-party DMCs are widely integrated in today's IoT devices along with the device manufacturer's own DMC: HomeKit, Zigbee/Z-Wave compatible DMC, and smart-speaker Seamless DMC. Each of these DMCs is a standalone system that has full mandate on the device; however, if their security policies and control are not aligned, consequences can be serious, allowing a malicious user to utilize one DMC to bypass the security control imposed by the device owner on another DMC. We call such a problem Chaotic Device Management (Codema).This paper presents the first systematic study on Codema, based on a new model-guided approach. We purchased and analyzed 14 top-rated IoT devices and their integration and management of multiple DMCs. We found that Codema is both general and fundamental: these DMCs are generally not designed to coordinate with each other for security policies and control. The Codema problems enable the adversary to practically gain unauthorized access to sensitive devices (e.g., locks, garage doors, etc.). We reported our findings to affected parties (e.g., Apple, August, Philips Hue, ismartgate, Abode), which all acknowledged their importance. To mitigate this new threat, we designed and implemented CGuard, a new access control framework that device manufacturers can easily integrate into their IoT devices to protect end users. Our evaluation shows that CGuard is highly usable and acceptable to users, easy to adopt by manufacturers, and efficient and effective in security control.},

However, while existing literature investigated reactive support, this paper examines proactive support for mobile safety. To predict moments that users need support, we conducted a user study to measure the severity of mobile scenarios (n=300) and users' attitudes toward receiving support in a specific interaction around safety on a mobile device (n=150). We compared classification methods and showed that the random forest method produces better performance than other regression models. We show that user anxiety, openness to social support, self-efficacy, and security awareness are important factors to predict willingness to receive support. We also explore various age variations in the training sample on moments users need support prediction. We find that training on the youngest population produces inferior results for older adults, and training on the aging population produces poor outcomes for young adults. We illustrate that the composition of age can affect how the sample impacts model performance. We conclude the paper by discussing how our findings can be used to design feasible proactive support applications to provide support at the right moment.},

These two extremes of interactive surfaces are increasingly popular, but feature different characteristics-display and input modalities, personal/public use, performance, and portability. In this paper, we first identify possible roles for both devices and the interplay between them through an example scenario. We then propose a conceptual framework to enable analysts to explore data items, track interaction histories, and alter visualization configurations through mechanisms using both devices in combination. We validate an implementation of our framework through a formative evaluation and a user study. The results show that this device combination, compared to just a large display, allows users to develop complex insights more fluidly by leveraging the roles of the two devices. Finally, we report on the interaction patterns and interplay between the devices for visual exploration as observed during our study.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose Auracle, a wearable earpiece that can automatically recognize eating behavior. More specifically, in free-living conditions, we can recognize when and for how long a person is eating. Using an off-the-shelf contact microphone placed behind the ear, Auracle captures the sound of a person chewing as it passes through the bone and tissue of the head. This audio data is then processed by a custom analog/digital circuit board. To ensure reliable (yet comfortable) contact between microphone and skin, all hardware components are incorporated into a 3D-printed behind-the-head framework. We collected field data with 14 participants for 32 hours in free-living conditions and additional eating data with 10 participants for 2 hours in a laboratory setting. We achieved accuracy exceeding 92.8% and F1 score exceeding 77.5% for eating detection. Moreover, Auracle successfully detected 20-24 eating episodes (depending on the metrics) out of 26 in free-living conditions. We demonstrate that our custom device could sense, process, and classify audio data in real time. Additionally, we estimate Auracle can last 28.1 hours with a 110 mAh battery while communicating its observations of eating behavior to a smartphone over Bluetooth.},

We then conducted an open-ended survey with 788 undergraduate students and follow-up interviews with students and clinical psychologists to understand how people perceived these messages and the factors they anticipated would drive their engagement. We leveraged those insights to revise our messages, after which we deployed our messages via a technology probe to 11 students for two weeks. Through our mixed-methods approach, we highlight challenges and opportunities for future text messaging services, such as the importance of concrete suggestions and flexible pre-scheduled message timing.},

Based on the strong literature on the psychological effects of self-voice, we developed a voice alarm system that reminds users of daily tasks to support their consistent task completion. Over the course of 14 days, participants (N = 63) were asked to complete daily vocabulary tasks when reminded by an alarm (i.e., self-voice vs. other-voice vs. beep sound alarm). The self-voice alarm elicited higher alertness and uncomfortable feelings while fostering more days of task completion and repetition compared to the beep sound alarm. Both self-voice and other-voice alarms increased users’ perceived usefulness of the alarm system. Leveraging both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we provide a practical guideline for designing voice alarm systems that will foster users’ behavioral changes to achieve daily goals.},

However, identifying potential harms that may arise from AI applications remains a challenge, particularly during prompt-based prototyping. To address this, we present Farsight, a novel in situ interactive tool that helps people identify potential harms from the AI applications they are prototyping. Based on a user’s prompt, Farsight highlights news articles about relevant AI incidents and allows users to explore and edit LLM-generated use cases, stakeholders, and harms. We report design insights from a co-design study with 10 AI prototypers and findings from a user study with 42 AI prototypers. After using Farsight, AI prototypers in our user study are better able to independently identify potential harms associated with a prompt and find our tool more useful and usable than existing resources. Their qualitative feedback also highlights that Farsight encourages them to focus on end-users and think beyond immediate harms. We discuss these findings and reflect on their implications for designing AI prototyping experiences that meaningfully engage with AI harms.

The interactive visualizations enabled the therapist to strategically order and emphasize information to support patients' understanding of their health.

Following review by moderators, stories are published on a website and social media sites, and can also be browsed interactively using the WhatsApp bot. This multi-way, intermediated model of communication expands the scope and functionality of typical WhatsApp groups while offering significant cost savings relative to IVR systems.

abstract = {The Bayesian information gain (BIG) framework has garnered significant interest as an interaction method for predicting a user’s intended target based on a user’s input. However, the BIG framework is constrained to goal-oriented cases, which renders it difficult to support changing goal-oriented cases such as design exploration. During the design exploration process, the design direction is often undefined and may vary over time. The designer’s mental model specifying the design direction is sequentially updated through the information-retrieval process. Therefore, tracking the change point of a user’s goal is crucial for supporting an information exploration. We introduce the BIGexplore framework for changing goal-oriented cases. BIGexplore detects transitions in a user’s browsing behavior as well as the user’s next target. Furthermore, a user study on BIGexplore confirms that the computational cost is significantly reduced compared with the existing BIG framework, and it plausibly detects the point where the user changes goals.},

abstract = {Practical programming competencies are critical to the success in computer science (CS) education and go-to-market of fresh graduates. Acquiring the required level of skills is a long journey of discovery, trial and error, and optimization seeking through a broad range of programming activities that learners must perform themselves. It is not reasonable to consider that teachers could evaluate all attempts that the average learner should develop multiplied by the number of students enrolled in a course, much less in a timely, deep, and fair fashion. Unsurprisingly, exploring the formal structure of programs to automate the assessment of certain features has long been a hot topic among CS education practitioners. Assessing a program is considerably more complex than asserting its functional correctness, as the proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature over the past decades indicates. Program efficiency, behavior, and readability, among many other features, assessed either statically or dynamically, are now also relevant for automatic evaluation. The outcome of an evaluation evolved from the primordial Boolean values to information about errors and tips on how to advance, possibly taking into account similar solutions. This work surveys the state of the art in the automated assessment of CS assignments, focusing on the supported types of exercises, security measures adopted, testing techniques used, type of feedback produced, and the information they offer the teacher to understand and optimize learning. A new era of automated assessment, capitalizing on static analysis techniques and containerization, has been identified. Furthermore, this review presents several other findings from the conducted review, discusses the current challenges of the field, and proposes some future research directions.},

abstract = {Parental permission is required for medical care for children, and decisions may be made without incorporating children's views, even for adolescents. We explore the impact of including adolescents in virtual agent-based multiparty health counseling to promote Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The agent is designed to encourage HPV vaccination for children aged 9-12 by engaging co-present parent/adolescent dyads in an online interaction. Several techniques are incorporated, including HPV education, motivational interviewing, persuasion, modeling, and enablement, to address parents' intent to vaccinate their children. We conduct a between-subjects randomized study comparing a version of the agent exclusively for the parent, to one that includes the adolescent in the conversation and incorporates the child's views in counseling strategies. We measure pre- and post-intervention changes in intent to vaccinate, vaccination hesitancy, and knowledge in both the parent and the adolescent, hypothesizing greater improvements in these measures when the adolescent is included in the conversation. We also examine the satisfaction, engagement, and comfort of the parent/child interactions with the virtual agent. We found significant pre-post increases in parent intent to vaccinate their adolescent for both versions of the agent. Our work provides insights into the effectiveness of the virtual agent in promoting HPV vaccination, the impact of child participation on healthcare decision-making, and the user experience of multi-party interaction with the virtual agent.},

abstract = {Many important areas of behavior change, such as wellness or education, are frictionful; they require individuals to expend effort over a long period of time with little immediate gratification. Because of this, humans often act sub-optimally with respect to their stated long-term goal. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent can provide personalized behavioral interventions to correct human policies. The AI must personalize rapidly (before the individual has a chance to disengage) and interpretably, to aid our scientific understanding of the behavioral interventions. This work focuses on crafting small, interpretable models of the human that capture the mechanism behind the human agent's sub-optimal policies. These human models provide the AI with enough inductive bias to quickly learn intervention policies for each individual it encounters.},

Despite these formats having different levels of detail and requiring different composition processes, little research has related these compositional processes for the provider to the feedback perceptions and revision outcomes for the recipient. In an online experiment, we investigated how novice participants (N=285) revised short stories in response to expert feedback composed with four common processes: rubrics, open comments, rubrics with open comments, and rubrics with comments on each rubric item (per-criterion comments). We also surveyed the feedback providers (N=4) to contrast the costs of composing feedback with the benefits of that feedback for the recipients. We found rubrics with per-criterion comments led to the highest revision quality, providers believed rubrics with open comments were most helpful to recipients, and rubrics alone took the least time to compose. Recipients' revision quality and perceptions of feedback helpfulness and credibility increased with feedback detail. We contribute an emergent framework for selecting feedback composition techniques based on attributes of interest and insights linking the composition costs with the benefits of the resulting feedback.},

Narrative-based interventions have the potential to alleviate this burden by illustrating psychological principles in an applied context. In this work, we explore how stories can be delivered via the ubiquitous and scalable medium of text messaging. Through formative work consisting of interviews and focus group discussions with 15 participants, we identified desirable elements of stories about mental health, including authenticity and relatability. We then deployed story-based text messages to 42 participants to explore challenges regarding both the stories' content (e.g., specific versus generalized) and format (e.g., story length). We observed that our stories helped participants reflect on and identify flaws in their thinking patterns. Our findings highlight design implications and opportunities for mental wellness interventions that utilize stories in text messaging services.},

abstract = {StandUp Reports play an important role in capstone software engineering courses, facilitating progress tracking, obstacle identification, and team collaboration. However, despite their significance, students often grapple with the challenge of creating StandUp Reports that are clear, concise, and actionable. This paper investigates the impact of the use of generative AI in producing StandUp report recommendations, aiming to assist students in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of their reports. In a semester-long capstone course, 179 students participated in 16 real-world software development projects. They submitted weekly StandUp Reports with the assistance of an AI-powered Slack, which analyzed their initial reports and provided suggestions for enhancing them using both GPT-3.5 and the early access GPT-4 API. After each submitted report, students voluntarily answered a survey about usability and suggestion preference. Furthermore, we conducted a linguistic analysis of the recommendations made by the algorithms to gauge reading ease and comprehension complexity. Our findings indicate that the AI-based recommendation system helped students improve the overall quality of their StandUp Reports throughout the semester. Students expressed a high level of satisfaction with the tool and exhibited a strong willingness to continue using it in the future. The survey reveals that students perceived a slight improvement when using GPT-4 compared to GPT-3.5. Finally, a computational linguistic analysis performed on the recommendations demonstrates that both algorithms significantly improve the alignment between the generated texts and the students' educational level, thereby improving the quality of the original texts.},

In this paper we report on our findings from interviews with 15 dual income families, during a year-long deployment of an eco-feedback technology that attempted to inquire into the factors that prohibited its adoption. We found the non-adoption of our system to be rooted in a number of systemic failures, relating to the physical context, the families' social dynamics and the roles assumed by family members, as well as families' priorities and the non-negotiability of their routines. Motivated by prior work and our empirical findings we propose three distinct dimensions but also phases in the adoption of eco-feedback technologies: orientation, incorporation and social integration, and discuss how these may hint at different barriers in the adoption of eco-feedback technologies.},

abstract = {The promise of real-time detection and response to life-crippling diseases brought by the Implantable Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) has recently spurred substantial advances in implantable technologies. Yet, existing devices do not provide at once the miniaturized end-to-end sensing-computation-communication-recharging capabilities to implement IIoMT applications. This paper fills the existing research gap by presenting U-Verse, the first FDA-compliant rechargeable IIoMT platform packing sensing, computation, communication, and recharging circuits into a penny-scale platform. U-Verse uses a single miniaturized transducer for data exchange and for wireless charging. To predict U-Verse's performance, we (i) derive and experimentally validate a mathematical model of U-Verse's charging efficiency; and (ii) experimentally calculate the resistance-reactance parameters of our ultrasonic transducer and rectifying circuit. We design a matching circuit to maximize the amount of power transferred from the outside. We also go through the challenge of fabricating a full-fledged cm-scale printed circuit board (PCB) for U-Verse. Extensive experimental evaluation indicates that U-Verse (i) is able to recharge a 330mF and 15F energy storage unit - several orders of magnitude higher than existing work - respectively under 20 and 60 minutes at a depth of 5cm; (ii) achieves stored charge duration of up to 610 and 40 hours in case of battery and supercapacitor energy storage, respectively. Finally, U-Verse is demonstrated through (i) a closed-loop application where a periodic sensing/actuation task sends data via ultrasounds through real porcine meat; and (ii) a real-time reconfigurable pacemaker.},

To test the effects of ML-based support on students’ legal writing skills, we developed the intelligent writing support system LegalWriter. We evaluated the system’s effectiveness with 62 students. We showed that students who received intelligent writing support based on their errors wrote more structured and persuasive case solutions with a better quality of legal writing than the current benchmark. At the same time, our results demonstrated the positive effects on the students’ writing processes.},

The emergence of online social networks provides novel opportunities to obtain information about user behaviors, demographics and administer standardized surveys for studying such social and psychological phenomena in a data-driven manner. Using the data generated from a personality survey application on Facebook used by 228,343 users, this work undertakes a statistical validation of a frequently posited hypothesis: does a person's personality have any relation with their demographic information such as gender and date of birth (DOB)? Literature on astrology - though rarely scientifically tested - suggests that the one's personality is related to their sun sign which is derived from their DOB. Based on DOB we have categorized all users into 12 groups referred as 12 sun signs. We then examined the relationship between users' big five personality traits and their sun sign through Chi-square (χ2) test. Subsequently, the ordinal regression model is used to model this relationship. Our results suggest that there are certain personality traits which relate to DOB, making DOB a very quick indicator of one's personality where there exists a relationship. Interestingly, we also analyzed the impact of users' belief in sun signs and found that the degree of confidence increased for the users who believe in sun signs.},

Next, we tested two methods of teaching macronutrient assessment skills (Comparison and Decomposition) and analyzed their effectiveness.

However, the context in which the learning occurs is important for educational innovations to impact student learning. In particular, for student-facing learning analytics systems like feedback tools to work effectively, they have to be integrated with pedagogical approaches and the learning design. This paper proposes a conceptual model to strike a balance between the concepts of generalizable scalable support and contextualized specific support by clarifying key elements that help to contextualize student-facing learning analytics tools. We demonstrate an implementation of the model using a writing analytics example, where the features, feedback and learning activities around the automated writing feedback tool are tuned for the pedagogical context and the assessment regime in hand, by co-designing them with the subject experts. The model can be employed for learning analytics to move from generalized support to meaningful contextualized support for enhancing learning.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing}

In this scenario, the Linux kernel is emerging as a valuable solution on the software side, thanks to the rich support for hardware devices and peripherals, along with a well-established programming environment. However, Linux has been developed as a general-purpose operating system, followed by several approaches to introduce actual real-time capabilities in the kernel. Among these, the PREEMPT_RT patch, developed by the kernel maintainers, has the goal to increase the predictability and reduce the latencies of the kernel directly modifying the existent kernel code. This article aims at providing a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches for building real-time Linux-based systems, with a focus on PREEMPT_RT, its evolution, and the challenges that should be addressed in order to move PREEMPT_RT one step ahead. Finally, we present some applications and use cases that have already benefited from the introduction of this patch.},

abstract = {Academic analytics focuses on collecting, analysing and visualising educational data to generate institutional insights and improve decision-making for academic purposes. However, challenges that arise from navigating a complex organisational structure when introducing analytics systems have called for the need to engage key stakeholders widely to cultivate a shared vision and ensure that implemented systems create desired value. This paper presents a study that takes co-design steps to identify design needs and strategic approaches for the adoption of academic analytics, which serves the purpose of enhancing the measurement of educational quality utilising institutional data. Through semi-structured interviews with 54 educational stakeholders at a large research university, we identified particular interest in measuring student engagement and the performance of courses and programmes. Based on the observed perceptions and concerns regarding data use to measure or evaluate these areas, implications for adoption strategy of academic analytics, such as leadership involvement, communication, and training, are discussed.},

abstract = {Accurate real-time risk identification is vital to protecting social media users from online harm, which has driven research towards advancements in machine learning (ML). While strides have been made regarding the computational facets of algorithms for “real-time” risk detection, such research has not yet evaluated these advancements through a human-centered lens. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of 53 peer-reviewed articles on real-time risk detection on social media. Real-time detection was mainly operationalized as “early” detection after-the-fact based on pre-defined chunks of data and evaluated based on standard performance metrics, such as timeliness. We identified several human-centered opportunities for advancing current algorithms, such as integrating human insight in feature selection, algorithms’ improvement considering human behavior, and utilizing human evaluations. This work serves as a critical call-to-action for the HCI and ML communities to work together to protect social media users before, during, and after exposure to risks.},

abstract = {The automated evaluation of pain is critical for developing effective pain management approaches that seek to alleviate while preserving patients’ functioning. Transformer-based models can aid in detecting pain from Hindi text data gathered from social media by leveraging their ability to capture complex language patterns and contextual information. By understanding the nuances and context of Hindi text, transformer models can effectively identify linguistic cues, sentiment and expressions associated with pain enabling the detection and analysis of pain-related content present in social media posts. The purpose of this research is to analyse the feasibility of utilizing NLP techniques to automatically identify pain within Hindi textual data, providing a valuable tool for pain assessment in Hindi-speaking populations. The research showcases the HindiPainNet model, a deep neural network that employs the IndicBERT model, classifying the dataset into two class labels {pain, no_pain} for detecting pain in Hindi textual data. The model is trained and tested using a novel dataset, दर्द-ए-शायरी (pronounced as Dard-e-Shayari) curated using posts from social media platforms. The results demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an accuracy of 70.5%. This pioneer research highlights the potential of utilizing textual data from diverse sources to identify and understand pain experiences based on psychosocial factors. This research could pave the path for the development of automated pain assessment tools that help medical professionals comprehend and treat pain in Hindi speaking populations. Additionally, it opens avenues to conduct further NLP-based multilingual pain detection research, addressing the needs of diverse language communities.},

abstract = {Having lung cancer is associated with accessibility issues because people afflicted with lung cancer tend to be older and less familiar with technology, and have low education levels and low health literacy. Fear, embarrassment and stigmatization also play a role. This makes it difficult for people to access the information they need to understand and manage their illness, particularly in the time before the diagnosis. We can mitigate these disadvantages and bridge the accessibility gap by ensuring people at risk for lung cancer are informed about symptoms and when to seek medical advice. The Web is uniquely placed to fulfill this role. We therefore developed an online lung cancer symptom appraisal tool tailored towards people with low education levels and health literacy and based on psychological theory to target barriers like fear and embarrassment. At present we are conducting a feasibility study to assess whether it is possible to reach the high risk population and encourage early help-seeking. So far, 97 users have participated, 97.9% of which report symptoms and risk factors that indicate they should seek medical help. 34% report education levels below school leaving qualification. Our tool led to a significantly higher intention to seek medical help than the same information without theory-based components (p = 0.01). Our initial analyses suggest this is a suitable approach to widening health education to excluded groups.},

abstract = {As the prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows in various sectors, their potential in education warrants exploration. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BD) is closely associated with an increased risk of suicide. However, while the prior work has revealed valuable insight into understanding the behavior of BD patients on social media, little attention has been paid to developing a model that can predict the future suicidality of a BD patient. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-task learning model for predicting the future suicidality of BD patients by jointly learning current symptoms. We build a novel BD dataset clinically validated by psychiatrists, including 14 years of posts on bipolar-related subreddits written by 818 BD patients, along with the annotations of future suicidality and BD symptoms. We also suggest a temporal symptom-aware attention mechanism to determine which symptoms are the most influential for predicting future suicidality over time through a sequence of BD posts. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both BD symptom identification and future suicidality prediction tasks. In addition, the proposed temporal symptom-aware attention provides interpretable attention weights, helping clinicians to apprehend BD patients more comprehensively and to provide timely intervention by tracking mental state progression.},

We leveraged an existing gaze-based mind wandering detector that uses commercial off the shelf eye tracking to inform real-time interventions during learning with an Intelligent Tutoring System in real-world classrooms. The intervention strategies, co-designed with students and teachers, consisted of using student names, reiterating content, and asking questions, with the aim to reengage wandering minds and improve learning. After several rounds of iterative refinement, we tested our AALT in two classroom studies with 287 high-school students. We found that interventions successfully reoriented attention, and compared to two control conditions, reduced mind wandering, and improved retention (measured via a delayed assessment) for students with low prior-knowledge who occasionally (but not excessively) mind wandered. We discuss implications for developing gaze-based AALTs for real-world contexts.},

The goal of the review is to summarize the main results found in the literature and highlight areas that need further work. Despite the the large body of work on plagiarism, no systematic reviews have been published so far.The reviewed papers were categorized and analyzed using a theoretical framework from the field of Fraud Deterrence named the Fraud Triangle. According to this framework, fraudulent behavior occurs when the person is under pressure, perceives the availability of an opportunity to commit fraud, and rationalizes the fraudulent behavior in a way that makes it seem not unethical to him or her.The review found the largest amount of the reviewed papers to discuss ways for reducing the opportunity to plagiarize, as well as tools for detecting plagiarism. However, there is a clear lack of empirical work evaluating the deterrent efficacy of these strategies and tools. The reviewed papers also included mentions of a wide range of rationalizations used by computing students when justifying plagiarism, the most important of which are rationalizations that stem from confusion about what constitutes plagiarism. Finally, work on the relationship between pressure in computing courses and plagiarism was found to be very scarce and incommensurate with the significant contribution of this factor to plagiarism.},

abstract = {With the increasing use of online mediums, Internet-delivered psychological treatments (IDPs) are becoming an essential tool for improving mental disorders. Online-based health therapies can help a large segment of the population with little resource investment. The task is greatly complicated by the overlapping emotions for specific mental health. Early adoption of a deep learning system presented severe difficulties, including ethical and legal considerations that contributed to a lack of trust. Modern models required highly interpretable, intuitive explanations that humans could understand. To achieve this, we present a deep attention model based on fuzzy classification that uses the linguistic features of patient texts to build emotional lexicons. In medical applications, a diversified dataset generates work. Active learning techniques are used to extend fuzzy rules and the learned dataset gradually. From this, the model can gain a reduction in labeling efforts in mental health applications. In this way, difficulties such as the amount of vocabulary per class, method of generation, the source of data, and the baseline for human performance level can be solved. Moreover, this work illustrates fuzzy explainability by using weighted terms. The proposed method incorporates a subset of unstructured data into the set for training and uses a similarity-based approach. The approach then updates the model training using the new training points in the subsequent cycle of the active learning mechanism. The cycle is repeated until the optimal solution is found. At this point, all unlabeled text is converted into the set for training. The experimental results show that the emotion-based enhancement improves test accuracy and helps develop quality criteria. In the blind test, the bidirectional LSTM architecture with an attention mechanism and fuzzy classification achieved an F1 score of 0.89.},

abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated the use of socially assistive robotics (SAR) in a variety of operational contexts where facilitating human-robot interaction and building rapport depend on eliciting positive sensations. The fact that different people express and feel emotions in different ways presents a huge bias and makes it challenging to identify and differentiate between emotions, even with the aid of artificial intelligence techniques. This is one of the biggest challenges. Using objective rather than subjective indicators, such as biosignals, as emotional feature discriminators can close this gap. Previous studies investigated the use of EEG measurements to classify emotions in HRI by looking at a range of classification methods, such as the use of MLP models and global optimization algorithms applied to methods like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Deep Neural Network, applied to both raw and derived signal features (e.g., valence, arousal, PSD, etc.). This paper introduces a novel approach that employs a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) for topographic maps obtained from EEG. As far as we are aware, this method has not yet been researched in this area. The proposed model achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 99.2%, successfully distinguishing between positive and negative emotions and suggesting that the use of a transformation of EEG data into images may be a viable solution because it allows the use of more accurate classification models. The results of the presented model are consistent with the best state-of-the-art models.},

Supported by unprecedented publicity albeit based on an over-than-a decade-year-oldconcepts, MOOCs are currently facing the real challenges on their way to maturity: how does learning (should) happen in a MOOC? how does the process of educating thousands of students bundles with the use of educational material designed for classic studying models? In this paper we try to address current trends in the use of educational content by already deployed MOOCs using a general, ISO-based quality model designed for distance learning quality evaluation. A qualitative study of 11 MOOC courses reveals content usage patterns that imply a coherent, evolving strategy, yet a strategy still based on classic theories of distance education. The design of a Quality Reference Framework for the design and assessment of MOOCs is also briefly presented.},

However, these communities are sparsely distributed and distant from decision-making centres, which impedes rapid dissemination of climate-related information that could allow them to build resilience to climate impacts. Although smartphone adoption rates are low, mobile services are widespread across Somaliland, presenting opportunities for supporting communities through mobile technologies. We interviewed 30 Somali pastoralists to understand their climate information needs, access to technology, and the potential for technology support. We also conducted a focus group with four Somali development experts to explore the cultural context and possible impacts of different design choices. Our results highlight and explore tensions around different design directions, and suggest possible ways to mitigate these. Designing systems that navigate such considerations can contribute to much-needed climate resilience for pastoralist communities in Somaliland and beyond.},

abstract = {In the face of the new demands for college English teaching in the new era, it is imperative to build a network learning platform that supports blended learning. Currently, college English teaching faces challenges such as uneven English proficiency among students and varying levels of motivation. This paper addresses the current issues of limited resources and insufficient teacher-student interaction in college English teaching and proposes a solution based on the concept of blended learning. The platform adopts a B/S architecture, integrates a rich set of online teaching resources, and supports various self-learning methods such as video playback and document downloads. It also includes modules for online classrooms, providing diverse communication and interaction channels between teachers, students, and peers. The platform can also provide personalized recommendations based on each student's preferences. The system is implemented using technologies such as Java, MySQL, and SSH, and the trial results show that the platform achieves its goal of supporting blended learning. This platform expands the time and space for English learning, provides personalized online learning resources for students, promotes the application of blended learning in college English teaching, and is worthy of further promotion. Of course, there is also room for optimization in terms of mobile support and user experience.},

abstract = {Automated assessment tools are widely used as a means for providing formative feedback to undergraduate students in computer science courses while helping those courses simultaneously scale to meet student demand. While formative feedback is a laudable goal, we have observed many students trying to debug their solutions into existence using only the feedback given, while losing context of the learning goals intended by the course staff. In this paper, we detail two case studies from second and third-year undergraduate software engineering courses indicating that using only nudges about where students should focus their efforts can improve how they act on generated feedback. By carefully reasoning about errors uncovered by our automated assessment approaches, we have been able to create feedback for students that helps them to revisit the learning outcomes for the assignment or course. This approach has been applied to both multiple-choice feedback in an online quiz taking system and automated assessment of student programming tasks. We have found that student performance has not suffered and that students reflect positively about how they investigate automated assessment failures.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a chatbot framework that adopts a hybrid model which consists of a knowledge graph and a text similarity model. Based on this chatbot framework, we build HHH, an online question-and-answer (QA) Healthcare Helper system for answering complex medical questions. HHH maintains a knowledge graph constructed from medical data collected from the Internet. HHH also implements a novel text representation and similarity deep learning model, Hierarchical BiLSTM Attention Model (HBAM), to find the most similar question from a large QA dataset. We compare HBAM with other state-of-the-art language models such as bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and Manhattan LSTM Model (MaLSTM). We train and test the models with a subset of the Quora duplicate questions dataset in the medical area. The experimental results show that our model is able to achieve a superior performance than these existing methods.},

abstract = {Introductory computer science courses (i.e., CS1 and CS2) have seen high dropout and failure rates, and such common phenomenon still exists nationwide. Studies have shown that students with effective peer support networks have a better chance to success in CS1 and CS2. Unfortunately, it is hard for most students, especially lower division students, to form their own peer support networks. To help students build their peer support networks, instructors of CS1 and CS2 have to, with the help of pedagogical tools, provide a friendly learning environment to foster the interactions among students inside and outside of the classroom. This paper discusses the usage of PeerSpace, an integrated peer collaborative learning environment to help instructors achieve such goal. Comparative studies were conducted to measure the effectiveness of PeerSpace in helping students build their own peer support networks; and preliminary results are positive.},

abstract = {We present ShellOnYou, a new Computer Science education tool, and analyze its use with four successive student cohorts. Developed to help instructors manage numerous students, this web application offers auto-graded exercises to acquire practical knowledge of Unix-like operating systems from the command line. For each answer, and almost instantly, students receive a score and detailed feedback. This reactive and iterative process encourages students to resubmit answers and progressively expand their procedural knowledge. The tool can also deliver individualized statements, thereby allowing students to improve their skills by combining personal research and peer learning. As an online tool, ShellOnYou affords students access flexibility, and also easily fits in distance learning programs. We found it particularly useful when teaching students with heterogeneous Unix backgrounds. The tool is available on request. We placed four successive student cohorts in a learning situation involving this tool, and asked them to fill a survey at the end of the learning period. We combine qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze their answers to the survey. We attempt to characterize their acquisition of procedural knowledge and the building of group dynamics. Several dimensions emerge: the benefits of using the tool in a learning situation, the learning process iteration as a catalyst for renewed commitment, the tool's entertaining format and its scoring system as a motivation for regular studying, and the inherent customization of the learning pace.},

With Augmented Reality (AR) face filters, it becomes possible to literally change how one sees oneself or others. In this paper, we explore privately applied AR filters during online public speaking. Private means that these effects are only visible to the speaker. To investigate this possibly controversial concept, we conducted an online survey with 100 respondents to gather a diverse set of initial impressions, possible boundaries, and guidelines. Following this, we built a prototype of a private AR web-based video-calling application, and pilot-tested it with 16 participants to gain more in-depth insights. Based on our results, we outline key user perspectives and opportunities for the private application of AR face filters during online public speaking and discuss them in the context of previous literature on this topic.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to propose a short form of the Index of Learning Styles questionnaire for use in an adaptive learning system in the context of higher education. Learning Styles have been used as the basis for user-centered adaptive learning in numerous cases. Although the empirical evidence is still questionable, there are studies that have concluded that LS have an effect on education. Due to their wide usage in technology-enhanced adaptive learning systems, there is a demand for efficient ways to discover the learning styles of individuals. Questionnaires are useful in solving the cold start problem which these systems can encounter. The original Index of Learning Styles, based on the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model, consists of 44 dichotomous questions which are evenly split into four dimensions. This research paper advocates for a short version of the Index of Learning Styles with 20 questions, which includes five questions referring to each dimension. These questions were selected using Exhaustive Feature Selection and evaluating different models using cross-validation. After statistical analysis, we deem the results as adequate for the desired purpose and promising for practical use.

abstract = {Our study presents a new tool, Reputation Agent, to promote fairer reviews from requesters (employers or customers) on gig markets. Unfair reviews, created when requesters consider factors outside of a worker’s control, are known to plague gig workers and can result in lost job opportunities and even termination from the marketplace. Our tool leverages machine learning to implement an intelligent interface that: (1) uses deep learning to automatically detect when an individual has included unfair factors into her review (factors outside the worker’s control per the policies of the market); and (2) prompts the individual to reconsider her review if she has incorporated unfair factors. To study the effectiveness of Reputation Agent, we conducted a controlled experiment over different gig markets. Our experiment illustrates that across markets, Reputation Agent, in contrast with traditional approaches, motivates requesters to review gig workers’ performance more fairly. We discuss how tools that bring more transparency to employers about the policies of a gig market can help build empathy thus resulting in reasoned discussions around potential injustices towards workers generated by these interfaces. Our vision is that with tools that promote truth and transparency we can bring fairer treatment to gig workers.},

abstract = {Depression is common but under-treated in patients with cancer, despite being a major modifiable contributor to morbidity and early mortality. Integrating psychosocial care into cancer services through the team-based Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) model has been proven to be effective in improving patient outcomes in cancer centers. However, there is currently a gap in understanding the challenges that patients and their care team encounter in managing co-morbid cancer and depression in integrated psycho-oncology care settings. Our formative study examines the challenges and needs of CoCM in cancer settings with perspectives from patients, care managers, oncologists, psychiatrists, and administrators, with a focus on technology opportunities to support CoCM. We find that: (1) patients with co-morbid cancer and depression struggle to navigate between their cancer and psychosocial care journeys, and (2) conceptualizing co-morbidities as separate and independent care journeys is insufficient for characterizing this complex care context. We then propose the parallel journeys framework as a conceptual design framework for characterizing challenges that patients and their care team encounter when cancer and psychosocial care journeys interact. We use the challenges discovered through the lens of this framework to highlight and prioritize technology design opportunities for supporting whole-person care for patients with co-morbid cancer and depression.},

abstract = {We design and implement a personalized and automated physical activity coaching engine, PACE, which uses the Fogg’s behavioral model (FBM) to engage users in mini-conversation based coaching sessions. It is a chat-based nudge assistant that can boost (encourage) and sense (ask) the motivation, ability and propensity of users to walk and help them in achieving their step count targets, similar to a human coach. We demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of PACE by directly comparing to human coaches in a Wizard-of-Oz deployment study with 33 participants over 21 days. We tracked coach-participant conversations, step counts and qualitative survey feedback. Our findings indicate that the PACE framework strongly emulated human coaching with no significant differences in the overall number of active days, step count and engagement patterns. The qualitative user feedback suggests that PACE cultivated a coach-like experience, offering barrier resolution via motivational and educational support. We use traditional human-computer interaction approaches, to interrogate the conversational data and report positive PACE-participant interaction patterns with respect to addressal, disclosure, collaborative target settings, and reflexivity. As a post-hoc analysis, we annotated the conversation logs from the human coaching arm and trained machine learning (ML) models on these data sets to predict the next boost (AUC 0.73 ± 0.02) and sense (AUC 0.83 ± 0.01) action. In future, such ML-based models could be made increasingly personalized and adaptive based on user behaviors.},

abstract = {While easy patient access to laboratory test results is necessary for patient engagement in their healthcare, it is not sufficient to enable patients to thrive in this role ? they must be able to understand and act upon these data. In this study, we analyzed posts to an online health community (OHC) that contained a patient's laboratory test results. The objective was to understand the nature of patients' questions related to these data to gain insights into how to better support patients as they individually and collaboratively make sense of their data. We found that patients seek help on the OHC to understand and use their laboratory test results at multiple points in the medical care trajectory. Specifically, in the diagnosis phase, patients tend to be focused on comprehending their data, to be receiving emotionally charged results and, of course, to be engaging the OHC in naming their medical issues. In the treatment phase, patients are often using their laboratory test results to ask more focused questions to identify treatment options, to seek treatment guidance from peers, and to predict the likely course of their disease. Throughout both phases, individuals are highly engaged in the medical process and put in substantial effort to proactively prepare for their care and interactions with doctors. They enlist the OHC in these efforts for many reasons such as a lack of confidence in their doctor. We discuss how gaps in the provision of healthcare services lead to the significant work involved in managing the complex and dynamic interplay between OHCs and the healthcare system. We offer design recommendations both for technologies that provide patients with access to their medical records and for OHCs that will likely continue to play an important role in filling gaps in healthcare services.},

Using this taxonomy of technologies as a framework, we then summarize three technology-mediated management strategies that these technologies enable, including serving as community, episode, and information mediators. We argue that with a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of people's in situ technology use, we can identify research and design opportunities for designing human-centered technologies to help people manage mental health challenges more effectively.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT), entailing both domain-general and domain-specific skills, is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.},

Possible reasons may include not having enough time to incorporate the use of analytics, not being familiar enough with specific techniques to readily apply them, or not knowing how data can help shape a curriculum or the classroom experience altogether. Learning analytics is a problem-driven research field, where the domain problem -- the people involved, the subject matter, and the learning environment -- drives the techniques and the solutions that are used. From this perspective, we propose a new framework with a suite of pedagogical questions that can be addressed using data to support decisions made about the curriculum or classroom structure. In addition, we present a case study with 69 participants in a CS1 course as a way to demonstrate how some of these questions are addressed. Our ultimate goal is to improve the quality of the students' learning experience using an evidence-based approach.},

abstract = {Earlier research has investigated how educational social robots can influence learner motivation and learning outcomes as motivators instead of learning materials. This paper presents a scoping literature review of this body of work, focusing on the educational strategies used, and describing the range of approaches used to influence motivation and learning through social robots, not as learning tools but as motivators. Nineteen advanced studies are identified and described according to the components of the ARCS model (a motivation model dominant in robotics research): Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction. We summarized the measures used for motivation in the studies and relate these measures to the four ARCS model components. Finally, we analyzed the studies from the perspectives of sample groups, study type, and domain or subject. Our analyses suggested that beyond focusing on persuasive (educational) strategies that educational social robots can use to keep learners’ attention, researchers should also focus on the satisfaction component of motivation. Furthermore, future studies should examine long-term interactions, apply more rigor in using validated questionnaires, and combine qualitative and quantitative methods to understand not only the effects of these different approaches but also the reasons behind them.},

To this end, computer interfaces serve as valuable tools for training individuals to improve FER abilities, while also serving as tools for gathering labels to train FER machine learning datasets. However, existing tools have limitations on the scope and methods of training non-clinical populations and also on collecting labels for machines. In this study, we introduce Find the Bot!, an integrated game that effectively engages the general population to support not only human FER learning on spontaneous expressions but also the collection of reliable judgment-based labels. We incorporated design guidelines from gamification, education, and crowdsourcing literature to engage and motivate players. Our evaluation (N=59) shows that the game encourages players to learn emotional social norms on perceived facial expressions with a high agreement rate, facilitating effective FER learning and reliable label collection all while enjoying gameplay.},

In this paper, we harness techniques used in commercial games, and investigate how customizing self-representation in a novel digital exposure task for social anxiety influences the experience of social threat. In an online experiment with 200 participants, participants either customized their avatar or were assigned a predefined avatar. Participants then controlled the avatar through a virtual shop, where they had to solve a math problem, while a simulated audience within the virtual world observed them and negatively judged their performance. Our findings show that we can stimulate the fear of evaluation by others in our task, that fear is driven primarily by trait social anxiety, and that this relationship is strengthened for people higher in trait social anxiety. We provide new insights into the effects of customization in a novel therapeutic context, and embed the discussion of avatar customization into related work in social anxiety and human-computer interaction. ?},

The claims are wide in variety and aggressive in nature, linking a sedentary lifestyle with obesity and shortened lifespans [25]. Rather than enforcing an individual to perform a physical exercise for a predefined interval of time, we propose a design, implementation, and evaluation of a context aware health assistant system (called Step Up Life) that encourages a user to adopt a healthy life style by performing simple, and contextually suitable physical exercises. Step Up Life is a smart phone application which provides physical activity reminders to the user considering the practical constraints of the user by exploiting the context information like the user location, personal preferences, calendar events, time of the day and the weather [9]. A fully functional implementation of Step Up Life is evaluated by user studies.},

abstract = {Participating in physical activity (PA) is beneficial for adolescents' physical and mental development. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to design and evaluate interactive interventions to facilitate adolescents' PA. Despite the knowledge produced by this large number of studies, the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) still lacks a comprehensive set of guidelines to guide our design processes, help us make informed design decisions, as well as provide niche for innovation. This paper reports a systematic literature review of studies on technology-supported interventions in adolescents' PA. We reviewed 25 design related studies in HCI over the past 10 years, analyzing 1) the process phases of design practice, 2) the design requirements and related design decisions, and 3) how these phases and requirements are internally related to each other and what are their influence on design value. Our findings suggest four design phases with seven design requirements and its corresponding design decisions emerged in the process of design. Furthermore, we outline a framework to demonstrate the internal relations of design requirements. We generalize opportunities and challenges for supporting the aforementioned design decisions making, and implementing the findings for future design and research on technology-supported adolescents' PA.},

The design allows users to create food entries either via a traditional database lookup or a streamlined '+1' approach. 24 people used POND to create predefined food entries. We found people preferred different approaches to creating entries, which reflected their self-reported nutrition concerns. This supports an argument for rethinking traditional approaches to designing food diaries.},

The proposed device detects asymmetries in exercises involving the lower limbs, employing two slim insoles equipped with only three pressure sensors positioned along the foot, one on the heel and two in the front. The data collected by these sensors are wirelessly transmitted to a user-friendly interface, which serves as a guide, assisting users in achieving more balanced and symmetrical training, important for maintaining musculoskeletal health and enhancing overall physical well-being.

abstract = {We conducted a systematic literature review on automated grading and feedback tools for programming education. We analysed 121 research papers from 2017 to 2021 inclusive and categorised them based on skills assessed, approach, language paradigm, degree of automation, and evaluation techniques. Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages. Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions. However, these techniques’ feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution. Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability, or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness. Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed. In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools’ performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders. However, because the evaluation dataset is frequently unavailable, it is more difficult to reproduce results and compare tools to a collection of common assignments.},

This paper presents the results of automatically intervening on struggling students during programming exercises and offering peer feedback and tailored bonus exercises. To improve learning success, we do not want to abolish instructionally desired trial and error but reduce extensive struggle and demotivation. Therefore, we developed adaptive automatic just-in-time interventions to encourage students to ask for help if they require considerably more than average working time to solve an exercise. Additionally, we offered students bonus exercises tailored for their individual weaknesses. The approach was evaluated within a live course with over 5,000 active students via a survey and metrics gathered alongside. Results show that we can increase the call outs for help by up to 66% and lower the dwelling time until issuing action. Learnings from the experiments can further be used to pinpoint course material to be improved and tailor content to be audience specific.},

In a lab study (20 participants, 15 training sessions per participant, up to two weeks of training), we found that our experiment group instructed to imagine positive music, winning awards, and similar strategies, demonstrated significantly greater ability in activating asymmetry compared to our placebo and control groups. In our analysis, Joie demonstrates the ability for prefrontal asymmetries to be used as input to an affective BCI and builds upon prior work in this area. Training these asymmetries can teach mental strategies that have applications in mental health.},

Here, we explored a potential measure for inequitable teamwork drawing on data from a digital pedagogical tool designed to surface and disrupt such team behaviors. Students in a large, undergraduate business course completed seven surveys about team health (called team checks) at regular intervals throughout the term, providing information about team dynamics, contributions, and processes. The ways in which changes in students’ scores from team check to team check compared to the median changes for their team were used to identify the proportions of teams with outlier student scores. The results show that for every team size and team check item, the proportion of teams with outliers at the end of the term was smaller than at the beginning of the semester, indicating stabilization in how teammates evaluated their team experiences. In all but two cases, outlying students were not disproportionately likely to identify with historically marginalized groups based on gender or race/ethnicity. Thus, we did not broadly identify teamwork inequities in this specific context, but the method provides a basis for future studies about inequitable team behavior.},

Because game-based learning environments elicit a wide range of student affective states, affect-enhanced student modeling for game-based learning holds considerable promise. This paper introduces an affect-enhanced student modeling framework that leverages facial expression tracking for game-based learning. The affect-enhanced student modeling framework was used to generate predictive models of student learning and student engagement for students who interacted with CRYSTAL ISLAND, a game-based learning environment for microbiology education. Findings from the study reveal that the affect-enhanced student models significantly outperform baseline predictive student models that utilize the same gameplay traces but do not use facial expression tracking. The study also found that models based on individual facial action coding units are more effective than composite emotion models. The findings suggest that introducing facial expression tracking can improve the accuracy of student models, both for predicting student learning gains and also for predicting student engagement.},

Still, Black Americans can face unique challenges meeting dietary and physical activity requirements due to inequities in access and quality of care, environmental and local factors, and difficulties in changing individual health behaviors. Personal informatics and self-tracking tools are one way of increasing awareness of health behaviors to motivate behavior change. However, there are still gaps in knowledge about what encourages different users to engage with personal informatics tools over time, particularly when used in collaborative, community-health settings. This paper contributes a nuanced understanding of fifteen participants' reasons for engaging in an existing community-based health education and behavior change program that combines collaborative self-tracking with culturally relevant content and social engagement to motivate heart-healthy behaviors. We illustrate participants' positive and negative experiences engaging in self-tracking and collaborative tasks during the program. We also discuss how participants envision that integrating technology might support or hinder participant engagement and the work of deploying community-based public health interventions. Finally, we discuss design implications for culturally informed, community-based personal informatics tools that engage Black American's in heart-healthy activities.},

abstract = {Motivating children to learn is a major challenge in education. One way to inspire motivation to learn is through immersion. We combine the immersive potential of augmented reality (AR), narrative, and large language models (LLMs) to bridge fantasy with reality in a mobile application, Moon Story, that teaches elementary schoolers astronomy and environmental science. Our system also builds upon learning theories such as culturally-relevant pedagogy. Using our application, a child embarks on a journey inspired by Chinese mythology, engages in real-world AR activities, and converses with a fictional character powered by an LLM. We conducted a controlled experiment (N = 50) with two conditions: one using an LLM and one that was hard-coded. Both conditions resulted in learning gains, high engagement levels, and increased science learning motivation. Participants in the LLM condition also wrote more relevant answers. Finally, participants of both Chinese and non-Chinese heritage found the culturally-based narrative compelling.},

To investigate how low contributors differ from committed volunteers, we distributed a survey to members of the Old Weather project, followed by interviews with respondents selected according to a range of contribution levels. The studies reveal a complex relationship between motivations and contribution. Whilst high contributors were deeply engaged by social or competitive features, low contributors described a solitary experience of 'dabbling' in projects for short periods. Since the majority of participants exhibit this small-scale contribution pattern, there is great potential value in designing interfaces to tempt lone workers to complete 'just another page', or to lure early drop-outs back into participation. This includes breaking the work into components which can be tackled without a major commitment of time and effort, and providing feedback on the quality and value of these contributions.},

Multiple studies have identified the success of toll road PPP, but cultural factors have never discussed as factors that have an essential role in determining the success of PPP.

abstract = {Marking and feedback are essential features of teaching and learning, across the overwhelming majority of educational settings and contexts. However, it can take a great deal of time and effort for teachers to mark assessments, and to provide useful feedback to the students. Furthermore, it also creates a significant cognitive load on the assessors, especially in ensuring fairness and equity. Therefore, an alternative approach to marking called comparative judgement (CJ) has been proposed in the educational space. Inspired by the law of comparative judgment (LCJ). The key idea here is that the better submission between a pair will be identified by a suitably qualified or experienced assessor. This pairwise comparison for as many pairs as possible can then be used to rank all submissions. Studies suggest that CJ is highly reliable and accurate while making it quick for the teachers. Alternative studies have questioned this claim suggesting that the process can increase bias in the results as the same submission is shown many times to an assessor for increasing reliability. Additionally, studies have also found that CJ can result in the overall marking process taking longer than a more traditional method of marking as information about many pairs must be collected.There is a clear necessity to investigate the efficacy of alternative rating and ranking systems that do not require extensive data on every pair of submissions, to reduce the temporal and cognitive burden on assessors, and bias from observing the same submission repeatedly. In this paper, we investigate Elo, which has been extensively used in rating players in zero-sum games such as chess – for devising a ranking between submissions in a comparative judgement context. We experimented on a large-scale Twitter dataset on the topic of a recent major UK political event (“Brexit”, the UK's political exit from the European Union) to ask users which tweet they found funnier between a pair selected from ten tweets. Our analysis of the data reveals that the Elo rating is statistically significantly similar to the CJ ranking with a Kendall's tau score of 0.96 and a p-value of . We finish with an informed discussion regarding the potential wider application of this approach to a range of educational contexts.},

The curriculum raises awareness of the role of social identity in learning, emphasizes active learning within computer science, and provides preparation for technical code review. This article presents an overview of the MaGE Training curriculum where it has been used to train six cohorts of near-peer mentors and its impact on more than 500 students at a liberal arts college. While rapid growth in course enrollments has presented many challenges, results suggest that the MaGE curriculum has helped to address some of these challenges by maintaining high quality feedback to, and close interaction with, introductory students. Effectiveness is evidenced through increases in mentor self-efficacy, positive impact on student belongingness and continued enrollment, and reports of buffering the instructor workload. The flexibility of the curriculum is supported through a set of modules that can be engaged with via in-person discussions or viewed remotely. This enables easier adoption of the curriculum for use at other institutions.},

abstract = {Procrastination by students may lead to adverse outcomes such as a focus on completion rather than learning or even a failure to complete learning tasks. One common method for motivating students and reducing procrastination is to send reminders with hints and study strategies, but it's not clear if these messages are effective or when is the best time to send them. Randomized A/B comparisons could be used to try different reminders or alternative ideas about how best to get students to start work earlier and, crucially, to measure the impact of these interventions on behaviour. This paper describes an A/B comparison of reminder emails set in a large CS1 course at a research-focused North American university. We found evidence that the email interventions caused a higher proportion of students to attempt the online homework but did not see evidence that these particular emails got students to start early, irrespective of changes to the timing of the reminder. More broadly, these findings illustrate how to use A/B comparisons in educational settings to test ideas about how to help students, and demonstrate the value of using randomized A/B comparisons, even when evaluating actions that seem obviously beneficial, such as reminder emails.},

In this paper, we outline the potential for computing technologies to assist with all aspects of the experience of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, including recognizing the pre-trauma disposition for PTSD, identifying the symptoms, helping with diagnosis, and aiding in the treatment and assessment of treatment. The content of this paper is based upon an extensive review of the literature and our consultations with domain experts and therapists who treat PTSD. We outline a number of opportunities for computing technologies to play a role in improving the lives of those with PTSD as well as challenges for working in this space.

Current research focuses on prevention strategies, which aim to delay as much as possible the first symptoms from appearing. Common therapeutic strategies rely on participants regularly completing diverse tasks in a monotonous way, which may get tiresome as they become routine, tempting participants to drop out after a short time. According to the motivational outcomes of the strategic use of game design elements, gamification arises as an effective technique for user engagement in non-leisure contexts like healthcare and well-being. Therefore, in this work we present Preventive Neuro Health (PNH), a gamified crowdsourcing-inspired tool for cognitive impairment prevention of older adults that enables personalization both from clinical and engagement perspectives.},

abstract = {Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS), commonly referred to as drones, have become ubiquitous in many domains. Examples range from drones taking part in search-and-rescue operations to drones being used for delivering medical supplies or packages. As sUAS commonly exhibit safety-critical behavior, ensuring their safe operation has become a top priority. Thus, continuous and rigorous monitoring of sUAS at runtime is essential. However, sUAS generate vast amounts of data, for example, multi-variate time series which need to be analyzed to detect potential emerging issues. This poses a significant challenge, due to resource constraints imposed on the onboard computation capabilities of sUAS. To alleviate this problem, we introduce ADAM, a novel adaptive monitoring anomaly detection framework for sUAS. ADAM selectively monitors a subset of data streams, which serve as indicators of anomalous behavior. In the event of a raised alert, ADAM adjusts its monitoring strategy, enabling additional detectors and taking further mitigation actions. We evaluated the effectiveness of ADAM through simulations in Gazebo, analysis of real flight logs taken from sUAS forums, and tests with real drones. Results confirm that ADAM can enhance safety and efficiency of sUAS operations, by dynamically managing anomaly detection, reducing CPU and memory usage by up to 65%.},

In this paper, we explore in particular how information about a person's emotions can be communicated to the agent with means of non-verbal communication through tangible interfaces. The purpose is to explore how different individuals approach the task of designing their own tangible interfaces for communicating emotions with a digital companion, and the range of different preferences and expectations. Six participants were interviewed and created tangible prototypes during a co-creation workshop. The data was analysed using theories about human emotions and activity, and translated into a generic user model, an architecture for a multiagent system and interface design proposals. The results include increased understanding of how different individuals would like to express their emotions with tangible interfaces, and informed the design of the information models regarding representing emotions. The study illuminated the importance of personalisation of functionality and interface design to address the diversity among individuals, as well as the design of the adaptive behaviour of a digital companion. Future work includes further studies involving additional participants, the development of the stress management application and conducting user studies where prototypes are used in daily activities.},

Two user studies demonstrate the engagement and usefulness of DesignQuizzer compared with the baseline (reading reddit.com/r/UI_design).

abstract = {With millions of applications (apps) distributed through mobile markets, engaging and retaining end-users challenge Android developers to deliver a nearly perfect user experience. As mobile apps run in resource-limited devices, performance is a critical criterion for the quality of experience. Therefore, developers are expected to pay much attention to limit performance bad practices. On the one hand, many studies already identified such performance bad practices and showed that they can heavily impact app performance. Hence, many static analysers, a.k.a. linters, have been proposed to detect and fix these bad practices. On the other hand, other studies have shown that Android developers tend to deal with performance reactively and they rarely build on linters to detect and fix performance bad practices. In this paper, we therefore perform a qualitative study to investigate this gap between research and development community. In particular, we performed interviews with 14 experienced Android developers to identify the perceived benefits and constraints of using linters to identify performance bad practices in Android apps. Our observations can have a direct impact on developers and the research community. Specifically, we describe why and how developers leverage static source code analysers to improve the performance of their apps. On top of that, we bring to light important challenges faced by developers when it comes to adopting static analysis for performance purposes.},

However, widespread use of RFIDs as sensors requires significant instrumentation to deploy tethered readers, which limits usability in mobile settings. Our solution is WearID, a low-power wrist-worn backscatter reader that bridges this gap and allows ubiquitous sensing of interaction with tagged objects. Our end-to-end design includes innovations in hardware architecture to reduce power consumption and deal with wrist attenuation and blockage, as well as signal processing architecture to reliably detect grasping, touching, and other hand-based interactions. We show via exhaustive characterization that WearID is roughly 6\texttimes{} more power efficient than state-of-art commercial readers, provides 3D coverage of 30 to 50 cm around the wrist despite body blockage, and can be used to reliably detect hand-based interactions. We also open source the design of WearID with the hope that this can enable a range of new and unexplored applications of wearables.},

abstract = {Multi-modal classroom sensing systems can collect complex behaviors in the classroom at a scale and precision far greater than human observers to capture learning insights and provide personalized teaching feedback. As students are critical stakeholders in the adoption of smart classrooms for the improvement of teaching, open questions remain in understanding student perspectives on the use of their data to provide insights to instructors. We conducted a Speed Dating with storyboards study to explore student values and boundaries regarding the acceptance of classroom sensing systems in STEM college courses. We found that students have several emergent beliefs about teaching and learning that influence their views towards smart classroom technologies. Students also held contextual views on the boundaries of data use depending on the outcome. Our findings have implications for the design and communication of classroom sensing systems that reconcile student and instructor beliefs around teaching and learning.},

abstract = {Reducing energy consumption within buildings has been an active area of research in the past decade; more recently, there has been an increased influx of activity, motivated by a variety of issues including legislative, tax-related, as well as an increased awareness of energy-related issues. Energy usage both in commercial and residential buildings represents a significant portion of overall energy consumption; however, much of this may be categorized as waste, that is, energy usage that does not fulfil a definite purpose. In the past decade, the viability of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies has been demonstrated, leading to increased possibilities for novel services for building energy management. This development has resulted in numerous approaches being proposed for harnessing WSNs for energy management and conservation. This article surveys the state-of-the-art in building energy management systems. A generic architecture is proposed after which a detailed taxonomy of existing documented systems is presented. Gaps in the literature are highlighted and directions for future research identified.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for flexible teaching formats, particularly online education, as an alternative to traditional face-to-face (F2F) education. This study investigates the impact of teaching format (online vs. F2F) on secondary school students’ interest and engagement. We conducted an exploratory analysis of survey data from 16 workshops (F2F: 12, online: 4) held between January and December 2022, with 129 participants completing the survey (F2F: 76, online: 53, age: 10-16). All workshops covered the same learning topics, provided by online courses developed to raise interest in computer science (CS). Our findings show that the teaching format had a negligible effect on interest development. Still, students in the F2F setting showed higher engagement levels than those in the online setting. Additionally, an analysis of the effect of age indicates that younger students are more engaged in online settings than their older peers. We also found indications for longer-running programs having a greater effect on personal interest development compared to one-day programs. This paper discusses the results and identifies implications for teaching practice and future research. Overall, the study highlights the need to balance the advantages and limitations of both teaching formats and suggests potential strategies to improve online engagement.},

Culturally sensitive design of health technologies can be useful for motivating health behavior change, especially in underserved communities. Yet, designing culturally sensitive technologies requires careful consideration to identify appropriate approaches for tailoring applications to the needs of the target population. In the paper, we explore the relationship between user values and emotions for informing the design of a culturally sensitive heart health application for African Americans. We partner with members and local community advocates involved in an existing evidenced-based community heart health intervention to understand their values and explore implications for designing for positive emotional experiences in a future digital application. We contribute a discussion of emotional intentions important to the design of a future application and suggestions for designers of similar applications.},

abstract = {The possibility of leveraging technology to support children's learning in the real world is both appealing and technically challenging. We have been exploring factors in tangible games that may contribute to both learning and enjoyment with an eye toward technological feasibility and scalability. Previous research found that young children learned early physics principles better when interactively predicting and observing experimental comparisons on a physical earthquake table than when seeing a video of the same. Immersing children in the real world with computer vision-based feedback appears to evoke embodied cognition that enhances learning. In the current experiment, we replicated this intriguing result of the mere difference between observing the real world versus a flat-screen. Further, we explored whether a simple and scalable addition of physical control (such as shaking a tablet) would yield an increase in learning and enjoyment. Our 2x2 experiment found no evidence that adding simple forms of hands-on control enhances learning, while demonstrating a large impact of physical observation. A general implication for educational game design is that affording physical observation in the real world accompanied by interactive feedback may be more important than affording simple hands-on control on a tablet.},

abstract = {In this article, we show how a technology-mediated mental health therapy involving psycho-education, therapist moderators, and social networking can provide support for carers of young people with mental illness. This multi-faceted tool provides opportunities for users to adapt the system to their needs, leading us to refocus the goal of treatment adherence toward a relatively new phenomenon in HCI, concordance, which has not previously been examined in the HCI literature in relation to online mental-health tools. Concordance shares important links with the development of therapeutic alliance, which is centrally important to mental health therapy, and to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which informed our approach to design.We present a three-month user study, which provides initial encouraging support for both the suitability of concordance as a lens for viewing user engagement and the idea that users can develop a therapeutic alliance with an online support system. This latter result is surprising as the phenomenon of therapeutic alliance generally describes a relationship between client and (human) clinician. Therapeutic alliance has previously been explored for face-to-face groups, and between individuals and online systems, but not for online groups. We show how even automated system behavior can encourage engagement from users and contribute to alliance formation, if the non-human parts of an online system are interactive. We argue that a design approach involving peer/moderator support as well as automated feedback, and which takes account of SDT, can provide support for therapeutic alliance.},

abstract = {This paper explores the critical issue of driver drowsiness and its significant contribution to road accidents. A real-time drowsiness detection system that harnesses the power of computer vision and facial landmark recognition to enhance safety and prevent accidents in situations where drowsiness poses a significant risk, such as drowsy driving. This system combines various libraries and techniques, including Dlib for face detection and facial landmark identification and OpenCV for image processing. Its core functionality involves capturing video frames from a camera feed, locating faces within each frame, and then focusing on the eyes and eyebrows to assess the individual's level of alertness. This assessment is primarily based on the analysis of eye blinking patterns, with specific attention to the blink ratio, which serves as a key indicator. Depending on the calculated blink ratio, the system classifies the person's state into three distinct categories: "SLEEPING," "Drowsy," or "Active." These categories are conveyed to the user through real-time text overlays on the video feed, each represented by a specific color. The value of this project lies in its potential to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness, a major factor contributing to road accidents worldwide. By continuously monitoring and evaluating the individual's state of alertness, this system provides immediate feedback and intervention when drowsiness is detected, thus contributing to safer driving and potentially extending its applicability to other domains where alertness is critical, such as operating heavy machinery or monitoring individuals in critical work environments. Furthermore, this project offers a foundation for further development and integration with advanced technologies, potentially evolving into a comprehensive safety system with broader applications in areas where real-time alertness assessment is essential for reducing risks and enhancing overall safety.},

Prior studies show that chatbots have the potential of coaching users to learn different skills; however, several limitations of chatbot-based approaches remain. People may become disengaged from using chatbot-guided systems and fail to follow the guidance for complex tasks. In this paper, we design chatbots with (HC) and without (OC) human support to deliver guidance for people to practice journaling skills. We conducted a mixed-method study with 35 participants to investigate their actual interaction, perceived interaction, and the effects of interacting with the two chatbots. The participants were randomly assigned to use one of the chatbots for four weeks. Our results show that the HC participants followed the guidance more faithfully during journaling practices and perceived a significantly higher level of engagement and trust with the chatbot system than the OC participants. However, after finishing the journaling-skill training session, the OC participants were more willing to keep using the learned skills than the HC participants. Our work provides new insights into the design of integrating human support into chatbot-based interventions for delivering guidance.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) such as those offered by Coursera are popular ways for adults to gain important skills, advance their careers, and pursue their interests. Within these courses, students are often required to compose, submit, and peer review written essays, providing a valuable pedagogical experience for the student and a wealth of natural language data for the educational researcher. However, the scores provided by peers do not always reflect the actual quality of the text, generating questions about the reliability and validity of the scores. This study evaluates methods to increase the reliability of MOOC peer-review ratings through a series of validation tests on peer-reviewed essays. Reliability of reviewers was based on correlations between text length and essay quality. Raters were pruned based on score variance and the lexical diversity observed in their comments to create sub-sets of raters. Each subset was then used as training data to finetune distilBERT large language models to automatically score essay quality as a measure of validation. The accuracy of each language model for each subset was evaluated. We find that training language models on data subsets produced by more reliable raters based on a combination of score variance and lexical diversity produce more accurate essay scoring models. The approach developed in this study should allow for enhanced reliability of peer-reviewed scoring in MOOCS affording greater credibility within the systems.},

abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) studies the learning process in order to optimize learning opportunities for students. Although LA has quickly risen to prominence, there remain questions regarding the impact LA has made to date. To evaluate the extent that LA has impacted our understanding of learning and produced insights that have been translated to mainstream practice or contributed to theory, we reviewed the research published in 2011-2018 LAK conferences and Journal of Learning Analytics. The reviewed studies were coded according to five dimensions: study focus, data types, purpose, institutional setting, and scale of research and implementation. The coding and subsequent epistemic network analysis indicates that while LA research has developed in the areas of focus and sophistication of analyses, the impact on practice, theory and frameworks have been limited. We hypothesize that this finding is due to a continuing predominance of small-scale techno-centric exploratory studies that to date have not fully accounted for the multi-disciplinarity that comprises education. For the field to reach its potential in understanding and optimizing learning and learning environments, there must be a purposeful shift to move from exploratory models to more holistic and integrative systems-level research. This necessitates greater effort applied to understanding the research cycles that emerge when multiple knowledge domains coalesce into new fields of research.},

By replicating the survey conducted in other countries, in seven Brazilian HEIs, we found convergences both with Europe and LATAM, reinforcing the need for local diagnosis and indicating the risk of assuming a ”LATAM identity”. Our findings contribute to building a corpus of knowledge on stakeholders expectations with a contextualised comprehension of the gaps between ideal and predicted scenarios, which can inform institutional policies for LA implementation in Brazil.},

abstract = {Especially in developing regions, parents are rarely given a direct voice in the design of digital maternal and child health (MCH) interventions. Instead, MCH needs and requirements are driven by organizations and health workers. In this research, we engage with both rural and urban parents and community leaders to better understand their challenges and priorities for digital MCH and propose a parent-centered agenda for human-computer interaction research. This paper reports on the community-based, digital MCH priorities identified in our research, and describes how we approached community discourse and co-design of digital initiatives for these priorities, through parent-centered workshops with low-resource South African communities. Furthermore, we provide the parent-centered design opportunities and tensions we discovered for digital MCH in South African contexts, such as designing for local&nbsp;contexts and languages, designing for accessibility and connectedness, and highlighting the underdeveloped digital MCH niches. Finally, we highlight the importance of including facilitators for co-design workshops, such as using intermediaries and design cards.},

To this end, they are based on semantic languages for service descriptions and user-defined policies for driving the reactive behaviour. Autonomic actions are performed triggering ECA rules, stored in a knowledge base, whose actions impact on a WfMS management interface that allows for dynamic changes of the running process.},

abstract = {To influence user behaviors, Internet-based virtual humans (VH) have been used to deliver health interventions. However, Internet-based VH health interventions face challenges. The challenges can affect user perceptions of an Internet-based VH health intervention. In our work, we use an Internet-based VH health intervention to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We present design guidelines drawn from two studies. The two studies examined the influence of visual design and the influence of the information medium on user intentions to pursue more health information. In the first study, the analysis of the focus group (n=73 users) transcripts shows that the VH's visual realism, the VH's healthcare role, and the presence of a local healthcare provider's logo influenced user perceptions of the VH-based intervention's visual design. The findings from the focus groups were used to iterate the intervention and derive design guidelines. In the second study (n=1,400), the analysis of online surveys of users after the VH-based intervention showed that very few users focused on the VH's appearance. To influence the user intentions to pursue the health topic further, the results recommend the use of an animated VH to deliver health information compared to other mediums of information delivery, such as text. The design guidelines from the two studies can be used by developers to use VH-based interventions to influence users' intention to change behaviors.},

Social interactions is captured using Sociometric badges [17] and are visualized on mobile phones to promote behavioral change. Particularly in distributed collaborations, MM attempts to bridge the gap among the distributed groups by detecting and communicating social signals. In a study on brainstorming and problem solving meetings, MM had a significant effect on overlapping speaking time and interactivity level without distracting the subjects. The Sociometric badges were also able to detect dominant players in the group and measure their influence on other participants. Most interestingly, in groups with one or more dominant people, MM effectively reduced the dynamical difference between co-located and distributed collaboration as well as the behavioral difference between dominant and non-dominant people. Our system encourages change in group dynamics that may lead to higher performance and satisfaction. We envision that MM will be deployed in real-world organizations to improve interactions across various group collaboration contexts.},

abstract = {Writing from multiple sources is a commonly administered learning task across educational levels and disciplines. In this task, learners are instructed to comprehend information from source documents and integrate it into a coherent written composition to fulfil the assignment requirements. Even though educationally potent, multi-source writing tasks are considered challenging to many learners, in particular because many learners underuse monitoring and control, critical metacognitive processes for productive engagement in multi-source writing. To understand these processes, we conducted a laboratory study involving 44 university students. They engaged in multi-source writing task hosted in digital learning environment. Adding to previous research, we unobtrusively measured metacognitive processes using learners’ trace data collected via multiple data channels and in both writing and reading space of the multi-source writing task. We further investigated how these processes affect the quality of a written product, i.e., essay score. In the analysis, we utilised both automatically and human-generated essay score. The rating performance of the essay scoring algorithm was comparable to that of human raters. Our results largely support the theoretical assumptions that engagement in metacognitive monitoring and control benefits the quality of written product. Moreover, our results can inform the development of analytics-based tools that support student writing by making use of trace data and automated essay scoring.},

However, behavioral outcomes are dependent on adoption and sustained use of mobile-based interventions. Design approaches for engagement and feasibility of use in everyday life have been studied among the general population, especially to promote physical activity. In this paper, we discuss a design process that addresses additional barriers to adoption when the target population has symptoms, limitations, or needs resulting from a specific health condition. We designed a smartphone-based physical activity intervention for breast cancer survivors by combining behavior change theory with empirical evidence. In a preliminary evaluation, participants found the application engaging and useful, and continued to use the application briefly after the evaluation ended. We illustrate how our design process was used, and could be applied to other specific health conditions.},

abstract = {Colonic and gastric cancers are the second and third most frequent causes of cancer-related deaths in Japan. Surveillance endoscopy plays an important role in the early detection of such occurrences. Explanations of endoscopy are repetitive and require extensive labor effort; hence, substituting manual explanations with information technology could assist in reducing medical staff workloads. As part of an implementation science study, we designed and developed a rule-based Chatbot system to assist in real-life endoscopy explanations in Japan. We employed a LINE official account to develop the system consisting of educational video materials created by VYOND animation software. Conceived, designed, and developed by endoscopists, the team used mixed methods to assess the Chatbot system's usability, engaging with interdisciplinary medical staff and patient users. The designed Chatbot system features eight video materials, all of which were developed in accordance with both hospital and national endoscopy procedures. The medical staff groups agreed on the correct content and potential usability of the system. The Chatbot system received an average System Usability Scale score of 90 from external user evaluators. As of December 2023, the Chatbot system has been implemented in a real-world hospital in Japan for more than 6 months. The system has recorded support for more than 700 patients who needed to undergo gastroscopy/colonoscopy operations, and no adverse events were reported.

As scene composition and camera parameters play a vital role in aesthetics of a captured image, the proposed method addresses the problem of learning photographic composition and camera parameters. Further, we observe that context is an important factor from a photography perspective, we therefore augment the learning with associated contextual information. The proposed method utilizes publicly available photographs along with social media cues and associated metainformation in photography learning. We define context features based on factors such as time, geolocation, environmental conditions and type of image, which have an impact on photography. We also propose the idea of computing the photographic composition basis, eigenrules and baserules, to support our composition learning. The proposed system can be used to provide feedback to the user regarding scene composition and camera parameters while the scene is being captured. It can also recommend position in the frame where people should stand for better composition. Moreover, it also provides camera motion guidance for pan, tilt and zoom to the user for improving scene composition.},

abstract = {Designers are increasingly leveraging online crowds; yet, online contributors may lack the expertise, context, and sensitivity to provide effective critique. Rubrics help feedback providers but require domain experts to write them and may not generalize across design domains. This paper introduces and tests a novel semi-automated method to support feedback providers by analyzing feedback language. In our first study, 52 students from two design courses created design solutions and received feedback from 176 online providers. Instructors, students, and crowd contributors rated the helpfulness of each feedback response. From this data, an algorithm extracted a set of natural language features (e.g., specificity, sentiment etc.) that correlated with the ratings. The features accurately predicted the ratings and remained stable across different raters and design solutions. Based on these features, we produced a critique style guide with feedback examples - automatically selected for each feature - to help providers revise their feedback through self-assessment. In a second study, we tested the validity of the guide through a between-subjects experiment (n=50). Providers wrote feedback on design solutions with or without the guide. Providers generated feedback with higher perceived helpfulness when using our style-based guidance.},

Our results reveal that people's gamification user types play significant roles in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies. People scoring high in the 'player' user type tend to be motivated by competition, comparison, cooperation, and reward while 'disruptors' are likely to be demotivated by punishment, goal-setting, simulation, and self-monitoring. 'Socialisers' could be motivated using any of the strategies; they are the most responsive to persuasion overall. Finally, we contribute to CHI research and practice by offering design guidelines for tailoring persuasive gameful systems to each gamification user type.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on building personalized player models solely from player behavior in the context of adaptive games. We present two main contributions: The first is a novel approach to player modeling based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). This approach addresses, at the same time and in a principled way, both the problem of collecting data to model the characteristics of interest for the current player and the problem of adapting the interactive experience based on this model. Second, we present an approach to evaluating and fine-tuning these algorithms prior to generating data in a user study. This is an important problem, because conducting user studies is an expensive and labor-intensive process; therefore, an ability to evaluate the algorithms beforehand can save a significant amount of resources. We evaluate our approach in the context of modeling players’ social comparison orientation (SCO) and present empirical results from both simulations and real players.},

abstract = {Learning analytics has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the healthcare field. This area of research offers valuable insights to educators, students, and researchers to enhance the quality of education. One area of focus in learning analytics is how stakeholders provide feedback to each other during training in operating theatres. With the availability of diverse multimedia elements, such as text, images, and spoken language, as data, employing effective feedback methods can bring substantial benefits to teachers, students, and researchers. This study synthesizes various approaches that apply multimedia to provide feedback in teaching, comparing and exploring their potential application in simulation-based medical training. The feasibility of input data, the effectiveness of feedback on recipients, and the AI method of generating or synthesizing feedback using existing data efficiency are also discussed in line with ethical standards. Finally, a multimedia feedback framework is proposed, which utilizes diverse multimedia formats and can be effectively implemented in various real-world scenarios.},

We investigated how a narrative story impacts engagement and learning, as well as how feedback can provide further benefits. To do so, we created an interactive, tablet-based learning platform with a multi-step math task designed using Common Core State Standards. Subjects completed a pretest and then were assigned to a condition, either one of three variations of the system (narratives, narratives with hints, and narratives with a tutoring chatbot using wizard-of-oz techniques) or a control system that has children complete the same learning task without narratives nor feedback, before the subjects completed a post test. 72 children in U.S. grades 3--5 participated. Our results showed that embedding learning activities into narratives boosted children's engagement as evaluated by coding video responses and surveys, and the integration of a tutoring chatbot improved learning outcomes on the assessment. These results provide evidence that a narrative-based tutoring system with chatbot-mediated help may support effective learning experiences for children.},

Despite the increasing adoption of learnersourcing in higher education, understanding students’ behaviour while engaged in learnersourcing and best practices for the design and development of learnersourcing systems are still largely under-researched. This paper offers data-driven reflections and lessons learned from the development and deployment of a learnersourcing adaptive educational system called RiPPLE, which to date, has been used in more than 50-course offerings with over 12,000 students. Our reflections are categorised into examples and best practices on (1) assessing the quality of students’ contributions using accurate, explainable and fair approaches to data analysis, (2) incentivising students to develop high-quality contributions and (3) empowering instructors with actionable and explainable insights to guide student learning. We discuss the implications of these findings and how they may contribute to the growing literature on the development of effective learnersourcing systems and more broadly technological educational solutions that support learner-centred learning at scale.},

This will assist us in using machine learning (ML) to develop a facial emotion recognition (FER) based intelligent tutor system (ITS) to support children’s metacognitive monitoring process in order to enhance their learning outcomes. In this paper, we first report the results of our preliminary research, which utilized an ML-based FER algorithm to detect four spontaneous epistemic emotions (i.e., neutral, confused, frustrated, and boredom) and six spontaneous basic emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise). Subsequently, we adapted an application (‘BrainHood’) to create the ‘Meta-BrainHood’, that embedded our proposed ML-based FER algorithm to examine the relationship between facial emotion expressions and metacognitive monitoring performance in TD children and those with ASD. Finally, we outline the future steps in our research, which adopts the outcomes of the first two steps to construct an ITS to improve children’s metacognitive monitoring performance and learning outcomes.},

abstract = {Collaboration analytics has the potential to empower teachers and students with valuable insights to facilitate more meaningful and engaging collaborative learning experiences. Towards this end, we developed computational models of student speech during small group work, identifying instances of uplifting behavior related to three Community Agreements: community building, moving thinking forward, and being respectful. Pre-trained RoBERTa language models were fine-tuned and evaluated on human annotated data (N = 9,607 student utterances from 100 unique 5-minute classroom recordings). The models achieved moderate accuracies (AUROCs between 0.67-0.84) and were robust to speech recognition errors. Preliminary generalizability studies indicated that the models generalized well to two other domains (transfer ratios between 0.46-0.85; with 1.0 indicating perfect transfer). We also developed four approaches to provide qualitative feedback in the form of noticings (i.e., specific exemplars) of positive instances of the Community Agreements, finding moderate alignment with human ratings. This research contributes to the computational modeling of the relationship dimension of collaboration from noisy classroom data, selection of positive examples for qualitative feedback, and towards the empowerment of teachers to support diverse learners during collaborative learning.},

abstract = {When used effectively, reflective writing tasks can deepen learners' understanding of key concepts, help them critically appraise their developing professional identity, and build qualities for lifelong learning. As such, reflecting writing is attracting substantial interest from universities concerned with experiential learning, reflective practice, and developing a holistic conception of the learner. However, reflective writing is for many students a novel genre to compose in, and tutors may be inexperienced in its assessment. While these conditions set a challenging context for automated solutions, natural language processing may also help address the challenge of providing real time, formative feedback on draft writing. This paper reports progress in designing a writing analytics application, detailing the methodology by which informally expressed rubrics are modelled as formal rhetorical patterns, a capability delivered by a novel web application. This has been through iterative evaluation on an independently human-annotated corpus, showing improvements from the first to second version. We conclude by discussing the reasons why classifying reflective writing has proven complex, and reflect on the design processes enabling work across disciplinary boundaries to develop the prototype to its current state.},

This study explores the use of a built-in gaming gradual intervention system (G-GIS) designed to help adult gamers achieve their desired gaming habits in an autonomous and acceptable manner. In this study, we interviewed 26 heavy adult gamers (i.e., adult gamers who played frequently and for relatively long periods of time) of an online poker game using an in-built G-GIS. Then, we triangulated the interviewees' results with their real-world behavioral data collected over eight months to explore how demographics, attitudes, and contextual factors influenced their use of the G-GIS. The results indicate that family and occupation demographics play key roles in determining adult gamers' gaming habits and their self-control under G-GIS intervention. We also revealed that adult gamers' attitudes and contextual factors can facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of the G-GIS. The findings of this study extend our understanding of heavy adult gamers and reveal how a G-GIS influences adult gamers at the individual level, which can be applied in the design of future game intervention systems, particularly for adult gamers.},

Recent work has suggested that mastery learning may provide a solution to the divergent outcomes observed in introductory computer science (CS) courses. While mastery learning has shown benefits outside of CS, it has received less attention in CS education, and there is no existing overview of the approaches that have been used in this discipline. To remedy this, we review the literature on the use of mastery learning in computer science. We find that while mastery learning has been applied successfully in CS education, the literature is sparse and lacks a unified approach and generalisable results.},

abstract = {In large introductory programming classes, teacher feedback on individual incorrect student submissions is often infeasible. Program synthesis techniques are capable of fixing student bugs and generating hints automatically, but they lack the deep domain knowledge of a teacher and can generate functionally correct but stylistically poor fixes. We introduce a mixed-initiative approach which combines teacher expertise with data-driven program synthesis techniques. We demonstrate our novel approach in two systems that use different interaction mechanisms. Our systems use program synthesis to learn bug-fixing code transformations and then cluster incorrect submissions by the transformations that correct them. The MistakeBrowser system learns transformations from examples of students fixing bugs in their own submissions. The FixPropagator system learns transformations from teachers fixing bugs in incorrect student submissions. Teachers can write feedback about a single submission or a cluster of submissions and propagate the feedback to all other submissions that can be fixed by the same transformation. Two studies suggest this approach helps teachers better understand student bugs and write reusable feedback that scales to a massive introductory programming classroom.},

Using social comparison theory [12], we investigated the influence of ability and opinion-related factors on peer feedback text in a data science MOOC. Perceived SES of peers and the formality of written responses were used as the ability-related factor, while agreement between learners represented the opinion-related factor. We focused on understanding the behaviors of those learners who are most prevalent in MOOCs; those from high socioeconomic countries. Through two studies, we found a strong and repeated influence of agreement on affect and formality in feedback to peers. While a mediation effect of perceived SES was found, a significant effect of formality was not. This work contributes to an understanding of how social comparison theory can be operationalized in online peer writing environments.},

abstract = {Interoceptive signals play a key role in genesis of our conscious experience. Modulation of interoceptive signals holds great potential for developing new human-computer interactions by creating dynamic experiences that are able to engage on user’s emotional level. We present design of a wearable system for modulating interoceptive sympathetic signal of heart rate by closed-loop feedback via pneumatic haptic stimulation on carotid baroreceptors. Our preliminary results showcase potency of the system to modulate the sympathetic activity and consequently user’s conscious experience. We discuss the potential of modulating interoceptive signals as a new paradigm towards developing interactions and affective interventions for dynamically reshaping the conscious experience.},

abstract = {The quality of most professional oral presentations is often poor, owing to a number of factors, including public speaking anxiety. We present DynamicDuo, a system that uses an automated, life-sized, animated agent to help inexperienced speakers deliver their presentations in front of an audience. The design of the system was informed by an analysis of TED talks given by two human presenters to identify the most common dual-presentation formats and transition behaviors used. In a within-subjects study (N=12) comparing co-presenting with DynamicDuo against solo-presenting with conventional presentation software, we demonstrated that our system led to significant improvements in public speaking anxiety and speaking confidence for non-native English speakers. Judges who viewed videotapes of these presentations rated those with DynamicDuo significantly higher on speech quality and overall presentation quality for all presenters.},

We analyzed a dataset of 95 triads (N=285) who used videoconferencing to collaborate on both tasks for an hour. We trained supervised natural language processing classifiers on automatic speech recognition transcripts to predict the human-coded CPS facets (skills) of constructing shared knowledge, negotiation / coordination, and maintaining team function. We tested three methods for representing collaborative discourse: (1) deep transfer learning (using BERT), (2) n-grams (counts of words/phrases), and (3) word categories (using the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count [LIWC] dictionary). We found that the BERT and LIWC methods generalized across tasks with only a small degradation in performance (Transfer Ratio of .93 with 1 indicating perfect transfer), while the n-grams had limited generalizability (Transfer Ratio of .86), suggesting overfitting to task-specific language. We discuss the implications of our findings for deploying language-based collaboration analytics in authentic educational environments.},

abstract = {Food intake is an important form of health information to observe the current status of personal health, which enables setting healthy eating goals and choosing a better diet. Based on monitoring food intake information, customized mobile interventions can help in advising users to consume a diverse and desirable quantity of healthy foods. However, previous research has not assessed whether mobile interventions enhance healthy eating behavior as an intermediary when determining whether the interventions impact health outcomes. To design mechanisms for behavior change, we need a better understanding of how mobile-based interventions affect users' motivation to change food intake behaviors and lead to healthier behavior. In this proposal, we categorize the prior interventions and behavior change techniques mainly based on three behavioral theories, i.e., control theory, theory of planned behavior, and theory of operant conditioning. Subsequently, the purpose of this thesis is: (1) to model theory-based mobile interventions for managing food intake, and (2) to investigate the impact of these mobile interventions on healthy eating behavior as an intermediary to better health outcomes. To this end, we propose three field experiment designs for future study.},

We designed, built, and deployed an experimental system called Lunch Line that promoted healthy eating. Lunch Line includes a public display that enables passersby to view the reported eating behavior of a group of people and take on daily "food challenges," and a mobile web application that allows users to record personal food choices, report challenge achievement, and compare their choices with other users and with USDA recommendations. Results from a 3-week field evaluation at a company cafeteria showed that our integrated system was effective in drawing public attention, delivering challenges, enabling self-tracking and self-reflection, and providing feedback on personal and group choices. We share lessons on how to design future systems that integrate situated public displays and personal mobile devices to encourage healthy choices.},

In this paper, we explore how to improve crowd innovation with real-time expert guidance. One approach would for experts to provide personalized feed-back, but this scales poorly, and may lead to premature convergence during creative work. Drawing on strategies for facilitating face-to-face brainstorms, we introduce a crowd ideation system where experts monitor incoming ideas through a dashboard and offer high-level “inspirations” to guide ideation. A series of controlled experiments show that experienced facilitators increased the quantity and creativity of workers' ideas compared to unfacilitated workers, while Novice facilitators reduced workers' creativity. Analyses of inspiration strategies suggest these opposing results stem from differential use of successful inspiration strategies (e.g., provoking mental simulations). The results show that expert facilitation can significantly improve crowd innovation, but inexperienced facilitators may need scaffolding to be successful.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing continues to transform our lives, including our homes and leisure activities. Smart home energy management system (SHEMS) are one example of such a technology. It connects homes to a smart grid and may increase the use of renewable energy by directing the demand to off-peak hours and reducing the overall energy demand. User values of such a technology may be critical in the acquisition, adoption and assimilation of the technology. This research fills the gap of understanding user values of SHEMS users. We studied new, potential and experienced users of SHEMS and their values. Sensory ethnography interview method was applied in the value sensitive design empirical investigation to elicit key user values of SHEMS in 28 families. The users relate to SHEMS values such as economic gains, environmental sustainability, comfort and security. Some SHEMS users' values such as stimulation, creativity, and autonomy, can be in conflict with the values of other family members, and with those which are currently built in the SHEMS technologies. The recognized values of SHEMS stakeholders act as an input for the design of smart grid and smart home services and products. In addition, the research contributes to the theory-building of smart home technology user research.},

abstract = {Activity tracking apps often make use of goals as one of their core motivational tools. There are two critical components to this tool: setting a goal, and subsequently achieving that goal. Despite its crucial role in how a number of prominent self-tracking apps function, there has been relatively little investigation of the goal-setting and achievement aspects of self-tracking apps. Here we explore this issue, investigating a particular goal setting and achievement process that is extensive, recorded, and crucial for both the app and its users' success: weight loss goals in MyFitnessPal. We present a large-scale study of 1.4 million users and weight loss goals, allowing for an unprecedented detailed view of how people set and achieve their goals. We find that, even for difficult long-term goals, behavior within the first 7 days predicts those who ultimately achieve their goals, that is, those who lose at least as much weight as they set out to, and those who do not. For instance, high amounts of early weight loss, which some researchers have classified as unsustainable, leads to higher goal achievement rates. We also show that early food intake, self-monitoring motivation, and attitude towards the goal are important factors. We then show that we can use our findings to predict goal achievement with an accuracy of 79% ROC AUC just 7 days after a goal is set. Finally, we discuss how our findings could inform steps to improve goal achievement in self-tracking apps.},

However, reducing electricity use can be difficult with only a meter and a monthly or annual electricity bill. With the emergence of new power meters units, information on electricity consumption is now available digitally and wirelessly. This enables the design and deployment of a new class of persuasive systems giving consumers insight into their use of energy resources and means for reducing it. In this paper, we explore the design and use of one such system, Power Advisor, promoting electricity conservation through tailored information on a mobile phone or tablet. The use of the system in 10 households was studied over 7 weeks. Findings provide insight into peoples awareness of electricity consumption in their home and how this may be influenced through design.},

We have implemented our technique in the Sarfgen system and evaluated it on thousands of real student attempts from the Microsoft-DEV204.1x edX course and the Microsoft CodeHunt platform. Our results show that Sarfgen can, within two seconds on average, generate concise, useful feedback for 89.7% of the incorrect student submissions.

We propose an approach to systematically understand and design for motivation, by studying the fundamental building blocks of motivation, according to the theory of planned behavior (TPB): attitude, subjective norm, and perceived control. We quantitatively analyzed (N=643) the attitudes, beliefs, and values of mobile fitness coach users with TPB. Capacity (i.e., perceived ability to exercise) had the biggest effect on users' motivation. Using individual differences theory, we identified three distinct user groups, namely followers, hedonists, and achievers. With insights from semi-structured interviews (N=5) we derive design implications finding that transformation videos that feature other users' success stories as well as suggesting an appropriate workout can have positive effects on perceived capacity. Practitioners and researchers can use our theory-based mixed-method research design to better understand user behavior in persuasive applications.},

abstract = {Inequitable software is a common problem. Bias may be caused by developers, or even software users. As a society, it is crucial that we understand and identify the causes and implications of software bias from both users and the software itself. To address the problems of inequitable software, it is essential that we inform and motivate the next generation of software developers regarding bias and its adverse impacts. However, research shows that there is a lack of easily adoptable ethics-focused educational material to support this effort.To address the problem of inequitable software, we created an easily adoptable, self-contained experiential activity that is designed to foster student interest in software ethics, with a specific emphasis on AI/ML bias. This activity involves participants selecting fictitious teammates based solely on their appearance. The participant then experiences bias either against themselves or a teammate by the activity's fictitious AI. The created lab was then utilized in this study involving 173 real-world users (age 18-51+) to better understand user bias.The primary findings of our study include: I) Participants from minority ethnic groups have stronger feeling regarding being impacted by inequitable software/AI, II) Participants with higher interest in AI/ML have a higher belief for the priority of unbiased software, III) Users do not act in an equitable manner, as avatars with 'dark' skin color are less likely to be selected, and IV) Participants from different demographic groups exhibit similar behavior bias. The created experiential lab activity may be executed using only a browser and internet connection, and is publicly available on our project website: https://all.rit.edu.Inequitable software is a significant problem in today's society. Unfortunately, there is a lack of easily adoptable experiential educational materials that educators and practitioners can use to demonstrate and understand the impacts of inequitable software. To address this challenge, we developed a hosted educational experiential activity to provide a mechanism for instructors, students, and practitioners to experience the adverse impacts of bias software firsthand. We then utilized this activity as a basis for a large in-person study involving 173 real-world users to better understand user bias.Our hosted, experiential activity demonstrates the adverse impacts of inequitable software and bias. This is accomplished by inflicting bias against the participant and fictitious teammates in a simple tic-tac-toe game. The activity may be adopted using only a web browser and internet connection. The activity is available on the project website: https://all.rit.edu.To better understand user bias, the created experiential activity was utilized in a large in-person study. The primary findings of this study are that: participants from minority ethnicity demographics have stronger feeling towards inequitable software/AI; participants with higher interest in machine learning and AI have higher beliefs in the prioritization of unbiased software, and that users do not act in an equitable manner - choosing teammates of color at a disproportionately low rate.This work benefits educators by providing an easily adoptable experiential educational activity that they may use to demonstrate the adverse impacts of inequitable software in the classroom. The activity may also be used to foster discussions pertaining to this foundational and essential topic. Researchers will benefit from this work through an increased understanding of inequitable decisions made by users.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring, or energy disaggregation, aims to separate household energy consumption data collected from a single point of measurement into appliance-level consumption data. In recent years, the field has rapidly expanded due to increased interest as national deployments of smart meters have begun in many countries. However, empirically comparing disaggregation algorithms is currently virtually impossible. This is due to the different data sets used, the lack of reference implementations of these algorithms and the variety of accuracy metrics employed. To address this challenge, we present the Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK); an open source toolkit designed specifically to enable the comparison of energy disaggregation algorithms in a reproducible manner. This work is the first research to compare multiple disaggregation approaches across multiple publicly available data sets. Our toolkit includes parsers for a range of existing data sets, a collection of preprocessing algorithms, a set of statistics for describing data sets, two reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms and a suite of accuracy metrics. We demonstrate the range of reproducible analyses which are made possible by our toolkit, including the analysis of six publicly available data sets and the evaluation of both benchmark disaggregation algorithms across such data sets.},

TEGCER uses supervised classification to match compilation errors in new code submissions with relevant pre-existing errors, submitted by other students before. The dense neural network used to perform this classification task is trained on 15000+ error-repair code examples. The proposed model yields a test set classification Pred@3 accuracy of 97.7% across 212 error category labels. Using this model as its base, TEGCER presents students with the closest relevant examples of solutions for their specific error on demand. A large scale (N &gt; 230) usability study shows that students who use TEGCER are able to resolve errors more than 25% faster on average than students being assisted by human tutors.},

abstract = {Data collection on the population is a key mode of public health management in the Global South. This information is seen as a means to improve health metrics through welfare programs. In this study, we examine the changes brought about by an ICT-based Real-Time Monitoring System to the infrastructure of a welfare program and the nature of work of Anganwadi workers in India. Anganwadi workers, traditionally serving as daycare providers and community health workers, are increasingly being asked to serve primarily as data collectors for the new digital system. We ask the question 'cui bono?' to this system by drawing attention to the precarity of Anganwadi workers whose care-work is standardized through this app for 'efficient' monitoring by the Indian state but remains contingent on their relationship with the local community and ability to mobilize resources on the ground. Using auto-ethnographic and interview methods, we find that Anganwadi workers are caught between conflicting demands of state bureaucracy and the situated nature of their care work resulting in forms of ambivalent care. We find that the real-time monitoring apps intended to collect data for efficient delivery of state services end up serving the state's need for performing care through data rhetorics produced at the expense of the professional and personal well-being of the workers, and arguably the communities they serve.},

abstract = {More and more people take up learning how to program: in schools and universities, in large open online courses or by learning it by themselves. A large number of tools have been developed over the years to support learners with the difficult task of building programs. Many of these tools focus on the resulting program and not on the process: they fail to help the student to take the necessary steps towards the final program.We have developed a prototype of a programming tutor to help students with feedback and hints to progress towards a solution for an introductory imperative programming problem. We draw upon the ideas of a similar tutor for functional programming and translate these ideas to a different paradigm. Our tutor is based on model solutions from which a programming strategy is derived, capturing the different paths to these solutions. We allow for variation by expanding the strategy with alternatives and using program transformations. The instructor is able to adapt the behaviour of the tutor by annotating the model solutions.We show a tutoring session to demonstrate that a student can arrive at a solution by following the generated hints. We have found that we can recognise between 33% and 75% of student solutions to three programming exercises that are similar to a model solution, which we can increase by incorporating more variations.},

Similar to asynchronous online learning environments, PJBL students typically work in self-directed teams at times and places of their choice. Thus, it is difficult for the educators to identify technical and emotional challenges that students experience—especially with large cohorts. To bridge the disconnect between educators and students in such learning situations and to be able to provide students with timely feedback and support, we have experimented with the use of an emotion detection tool to automatically recognise students’ emotional states and the issues that they might face. Our results show that the detected emotions moderately to strongly correlate with students’ issues as observed by the academic coordinators and also with students’ final marks. However, our explorations also highlighted ethical challenges when using emotion-aware learning analytics. This paper describes our experiences and discusses possible ways to address those challenges.},

In this work, we design and evaluate Let’s FOCUS, a software-based intervention service that assists college students in self-regulating their mobile phone use in classrooms. Our preliminary survey study (with 47 professors and 283 students) reveals that it is critical to encourage voluntary participation by framing intervention as a learning tool and to raise awareness regarding appropriate mobile phone usage by establishing social norms in colleges. Let’s FOCUS introduces a virtual limiting space for each class (or a virtual classroom) where the students can explicitly restrict their mobile phone use voluntarily. Furthermore, it promotes students’ willing participation by leveraging social facilitation and context-aware reminders associated with virtual classrooms. We conducted a campus-wide campaign for approximately six weeks to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results confirm that 379 students used the app to limit 9,335 hours of mobile phone usage over 233 classrooms. Let’s FOCUS was used in diverse learning contexts and for different purposes and its social learning and context-awareness features significantly motivated prolonged participation. We present the design considerations of software-based intervention.},

While existing work in scaling open-ended courses primarily focuses on the evaluation and feedback of open-ended assignments, there is a lack of understanding of how to effectively teach open-ended, university-level courses at scale. To better understand the needs of teaching large-scale, open-ended courses online effectively in a university setting, we conducted a mixed-methods study with university instructors and students, using surveys and interviews, and identified five critical pedagogical elements that distinguish the teaching and learning experiences in an open-ended course from that in a non-open-ended course. An overarching theme for the five elements was the need to support students' self-expression. We further uncovered open challenges and opportunities when incorporating the five critical pedagogical elements into large-scale, open-ended courses online in a university setting, and suggested six future research directions: (1) facilitate in-depth conversations, (2) create a studio-friendly environment, (3) adapt to open-ended assessment, (4) scale individual open-ended feedback, (5) establish trust for self-expression, and (6) personalize instruction and harness the benefits of student diversity.},

abstract = {Public transportation systems are among the most ubiquitous and complex large-scale systems found in modern society. For those unable to drive such as people with cognitive disabilities, these systems are essential gateways for participation in community activities, socialization, and independence. To understand the magnitude and scope of this national problem, we highlight deficiencies identified in an international study by the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council and present specific cognitive barriers identified in empirical studies of transportation systems in several U.S. cities.An interdisciplinary team of HCI researchers, urban transportation planners, commercial technologists, and assistive care specialists are now collaborating on the Mobility-for-All project to create architectures and prototypes that support those with cognitive disabilities and their caregivers. We have grounded our research and design efforts using a distributed cognition framework. We have derived requirements for our designs by analyzing “how things are” for individuals with cognitive disabilities who learn and use public transportation systems. We present a socio-technical architecture that has three components: a) a personal travel assistant that uses real-time Global Positioning Systems data from the bus fleet to deliver just-in-time prompts; b) a mobile prompting client and a prompting script configuration tool for caregivers; and c) a monitoring system that collects real-time task status from the mobile client and alerts the support community of potential problems. We then describe a phased community-centered assessment approach that begins at the design stage and continues to be integrated throughout the project.This research has broad implications for designing more human-centered transportation systems that are universally accessible for other disenfranchised communities such as the elderly or nonnative speaker. This project presents an “in-the-world” research opportunity that challenges our understanding about mobile human computer interactions with ubiquitous, context-aware computing architectures in noisy, uncontrolled environments; personalization and user modeling techniques; and the design of universally accessible interfaces for complex systems through participatory design processes.This article provides both a near-term vision and an architecture for transportation systems that are socially inclusive, technologically appealing, and easier for everyone to use.},

abstract = {Despite a lack of consensus on the nature of Computing Research Methods (CRM), a growing number of programs are exploring models and content for CRM courses. This report is one step in a participatory design process to develop a general framework for thinking about and teaching CRM.We introduce a novel sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That structure consists of a road map to the CRM literature, a framework grounded in questions rather than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills and specific skills. We integrate our structure with a model for the process a learner goes through on the way to becoming an expert computing researcher and offer example learning activities that represent a growing repository of course materials meant to aid those wishing to teach research skills to computing students.Our model is designed to ground discussion of teaching CRM and to serve as a roadmap for institutions, faculty, students and research communities addressing the transition from student to fully enfranchised member of a computing research community of practice. To that end, we offer several possible scenarios for using our model.In computing, research methods have traditionally been passed from advisor to student via apprenticeship. Establishing a richer pedagogy for training researchers in computing will benefit all (see Figure 1).},

abstract = {We develop a new model and algorithms for machine learning-based learning analytics, which estimate a learner's knowledge of the concepts underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimate the relationships among a collection of questions and those concepts. Our model represents the probability that a learner provides the correct response to a question in terms of three factors: their understanding of a set of underlying concepts, the concepts involved in each question, and each question's intrinsic difficulty. We estimate these factors given the graded responses to a collection of questions. The underlying estimation problem is ill-posed in general, especially when only a subset of the questions are answered. The key observation that enables a well-posed solution is the fact that typical educational domains of interest involve only a small number of key concepts. Leveraging this observation, we develop both a bi-convex maximum-likelihood-based solution and a Bayesian solution to the resulting SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) problem. We also incorporate user-defined tags on questions to facilitate the interpretability of the estimated factors. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we make a connection between SPARFA and noisy, binary-valued (1-bit) dictionary learning that is of independent interest.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore using Parsons problems to scaffold novice programmers who are struggling while solving write-code problems. Parsons problems, in which students put mixed-up code blocks in order, can be created quickly and already serve thousands of students while other types of programming support methods are expensive to develop or do not scale. We conducted two studies in which novices were given equivalent Parsons problems as optional scaffolding while solving write-code problems. We investigated when, why, and how students used the Parsons problems as well as their perceptions of the benefits and challenges. A think-aloud observational study with 11 undergraduate students showed that students utilized the Parsons problem before writing a solution to get ideas about where to start; during writing a solution when they were stuck; and after writing a solution to debug errors and look for better strategies. Semi-structured interviews with the same 11 undergraduate students provided evidence that using Parsons problems to scaffold write-code problems helped students to reduce the difficulty, reduce the problem completion time, learn problem-solving strategies, and refine their programming knowledge. However, some students found them less useful if the Parsons solution did not match their approach or if they did not understand the solution. We then conducted a between-subjects classroom study with 81 undergraduate students to investigate the effects on learning. We found that students who received Parsons problems as scaffolding during write-code problems spent significantly less time solving those problems. However, there was no significant learning gain in either condition from pretest to posttest. We also discuss the design implications of our findings.},

abstract = {A semi-automated manufacturing system that entails human intervention in the middle of the process is a representative collaborative system that requires active interaction between humans and machines. User behavior induced by the operator’s decision-making process greatly impacts system operation and performance in such an environment that requires human-machine collaboration. There has been room for utilizing machine-generated data for a fine-grained understanding of the relationship between the behavior and performance of operators in the industrial domain, while multiple streams of data have been collected from manufacturing machines. In this study, we propose a large-scale data-analysis methodology that comprises data contextualization and performance modeling to understand the relationship between operator behavior and performance. For a case study, we collected machine-generated data over 6-months periods from a highly automated machine in a large tire manufacturing facility. We devised a set of metrics consisting of six human-machine interaction factors and four work environment factors as independent variables, and three performance factors as dependent variables. Our modeling results reveal that the performance variations can be explained by the interaction and work environment factors (R2 = 0.502, 0.356, and 0.500 for the three performance factors, respectively). Finally, we discuss future research directions for the realization of context-aware computing in semi-automated systems by leveraging machine-generated data as a new modality in human-machine collaboration.},

We conducted an explorative study (N = 19) of the browser extension Aiki, which redirects a user from a self-defined ‘time-wasting’ website to an online platform for learning programming (Sololearn, Codecademy, or Udemy). Based on quantitative measures alone, using Aiki decreased the participants’ time spent on time-wasting websites on average, and increased programming knowledge. However, several users ended up avoiding their time-wasting websites entirely when Aiki was active, or they discontinued the use of the extension after ‘the novelty wore off’. Based on these effects, we qualitatively explored the user experiences and identified four challenges and four opportunities for using redirection of activity as an intervention strategy for self-regulation of time management in a browser. Our results suggest that this intervention strategy is promising, but careful design is necessary to strike an optimal balance between independence and regulation.},

abstract = {A sophisticated grasp of self-regulated learning (SRL) skills has become essential for learners in computer-based learning environment (CBLE). One aspect of SRL is the plan-making process, which, although emphasized in many SRL theoretical frameworks, has attracted little research attention. Few studies have investigated the extent to which learners complied with their planned strategies, and whether making a strategic plan is associated with actual strategy use. Limited studies have examined the role of prior knowledge in predicting planned and actual strategy use. In this study, we developed a CBLE to collect trace data, which were analyzed to investigate learners’ plan-making process and its association with planned and actual strategy use. Analysis of prior knowledge and trace data of 202 participants indicated that 1) learners tended to adopt strategies that significantly deviated from their planned strategies, 2) the level of prior knowledge was associated with planned strategies, and 3) neither the act of plan-making nor prior knowledge predicted actual strategy use. These insights bear implications for educators and educational technologists to recognise the dynamic nature of strategy adoption and to devise approaches that inspire students to continually revise and adjust their plans, thereby strengthening SRL.},

abstract = {The increased popularity of recreational sports, like running, led to the development of numerous technologies supporting people in their training. However, in their current form and interaction, these take a rather standardized approach focusing on quantified data tracking displayed through screens or audio. In this paper, we explore how dynamic data physicalization through a shape-changing interface can open the design space of exercise feedback. Relying on an expert study on the aesthetics of interaction (N=23), we designed Laina, a shape-changing art piece presenting physicalized running data through a slow feedback mechanism. We deployed Laina at 3 participant's home, during a series of 3-weeks field studies. Results show that Laina allows for deep reflection, anticipation and exploration of running behavior. The aim of our paper is to provide insights on the use of slow feedback mechanisms for exercise-related products, through the design of a dynamic data physicalization artefact.},

abstract = {We present and discuss a fully-automated collaboration system, CoCo, that allows multiple participants to video chat and receive feedback through custom video conferencing software. After a conferencing session, a virtual feedback assistant provides insights on the conversation to participants. CoCo automatically pulls audial and visual data during conversations and analyzes the extracted streams for affective features, including smiles, engagement, attention, as well as speech overlap and turn-taking. We validated CoCo with 39 participants split into 10 groups. Participants played two back-to-back team-building games, Lost at Sea and Survival on the Moon, with the system providing feedback between the two. With feedback, we found a statistically significant change in balanced participation---that is, everyone spoke for an equal amount of time. There was also statistically significant improvement in participants' self-evaluations of conversational skills awareness, including how often they let others speak, as well as of teammates' conversational skills.

abstract = {There is increasing agreement that teaching students ethics in computer science (CS) is important, but there is little agreement about how to teach ethics, when to teach ethics, or even what ethics curricula should include. CS programs are experimenting with both stand-alone courses and approaches that integrate ethics throughout the computer science curriculum. Drawing from work in CS education and Science &amp; Technology Studies, we designed an integrated and interdisciplinary ethics intervention to help computer security students identify where ethics and politics intersect with their technical field and encourage students to see themselves as practitioners of politics and ethics. Through analysis of student assignments, post-course surveys, and instructor reflections, we found that, while our intervention had benefits for students and instructors, it only weakly encouraged students to think of themselves as practitioners of ethics and politics. Students also struggled to confidently adjudicate ethical dilemmas given only a set of ethical principles. Finally, the ethical principles we gave students strongly shaped their analysis -- for example, students were more likely to consider disparate impacts of technology on marginalized groups when directly prompted to do so. Our results suggest that integrated and inter-disciplinary approaches have many benefits, but they require additional resources beyond a single course to effectively support students in adjudicating ethical dilemmas.},

abstract = {Mental health conditions have become a global public health issue, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To cope with the increasing demand for mental health services, many people have turned to smartphone applications that offer various mental health solutions, such as therapy, counseling, and self-help. However, these applications also pose significant privacy risks for their users, as they collect and share sensitive personal and health information with third parties, often without adequate consent or transparency. In this study, we examine the privacy policies of popular mental health smartphone applications using the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), a widely recognized privacy framework. Our objective is to assess the extent to which these applications adhere to the FIPPs guidelines and to identify the gaps and challenges in their privacy practices. We hope that our findings can inform and guide policy makers and application developers to design more user-centric and robust privacy policies that ensure the safety and security of users’ information.},

The H2020 funded project FACTS4WORKERS - Worker-Centric Workplaces in Smart Factories - aims to develop user-centered assistance systems in order to demonstrate their impact and applicability at the shop floor. To do so it is important to understand how to develop such tools and how to assess if advantages can be derived from the created ICT system. This study introduces the technology of a workplace solution that is linked to a specific industrial challenge. Subsequently, a 2-stepped approach to evaluate the presented system is discussed. Heuristics, which are an output of project "Heuristics for Industry 4.0" are used to test if the developed solution covers critical aspects of socio-technical system design. Insights into the design, development and holistic evaluation of digital tools at the shop floor should be shown.},

We then uncover design considerations for these systems, drawing from data from three years of ethnographic fieldwork with women frontline health workers and women from marginalized communities in Delhi (India). Finally, we outline an agenda for AI systems that target Social Good, drawing from literature on HCI4D, post-development critique, and transnational feminist theory. Our paper thus offers a critical and ethnographic perspective to inform the design of AI systems that target social impact.},

abstract = {The effective delivery of e-learning depends on the continuous monitoring and management of student attention. While instructors in traditional classroom settings can easily assess crowd attention through gaze cues, these cues are largely unavailable in online learning environments. To address this challenge and highlight the significance of our study, we collected eye movement data from twenty students and developed four visualization methods: (a) a heat map, (b) an ellipse map, (c) two moving bars, and (d) a vertical bar, which were overlaid on 13 instructional videos. Our results revealed unexpected preferences among the instructors. Contrary to expectations, they did not prefer the established heat map and vertical bar for live online instruction. Instead, they chose the less intrusive ellipse visualization. Nevertheless, the heat map remained the preferred choice for retrospective analysis due to its more detailed information. Importantly, all visualizations were found to be useful and to help restore emotional connections in online learning. In conclusion, our innovative visualizations of crowd attention show considerable potential for a wide range of applications, extending beyond e-learning to all online presentations and retrospective analyses. The significant results of our study underscore the critical role these visualizations will play in enhancing both the effectiveness and emotional connectedness of future e-learning experiences, thereby facilitating the educational landscape.},

This study seeks to gain a more precise understanding of why and how MSM are using social networking mobile apps, and informs the theoretical debate concerning the impact of social networking technology on sexual risk behaviors. A questionnaire survey was conducted, both online and offline, with young MSM app-users in Hong Kong to examine their apps use (frequency, history, and exposure of own face and body) and recent sexual partnering via apps (total sexual partners [TSP] and condomless sex partners [CSP]) in relation to gratifications sought and sexual sensation seeking. The results indicated that finding sexual partners was not a high priority for using MSM apps; surveillance, relationship, and diversion motives were more important while social motive shared similar importance. App-use frequency, sex motive, and sexual sensation seeking predicted more TSP while surveillance motive predicted fewer TSP. None of these variables, however, directly predicted CSP. Sexual sensation seeking in interaction with sex or diversion motive predicted both TSP and CSP. Despite lacking significant association with sex motive or sexual sensation seeking, app-use frequency was a stronger independent predictor of TSP. While frequent app use may facilitate more app-met sexual partners, this study found no evidence indicating that app use promotes riskier sexual behavior with those partners.},

abstract = {Home health aides (HHAs) increasingly being used by adults with heart failure for long-term assistance and post-hospitalization care. Despite being heavily involved in numerous aspects of heart failure management, most HHAs have not received heart failure training. They also struggle to get in touch with supervising nurses or other members of the care team when they have clinical questions, which may result in unnecessary visits to the emergency room. In addition, despite serving as a backbone in the health system for patients, HHAs, who are mostly women and minorities, are a marginalized and vulnerable group of frontline caregivers, enduring erratic employment, low wages, discrimination, and high levels of burnout. Although digital technologies could help to address many of the challenges HHAs face, little is known about the current impact of technology on HHAs work practices. To this end, we conducted a multi-stakeholder qualitative study with 38 participants in New York City using semi-structured interviews and focus groups. We uncover the ways in which technology is used, the complex socio-technical factors that underpin heart failure care, and stakeholder suggestions for how technology could improve HHAs work. Building on these insights, we synthesize design opportunities for researchers and designers interested in developing tools that support the delivery of home health care for patients suffering from life-threatening diseases like heart failure.},

In this paper we investigate the effect and possibilities of live remote cheering on co-located athletes and online supporting crowds that have a weak social tie and no social tie with the athlete. We recruit 140 online spectators and 5 athletes for an ad-hoc 5km road race. Results indicate that crowds socially closer to the athletes are significantly more engaged in the support. The athletes were excited by live remote cheering from friendsourced spectators and cheering from unknown crowdsourced participants indicating that remote friends and outsourced spectators could be an important source of support.},

abstract = {Automatic emotion recognition (ER)-enabled wellbeing interventions use ER algorithms to infer the emotions of a data subject (i.e., a person about whom data is collected or processed to enable ER) based on data generated from their online interactions, such as social media activity, and intervene accordingly. The potential commercial applications of this technology are widely acknowledged, particularly in the context of social media. Yet, little is known about data subjects' conceptualizations of and attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. To address this gap, we interviewed 13 US adult social media data subjects regarding social media-based automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. We found that participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions were predominantly negative. Negative attitudes were largely shaped by how participants compared their conceptualizations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the humans that traditionally deliver wellbeing support. Comparisons between AI and human wellbeing interventions were based upon human attributes participants doubted AI could hold: 1) helpfulness and authentic care; 2) personal and professional expertise; 3) morality; and 4) benevolence through shared humanity. In some cases, participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions shifted when participants conceptualized automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions' impact on others, rather than themselves. Though with reluctance, a minority of participants held more positive attitudes toward their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, citing their potential to benefit others: 1) by supporting academic research; 2) by increasing access to wellbeing support; and 3) through egregious harm prevention. However, most participants anticipated harms associated with their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions for others, such as re-traumatization, the spread of inaccurate health information, inappropriate surveillance, and interventions informed by inaccurate predictions. Lastly, while participants had qualms about automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, we identified three development and delivery qualities of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions upon which their attitudes toward them depended: 1) accuracy; 2) contextual sensitivity; and 3) positive outcome. Our study is not motivated to make normative statements about whether or how automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions should exist, but to center voices of the data subjects affected by this technology. We argue for the inclusion of data subjects in the development of requirements for ethical and trustworthy ER applications. To that end, we discuss ethical, social, and policy implications of our findings, suggesting that automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions imagined by participants are incompatible with aims to promote trustworthy, socially aware, and responsible AI technologies in the current practical and regulatory landscape in the US.},

abstract = {In recent years, with growing health consciousness, at-home workout has become increasingly popular for its convenience and safety. Most people choose to follow video guidance during exercising. However, our preliminary study revealed that fitness-minded people face challenges when watching exercise videos on handheld devices or fixed monitors, such as limited movement comprehension due to static camera angles and insufficient feedback. To address these issues, we reviewed popular workout videos, identified user requirements, and came up with an augmented reality (AR) solution. Following a user-centered iterative design process, we proposed a design space of AR visual cues for workouts and implemented an AR-based application. Specifically, we captured users’ exercise performance with pose-tracking technology and provided feedback via AR visual cues. Two user experiments showed that incorporating AR visual cues could improve movement comprehension and enable users to adjust their movements based on real-time feedback. Finally, we presented several suggestions to inspire future design and apply AR visual cues to sports training.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

abstract = {Data annotation interfaces predominantly leverage ground truth labels to guide annotators toward accurate responses. With the growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in domain-specific professional tasks, it has become increasingly important to help beginning annotators identify how their early-stage knowledge can lead to inaccurate answers, which in turn, helps to ensure quality annotations at scale. To investigate this issue, we conducted a formative study involving eight individuals from the field of disaster management, each possessing varying levels of expertise. The goal was to understand the prevalent factors contributing to disagreements among annotators when classifying Twitter messages related to disasters and to analyze their respective responses. Our analysis identified two primary causes of disagreement between expert and beginner annotators: 1) a lack of contextual knowledge or uncertainty about the situation, and 2) the absence of visual or supplementary cues. Based on these findings, we designed a Context interface, which generates aids that help beginners identify potential mistakes and provide the hidden context of the presented tweet. The summative study compares Context design with two widely used designs in data annotation UI, Highlight and Reasoning-based interfaces. We found significant differences between these designs in terms of attitudinal and behavioral data. We conclude with implications for designing future interfaces aiming at closing the knowledge gap among annotators.},

abstract = {Previous work demonstrated that esports players often leverage insights from other players and communities to learn and improve. However, little research examined social learning in esports, over time, in granular detail. Understanding the role of others in the esports learning process has implications for the design of computational support systems that can help esports players learn and make the games more accessible. Therefore, we perform an exploration of this topic using Co-Regulated Learning as a theoretical lens. In doing so, we hope to enrich existing knowledge on social learning in esports, provide insights for the future development of computational support, and a road-map for future work. Through an interview study of an esports community consisting of 14, college-aged, male players, we uncovered 10 themes regarding how Co-Regulated learning occurs within their teams. Based on these, we discuss three main takeaways and their implications for future research and development.},

abstract = {Patient-provider communication influences patient health outcomes, and analyzing such communication could help providers identify opportunities for improvement, leading to better care. Interpersonal communication can be assessed through “social-signals” expressed in non-verbal, vocal behaviors like interruptions, turn-taking, and pitch. To automate this assessment, we introduce a machine-learning pipeline that ingests audio-streams of conversations and tracks the magnitude of four social-signals: dominance, interactivity, engagement, and warmth. This pipeline is embedded into ConverSense, a web-application for providers to visualize their communication patterns, both within and across visits. Our user study with 5 clinicians and 10 patient visits demonstrates ConverSense’s potential to provide feedback on communication challenges, as well as the need for this feedback to be contextualized within the specific underlying visit and patient interaction. Through this novel approach that uses data-driven self-reflection, ConverSense can help providers improve their communication with patients to deliver improved quality of care.},

Findings reveal the need to recognize and define an individual right to what we introduce as emotional privacy, as well as raise important research and policy questions on how to protect and preserve emotional privacy within and beyond the workplace.},

abstract = {We have built and implemented a set of metaphors for breathing games by involving children and experts. These games are made to facilitate prevention of asthma exacerbation via regular monitoring of children with asthma through spirometry at home. To instruct and trigger children to execute the (unsupervised) spirometry correctly, we have created interactive metaphors that respond in real-time to the child's inhalation and exhalation. Eleven metaphors have been developed in detail. Three metaphors have been fully implemented based on current guidelines for spirometry and were tested with 30 asthmatic children. Each includes multi-target incentives, responding to three different target values (inhalation, peak expiration, and complete exhalation). We postulate that the metaphors should use separate goals for these targets, have independent responses, and allow to also go beyond expected values for each of these targets. From the selected metaphors, most children preferred a dragon breathing fire and a soccer player kicking a ball into a goal as a metaphor; least liked were blowing seeds of a dandelion and applying lotion to a dog to grow its hair. Based on this project we discuss the potential and benefits of a suite-of-games approach: multiple games that each can be selected and adapted depending on personal capabilities and interests.},

Using this information, the system automatically derives minimal corrections to student's incorrect solutions, providing them with a measure of exactly how incorrect a given solution was, as well as feedback about what they did wrong.We introduce a simple language for describing error models in terms of correction rules, and formally define a rule-directed translation strategy that reduces the problem of finding minimal corrections in an incorrect program to the problem of synthesizing a correct program from a sketch. We have evaluated our system on thousands of real student attempts obtained from the Introduction to Programming course at MIT (6.00) and MITx (6.00x). Our results show that relatively simple error models can correct on average 64% of all incorrect submissions in our benchmark set.},

In consultation with domain professionals and families, we designed WAKEY, a technology-based approach that helps parents use better communication strategies to teach preschool children to carry out their morning routines. Following the intervention with WAKEY, parents reported significantly reduced levels of frustration during morning routines and greater independent behavior by children. Furthermore, parents reported experiencing changes in their parenting attitudes and finding new insights into communication.},

abstract = {Autograding systems are being increasingly deployed to meet the challenges of teaching programming at scale. Studies show that formative feedback can greatly help novices learn programming. This work extends an autograder, enabling it to provide formative feedback on programming assignment submissions. Our methodology starts with the design of a knowledge map, which is the set of concepts and skills that are necessary to complete an assignment, followed by the design of the assignment and that of a comprehensive test suite for identifying logical errors in the submitted code. Test cases are used to test the student submissions and learn classes of common errors. For each assignment, we train a classifier that automatically categorizes errors in a submission based on the outcome of the test suite. The instructor maps the errors to corresponding concepts and skills and writes hints to help students find their misconceptions and mistakes. We apply this methodology to two assignments in our Introduction to Computer Science course and find that the automatic error categorization has a 90% average accuracy. We report and compare data from two semesters, one semester when hints are given for the two assignments and one when hints are not given. Results show that the percentage of students who successfully complete the assignments after an initial erroneous submission is three times greater when hints are given compared to when hints are not given. However, on average, even when hints are provided, almost half of the students fail to correct their code so that it passes all the test cases. The initial implementation of the framework focuses on the functional correctness of the programs as reflected by the outcome of the test cases. In our future work, we will explore other kinds of feedback and approaches to automatically generate feedback to better serve the educational needs of the students.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed in various downstream tasks, e.g., auto-completion, aided writing, or chat-based text generation. However, the considered output candidates of the underlying search algorithm are under-explored and under-explained. We tackle this shortcoming by proposing a tree-in-the-loop approach, where a visual representation of the beam search tree is the central component for analyzing, explaining, and adapting the generated outputs. To support these tasks, we present generAItor, a visual analytics technique, augmenting the central beam search tree with various task-specific widgets, providing targeted visualizations and interaction possibilities. Our approach allows interactions on multiple levels and offers an iterative pipeline that encompasses generating, exploring, and comparing output candidates, as well as fine-tuning the model based on adapted data. Our case study shows that our tool generates new insights in gender bias analysis beyond state-of-the-art template-based methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a qualitative user study. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate the adaptability of the model to few samples, as occurring in text-generation use cases.},

abstract = {Meditation is a mind-body practice with considerable wellbeing benefits that can take different forms. Novices usually start with focused attention meditation that supports regulation of attention towards an inward focus or internal bodily sensations and away from external stimuli or distractors. Most meditation technologies employ metaphorical mappings of meditative states to visual or soundscape representations to support awareness of mind wandering and attention regulation, although the rationale for such mappings is seldom articulated. Moreover, such external modalities also take the focus attention away from the body. We advance the concept of interoceptive interaction and employed the embodied metaphor theory to explore the design of mappings to the interoceptive sense of thermoception. We illustrate this concept with WarmMind, an on-body interface integrating heat actuators for mapping meditation states. We report on an exploratory study with 10 participants comparing our novel thermal metaphors for mapping meditation states with comparable ones, albeit in aural modality, as provided by Muse meditation app. Findings indicate a tension between the highly discoverable soundscape's metaphors which however hinder attention regulation, and the ambiguous thermal metaphors experienced as coming from the body and supported attention regulation. We discuss the qualities of embodied metaphors underpinning this tension and propose an initial framework to inform the design of metaphorical mappings for meditation technologies.},

abstract = {Software traceability provides support for various engineering activities including Program Comprehension; however, it can be challenging and arduous to complete in large industrial projects. Researchers have proposed automated traceability techniques to create, maintain and leverage trace links. Computationally intensive techniques, such as repository mining and deep learning, have showed the capability to deliver accurate trace links. The objective of achieving trusted, automated tracing techniques at industrial scale has not yet been successfully accomplished due to practical performance challenges. This paper evaluates high-performance solutions for deploying effective, computationally expensive trace-ability algorithms in large scale industrial projects and leverages generated trace links to answer Program Comprehension Queries. We comparatively evaluate four different platforms for supporting industrial-scale tracing solutions, capable of tackling software projects with millions of artifacts. We demonstrate that tracing solutions built using big data frameworks scale well for large projects and that our Spark implementation outperforms relational database, graph database (GraphDB), and plain Java implementations. These findings contradict earlier results which suggested that GraphDB solutions should be adopted for large-scale tracing problems.},

While HCI research has investigated people’s financial literacy and decision-making and how to design for it, little is known as to how people form financial conversations on social media. To answer this question, we used a grounded theory approach to analyzing financial conversations in the YOLO (‘you only live once’) posts on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (WSB), one of today’s largest financial online communities. We describe how WSB’s discursive culture portrays its gambling-like, high-risk trading by likening trading to gambling, celebrating it, and normalizing financial risk-taking. We discuss the rise of social investing, including how individual investors’ affective relationships encourage their outsized risk-taking, as well as reflect on its looming financial risks, especially to already marginalized groups. Lastly, we propose implications for design and policymaking.},

However, current AR tutorial authoring processes are not seamless as they require users to continuously alternate between operating instruments and interacting with virtual elements. We present InstruMentAR, a system that automatically generates AR tutorials through recording user demonstrations. We design a multimodal approach that fuses gestural information and hand-worn pressure sensor data to detect and register the user’s step-by-step manipulations on the control panel. With this information, the system autonomously generates virtual cues with designated scales to respective locations for each step. Voice recognition and background capture are employed to automate the creation of text and images as AR content. For novice users receiving the authored AR tutorials, we facilitate immediate feedback through haptic modules. We compared InstruMentAR with traditional systems in the user study.},

abstract = {Despite the availability of various methods and tools to facilitate secure coding, developers continue to write code that contains common vulnerabilities. It is important to understand why technological advances do not sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure code. To widen our understanding of developers' behaviour, we considered the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory from cognitive and social psychology. Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps. Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors. Interventions will be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication, psychological frameworks, and usability. Our analysis suggests “adaptive security interventions” as a solution that responds to the changing security needs of individual developers and a present a proof-of-concept tool to substantiate our suggestion.},

Fewer still focus on the challenges of eliciting discussion and generating design ideas around subjective experiences involving emotions, feelings, and thoughts. We argue these are of growing need in a post-Covid world. In this paper we contribute a methodological design rationale for a remotely facilitated co-design study aimed at addressing challenges related to ethically eliciting reflection on, promoting ideation around and capturing data of children and families about their personal Covid-19 experiences. To illustrate our methods, we provide exemplar cases of data collected from our participants to show the type of data that can be elicited using our methods. Lastly, we contribute considerations for future methods design based on a selection of our lessons learned.},

The project aims to build the capacity of middle school teachers in teaching its computer science and digital literacy (CSDL) curriculum and eventually engaging culturally diverse students in creating apps for community and social good.Through the lens of conceptual change, the study will explore how teachers build their concept of CRP throughout the project by using both qualitative and quantitative data. We are seeking the answers to two research questions: 1) What are teachers' understandings of CRP before and after attending the project's PL and teaching computer science? 2) How do teachers develop their concepts of CRP for teaching CS? Findings of this study will provide a deeper understanding of different CRP conceptual development pathways that teachers experience. Findings of this study can provide insights for the design of PL programs to help teachers update and reorganize their understandings and eventually improve their CRP classroom practices in teaching CS.},

This presents an important but under-researched opportunity to improve youth well-being through interaction design. We developed Locus, a mobile application that shapes adolescents’ entry experiences into the social media apps on their phones by prompting them to reflect on their social media intentions before they open an app and at the end of the day. In designing Locus, we combined psychology theories—to identify design targets—with co-design approaches—to design around these targets for youth's lived experiences. Following co-design work with nine teens (Mage=15.7 years), we conducted an open trial field deployment (N = 54; Mage=16.2 years) to explore how Locus was used and experienced by adolescents during their daily lives. Results provide preliminary evidence that in-the-moment interventions for self-regulation skills can support adolescents’ intentional social media use.},

Although there is scope for use of technological tools, referred here as “intelligent tutoring systems”, to scaffold this process, it is currently unclear whether existing intelligent systems that generate human-language like questions is beneficial. Additionally, training data used in the development of these automated question generation systems is typically sourced without attention to demographics, but people with different cultural backgrounds may ask different questions. As a part of a broader project to design an intelligent reading support app for Latinx children, we crowd–sourced questions from Latinx caregivers and non-caregivers as well as caregivers and non-caregivers from other demographics. We examine variations in question-asking within this dataset mediated by individual, cultural, and contextual factors. We then design a system that automatically extracts templates from this data to generate open-ended questions that are representative of those asked by Latinx caregivers.},

Such advice might be assumed to imply that nomadic tangible systems that employ improvised tokens are liable to have highly impaired usability. In this paper we describe a proof of concept experiment for Kolab, a nomadic tangible interaction system that permits any surface to be appropriated as a collaborative tabletop, and which affords the use of a wide range of appropriated artifacts as improvised tangibles. We demonstrate an approach for realizing the necessary interaction techniques combining tangibles and hand gestures using a fusion of image and depth sensing. We present the results of a user study showing that while users' choices of artifacts were seen to follow an unexpected pattern, various artifacts were appropriated and improvised as tangibles, and the system was found to be both usable and well able to support user collaboration.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

abstract = {In this article, we report on methodological reflections that emerged during community-based co-design workshops exploring maternal and child health challenges across four provinces in rural and urban South Africa. Based on these workshops, we present how cultural norms such as hlonipha facilitated learning opportunities for participants’ engagement with gender norms and relations with community leaders and senior members of the community. We also describe stark contrasts with regards to cultural norms between rural and urban sites and their implications for co-design activities. By reflecting on the multi-linguistic, social, and cultural challenges conducting workshops across geographic locations, we discuss how cultural nuances influenced co-design workshops and artefacts. Adjustments to the rhythms of the workshops and co-design activities enabled ”transferability” between rural and urban settings, and across diverse cultures, regardless of whether these settings include members from the same cultures.},

abstract = {We collected and analyzed Instagram direct messages (DMs) from 173 youth aged 13–21 (including 86 LGBTQ+ youth). We examined youth’s risk-flagged social media trace data with their self-reported mental health outcomes to examine how the differing online experiences of LGBTQ+ youth compare with their heterosexual counterparts. We found that LGBTQ+ youth experienced significantly more high-risk online interactions compared to heterosexual youth. LGBTQ+ youth reported overall poorer mental health, with online harassment specifically amplifying Self-Harm and Injury. LGBTQ+ youth’s mental well-being linked positively to sexual messages, unlike heterosexual youth. Qualitatively, we found that most of the risk-flagged messages of LGBTQ+ youth were sexually motivated; however, a silver lining was that they sought support for their sexual identity from peers on the platform. The study highlights the importance of tailored online safety and inclusive design for LGBTQ+ youth, with implications for CHI community advancements in fostering a supportive online environments.Content Warning: This research discusses sensitive topics, including explicit sexual content, abusive language, and homophobic slurs, which may cause discomfort.

We must also consider the unique contexts of each healthcare setting. This paper presents a typology for HIS design to support collaborative healthcare teams. The typology provides considerations for processes, information, and contextual factors related to HIS design.

An in-depth understanding of the perceived risk factors and needs from the perspective of both recruiters and job seekers is needed. We address this through an interview study in the high-tech industry to compare and contrast the concerns of these two roles. We found that the importance of clarifying position requirements and assessing candidates as “whole individuals” are commonly discussed by both recruiters and job seekers. In contrast, while recruiters tended to be more aware of cognitive bias and desired more tool support during interviews, job seekers voiced more desire towards a healthy candidate-company relationship. Additionally, both roles considered the uncertainty of the current technology capability and reduced human contact as concerns for using automated tools. Based on these results, we provided design implications for automated recruitment tools and related decision-support technologies.},

In a within-subjects study with 14&nbsp;groups&nbsp;(N=117), we observed that the system made presenters significantly more aware of their audience, speak for a longer period of time, and self-assess the quality of their talk more similarly to the audience members, compared to two control conditions&nbsp;(randomly-selected spotlight and default platform UI).

abstract = {With the continued proliferation of drones, unmanned aerial vehicles, additional uses for them are growing and the demand for their services is on the rise. We present AnDrone, a drone-as-a-service solution that makes drones accessible in the cloud. AnDrone pairs a cloud service with the first drone virtualization architecture. This enables a physical drone to run multiple virtual drones simultaneously in an isolated and secure manner at little additional cost, as computational costs are cheap compared to the operational and energy costs of putting a drone in the air. AnDrone virtualizes drones using a novel Linux container architecture. Android Things virtual drone containers provide a familiar user and development environment that can run existing Android apps. A real-time Linux flight controller container supports existing drone flight software and provides virtual drones with geofenced flight control. A device container transparently multiplexes access from virtual drones to a full range of drone hardware devices, including cameras and other sensors. Upon flight completion, virtual drones and their data can be uploaded to the cloud for offline access. We have implemented an AnDrone prototype based on Raspberry Pi 3 drone hardware. We demonstrate that it incurs minimal runtime performance and energy overhead, supports real-time virtual drone flight control, and runs untrusted third-party software in virtual drones in a secure manner while ensuring that the service provider maintains control of the drone hardware.},

abstract = {School refusal is a complex issue which typically develops in adolescence, often in the context of anxiety and depressive disorders. While parents and educators play a critical role in supporting these adolescents, they need guidance to work together to overcome the problem. Our study explores how technology can be designed to help parents and educators work together in supporting adolescents who refuse school. We first conducted 14 interviews with parents which highlighted that empathic understanding and communication between parents and the educators is key to supporting adolescents with school refusal. Subsequently, we conducted co-design workshops with three parents, three adolescents and five educators. Our workshop findings show that reactive and problem-focused communication can undermine trust-building and progress towards supporting the adolescent. Drawing on these findings, we formulate design implications that can enable empathic parent-adolescent-educator partnerships, provide holistic support for parents, and facilitate individual tailoring for diverse parent-adolescent journeys.},

In this work, we present a prototype called "PlayBetter", an application that can help childcare bystander parents easily play with their baby. Based on the results of the preliminary study, two modes were designed to motivate parents to play with their baby, and to support their efforts to do so: (1) baby play supporter; and (2) motivational message notification. A pilot study was conducted (n=6) with the prototype, and the study participants' feedback that can improve the system are reported.},

abstract = {AI-powered educational technology that is designed to support teachers in providing personalized instruction can enhance their ability to address the needs of individual students, hopefully leading to better learning gains. This paper presents results from a participatory research aimed at co-designing with science teachers a learning analytics tool that will assist them in implementing a personalized pedagogy in blended learning contexts. The development process included three stages. In the first, we interviewed a group of teachers to identify where and how personalized instruction may be integrated into their teaching practices. This yielded a clustering-based personalization strategy. Next, we designed a mock-up of a learning analytics tool that supports this strategy and worked with another group of teachers to define an ‘explainable learning analytics’ scheme that explains each cluster in a way that is both pedagogically meaningful and can be generated automatically. Third, we developed an AI algorithm that supports this ‘explainable clusters’ pedagogy and conducted a controlled experiment that evaluated its contribution to teachers’ ability to plan personalized learning sequences. The planned sequences were evaluated in a blinded fashion by an expert, and the results demonstrated that the experimental group – teachers who received the clusters with the explanations – designed sequences that addressed the difficulties exhibited by different groups of students better than those designed by teachers who received the clusters without explanations. The main contribution of this study is twofold. First, it presents an effective personalization approach that fits blended learning in the science classroom, which combines a real-time clustering algorithm with an explainable-AI scheme that can automatically build pedagogically meaningful explanations from item-level meta-data (Q Matrix). Second, it demonstrates how such an end-to-end learning analytics solution can be built with teachers through a co-design process and highlights the types of knowledge that teachers add to system-provided analytics in order to apply them to their local context. As a practical contribution, this process informed the design of a new learning analytics tool that was integrated into a free online learning platform that is being used by more than 1000 science teachers.},

In this paper we prototype one such news discovery tool, Algorithm Tips, which we designed to help journalists find newsworthy leads about algorithmic decision-making systems used across all levels of U.S. government. The tool incorporates algorithmic, crowdsourced, and expert evaluations into an integrated interface designed to support users in making editorial decisions about which news leads to pursue. We then present an evaluation of our prototype based on an extended deployment with eight professional journalists. Our findings offer insights into journalistic practices that are enabled and transformed by such news discovery tools, and suggest opportunities for improving computational news discovery tool designs to better support those practices.},

abstract = {Structured Query Language (SQL) skills are crucial in software engineering and computer science. However, teaching SQL effectively requires both pedagogical skill and considerable knowledge of the language. Educators and scholars have proposed numerous considerations for the betterment of SQL education, yet these considerations may be too numerous and scattered among different fora for educators to find and internalize, as no systematic mappings or literature reviews regarding SQL education have been conducted. The two main goals of this mapping study are to provide an overview of educational SQL research topics, research types, and publication fora, and to collect and propagate SQL teaching practices for educators to utilize. Additionally, we present a short future research agenda based on insights from the mapping process. We conducted a systematic mapping study complemented by snowballing techniques to identify applicable primary studies. We classified the primary studies according to research type and utilized directed content analysis to classify the primary studies by their topic. Out of our selected 89 primary studies, we identified six recurring topics: (i) student errors in query formulation; (ii) characteristics and presentation of the exercise database; (iii) specific and (iv) non-specific teaching approach suggestions; (v) patterns and visualization; and (vi) easing teacher workload. We list 66 teaching approaches the primary studies argued for (and in some cases against). For researchers, we provide a systematic map of educational SQL research and future research agenda. For educators, we present an aggregated body of knowledge on teaching practices in SQL education over a time frame of 30 years. In conclusion, we suggest that replication studies, studies on advanced SQL concepts, and studies on aspects other than data retrieval are needed to further educational SQL research.},

abstract = {Traditional design galleries enable users to search for examples based on surface attributes (e.g., color or style), and largely obscure underlying principles (e.g., hierarchy or readability). We conducted three studies to explore how galleries could be constructed to help novices learn key design principles. Study 1 revealed that novices gain perspective by observing how designs evolve throughout a process. Study 2 found that novices are better at identifying design issues when viewing iterations that show improvements for just one principle at a time, rather than multiple. Building on these insights, we created ProcessGallery, a tool that enables users to browse contrasting pairs of early-and-late iterations of designs that highlight key improvements organized by design principles. In Study 3, a within-subjects experiment, sixteen participants iterated on a seed design after viewing examples in ProcessGallery versus a traditional gallery. Using ProcessGallery, participants found more appropriate examples, assessed designs better, and preferred ProcessGallery for learning compared to a traditional gallery.},

abstract = {A crucial building block of responsible artificial intelligence is responsible data governance, including data collection. Its importance is also underlined in the latest EU regulations. The data should be of high quality, foremost correct and representative, and individuals providing the data should have autonomy over what data is collected. In this article, we consider the setting of collecting personally measured fitness data (physical activity measurements), in which some individuals may not have an incentive to measure and report accurate data. This can significantly degrade the quality of the collected data. On the other hand, high-quality collective data of this nature could be used for reliable scientific insights or to build trustworthy artificial intelligence applications. We conduct a framed field experiment (N = 691) to examine the effect of offering fixed and quality-dependent monetary incentives on the quality of the collected data. We use a peer-based incentive-compatible mechanism for the quality-dependent incentives without spot-checking or surveilling individuals. We find that the incentive-compatible mechanism can elicit good-quality data while providing a good user experience and compensating fairly, although, in the specific study context, the data quality does not necessarily differ under the two incentive schemes. We contribute new design insights from the experiment and discuss directions that future field experiments and applications on explainable and transparent data collection may focus on.},

The study also determined the significant difference in students' academic performance based on the learning capacity of students and the significant relationship and effects of learning capacity to academic performance. The respondents for this research were 100 undergraduate students from the Philippines enrolled in either private or state universities. For the research tool, the Learning Capacity Questionnaire was utilized. The researchers used descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. Based on the results gathered, all factors provided by the researchers for the respondents were significant in the learning capacity of students. Regarding the 2 Sample T-test, the internet speed and access to learning materials have significant effects on academic performance. For the correlation analysis, there was a high Pearson correlation coefficient in factors such as adequate learning materials vs academic performance, reliable and fast internet connection vs academic performance, enough time and resources vs physical and mental capacity, and teacher's skills and resources vs school infrastructure. Lastly, adequate learning materials and physical and mental health capacity were the significant factors upon establishing the regression equation.},

abstract = {Though many people report an interest in self-limiting certain aspects of their phone use, challenges adhering to self-defined limits are common. We conducted a design exercise and online survey to map the design space of interventions for smartphone non-use and distilled these into a small taxonomy of intervention categories. Using these findings, we implemented "MyTime," an intervention to support people in achieving goals related to smartphone non-use. We conducted a deployment study with 23 participants over two weeks and found that participants reduced their time with the apps they feel are a poor use of time by 21% while their use of the apps they feel are a good use of time remained unchanged. We found that a small taxonomy describes users' diverse set of desired behavior changes relating to smartphone non-use, and that these desired changes predict: 1) the hypothetical features they are interested in trying, 2) the extent to which they engage with these features in practice, and 3) their changes in behavior in response to the intervention. We link users' desired behaviors to the categories of our design taxonomy, providing a foundation for a theoretical model of designing for smartphone non-use.},

We identify seven key challenges: massive volume and variety of data, complexity in identifying stressors, scalability of space, multifaceted relationship between stress and time, a need for representation at multiple granularities, inter-person variability, and limited understanding of JITAI design requirements due to its novelty. We propose four new visualizations based on one million minutes of sensor data (n=70). We evaluate our visualizations with stress researchers (n=6) to gain first insights into its usability and usefulness in JITAI design. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal visualizations help identify and explain between- and within-person variability in stress patterns and contextual visualizations enable decisions regarding the timing, content, and modality of intervention. Interestingly, a granular representation is considered informative but noise-prone; an abstract representation is the preferred starting point for designing JITAIs.},

abstract = {As per the WHO statistics, the risk of pregnancy-related deaths is much higher for girls aged 15--19 compared to women in their twenties. `Peer Couple to Couple Approach' (PCCA) can be a sustainable, community led approach, involving both the partners of young couples (the wife and husband) as a `dyad', to overcome the socio-cultural and gender related barriers to plan and space their families and achieve positive maternal health outcomes. Working with both the wife and the husband, the approach aims to empower women and work with men to make them more gender equitable. This approach challenges existing norms by working with this `dyad' and not just targeting women, reinforcing the need for women's empowerment, joint decision-making and male engagement in contraceptive use. This paper describes the PCCA approach and the use of digital technology as a process enabler for deploying at scale in rural areas, based on a field pilot in the state of Jharkhand, India.},

In particular, we examine the extent to which specialized features of an SNS can engage users in communicating with their network members to get advice in varied situations. Our findings indicate that technology-supported communication particularly strengthened the relationship between the individual and extended network members, mitigating concerns about over-reliance on primary caregivers.

abstract = {Virtual academic networking is socio-technically challenging, however, fruitful for researchers' success. We introduce a system called Who2chat to tackle the challenge and facilitate connections of researchers in virtual social hours. Who2chat allows academic researchers to create a research profile and express their research interests, find researchers with similar interests, overcome social barriers, and coordinate and start video chats, all within a single interface. We engaged in an iterative design process by deploying Who2chat at academic conferences. In our preliminary deployment (N=80), we found that researchers often have difficulty finding other researchers who share similar interests, and they are shy about reaching out to other researchers. Inspired by this, we implemented social-signaling features to Who2chat and ran our first deployment (N=220). Our results highlight that the interface allowed users to find relevant researchers and helped them feel confident in joining conversations. However, this led to large group conversations where discussion topics were more superficial. In response, we developed and deployed our second interface (N=81). Key improvements were managing the size of conversations, dynamically determining and allowing individuals to join a conversation based on their relevance to the ongoing discussion, and maintaining the ratio of senior and junior members, to further enhance the quality of discussions. As a result, participants were able to meet more people and engage in more meaningful conversations. Our work demonstrates an interface design for social networking in academic settings and how to lower social barriers in virtual networking.},

Young people may fall into poverty due to various reasons: student debt, unemployment, and unpredictable events such as the pandemic. Therefore, education to improve their financial competence is necessary to increase their resilience to those risks and pressures. We analysed 62 participants’ questionnaire data and found that most participants struggle with making optimal financial decisions when spending. With this in mind, we designed a system that uses machine learning to analyse users’ previous spending habits and models it against a decision tree framework to calculate the most optimal decision within users’ budgets. The system used affective interaction and anthropomorphic communication to educate users in real-time shopping environments, for example when they’re shopping in a grocery store. Our user testing demonstrated that the design was helpful with cognitive offload and encouraged critical thinking when making purchasing decisions. Furthermore, our design idea sheds light on possible approaches to applying virtual AI assistants to improve skills when lacking resources such as time, place, or human experts.},

abstract = {Traditional evaluation of students' learning primarily relies on assessing learning outcomes through either summative or formative assessment methods. In these approaches, the primary emphasis is on the students' learning outcome, rather than the learning process. However, assessing the learning process is as important since it allows providing timely feedback which can directly impact students' learning outcomes. One of the known approaches to getting information about the learning process is the use of formative reflection tools, which also help students in developing their meta-cognitive skills. One effective method for formative reflection is the Minute Paper technique which asks students two concise questions after each class session: what they have learned and what challenges they have encountered. While Minute Papers encourage brief responses, the analysis process can become time-consuming as the number of students and class sessions grows. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based reflection analysis tool designed to assess the challenging topics students encounter during each class session. This tool suggests additional learning modules for students to study based on the frequency of the challenging topics. To achieve this, the model utilizes a local repository of lecture materials to create query contexts, which are then input into the LLM as prompts. Students are given access to these recommended resources for further learning, and they are encouraged to provide feedback after completing these modules. These data-driven recommended learning resources serve as continuous content delivery channels to foster a deeper understanding of the subjects at hand.},

abstract = {Context: Deep learning (DL) techniques have gained significant popularity among software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering effort and complex domain knowledge.Objective: Although many DL studies have reported substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness, they often ignore two factors: (1) reproducibility—whether the reported experimental results can be obtained by other researchers using authors’ artifacts (i.e., source code and datasets) with the same experimental setup; and (2) replicability—whether the reported experimental result can be obtained by other researchers using their re-implemented artifacts with a different experimental setup. We observed that DL studies commonly overlook these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future work. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set parameters and the time-consuming optimization process, unlike classical supervised machine learning (ML) methods (e.g., random forest). This study aims to investigate the urgency and importance of reproducibility and replicability for DL studies on SE tasks.Method: In this study, we conducted a literature review on 147 DL studies recently published in 20 SE venues and 20 AI (Artificial Intelligence) venues to investigate these issues. We also re-ran four representative DL models in SE to investigate important factors that may strongly affect the reproducibility and replicability of a study.Results: Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these two factors in SE, where only 10.2% of the studies investigate any research question to show that their models can address at least one issue of replicability and/or reproducibility. More than 62.6% of the studies do not even share high-quality source code or complete data to support the reproducibility of their complex models. Meanwhile, our experimental results show the importance of reproducibility and replicability, where the reported performance of a DL model could not be reproduced for an unstable optimization process. Replicability could be substantially compromised if the model training is not convergent, or if performance is sensitive to the size of vocabulary and testing data.Conclusion: It is urgent for the SE community to provide a long-lasting link to a high-quality reproduction package, enhance DL-based solution stability and convergence, and avoid performance sensitivity on different sampled data.},

Youth used the platform to seek support (83%), connect with others (15%), and give advice (5%) about sexting, their sexual orientation, sexual abuse, and explicit content. Females often received unwanted nudes from strangers and struggled with how to turn down sexting requests from people they knew. Meanwhile, others who sought support complained that they received unwanted sexual solicitations while doing so-to the point that adolescents gave advice to one another on which users to stay away from. Our research provides insight into the online sexual experiences of adolescents and how they seek support around these issues.

This paper presents the iterative development, including an early validation trial, of an HCI-focused collaborative brainstorming approach to identify deviations from design intent that harm people. The established Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) guide word based method, not applied before in a HCI context beyond safety-critical systems despite extensive use in other disciplines, has been adapted and applied. Motivated by the need to enumerate impacts of technology on marginalised individuals and their communities, and utilising the lead author's previous experience, a more human-orientated ‘HCI HAZOP’ was investigated. Using two feasibility studies and two pilot studies, the adapted method has been trialled, evaluated and refined. The studies' findings demonstrate the usefulness of the method identifying undesirable consequences, even by novel practitioners without any prior training. The paper presents the adaption as a methodological contribution, an application of ‘HCI HAZOP’ through studies using scenario-based design artifacts identifying limitations and benefits, and guidance materials for use by other researchers.},

abstract = {Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have potential to provide effective and accessible care to entire populations, but low client uptake and engagement are significant problems. Few prior studies explore the lived experiences of non-engagers, because reaching this population is inherently difficult. We present an observational inquiry into the barriers to sign-up and early use of a DMHI, along with reasons for initial interest in the DMHI. We collected 205 online questionnaire responses and 20 interviews from self-referring participants across four healthcare ecosystems in the UK and US. Questionnaire results revealed that uncertainty about DMHI usefulness and usability were the main barriers to uptake, whereas forgetting about it, not finding time for it and not finding it useful were the main barriers to early engagement. Participants reported multiple reasons for considering the DMHI, reflecting the contextual, subjective nature of mental health. Our thematic analysis generated themes around (1) the need for human connection, (2) the impact of self-stigma on help-seeking, (3) the lack of knowledge around DMHIs and psychological therapy, (4) the desire for personally relevant care, and (5) the fluctuating, perennial nature of mental health. We discuss implications for DMHI design, implementation and future research, as well as transdisciplinary opportunities.},

EAST is an intermediary interactive tablet based app that assists in the early-detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by screening preschoolers in Pakistan through play-based activities in a home, school or clinical setting. Medical professionals, parents of autistic children and teachers were surveyed through focus groups to understand the reasons that contribute to the increasing number of missed early detections, and late- or misdiagnoses. We also evaluate the acceptability, usability and validity of our tool. We tested EAST with both typically developed and autistic children on how they relate to people, imitation, motor skills, visual and intellectual response. They were scored via time taken, the number of wrong attempts, or incorrect answers and audiovisual feedback. This paper contributes towards a digital autism screening tool that delivers insights into the child's behaviour and enables collaboration among parents, teachers and medical professionals.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is popular for large-scale data collection and labeling, but a major challenge is on detecting low-quality submissions. Recent studies have demonstrated that behavioral features of workers are highly correlated with data quality and can be useful in quality control. However, these studies primarily leveraged coarsely extracted behavioral features, and did not further explore quality control at the fine-grained level, i.e., the annotation unit level. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and benefits of using fine-grained behavioral features, which are the behavioral features finely extracted from a worker's individual interactions with each single unit in a subtask, for quality control in crowdsourcing. We design and implement a framework named Fine-grained Behavior-based Quality Control (FBQC) that specifically extracts fine-grained behavioral features to provide three quality control mechanisms: (1) quality prediction for objective tasks, (2) suspicious behavior detection for subjective tasks, and (3) unsupervised worker categorization. Using the FBQC framework, we conduct two real-world crowdsourcing experiments and demonstrate that using fine-grained behavioral features is feasible and beneficial in all three quality control mechanisms. Our work provides clues and implications for helping job requesters or crowdsourcing platforms to further achieve better quality control.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

abstract = {In multiplayer online games, players from different cultural backgrounds come together to cooperate and compete in real time. Although these games are enjoyed by billions of players globally, behavioral issues such as toxic behavior (TB) have become rampant in some games, perhaps most infamously in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, such as League of Legends and Dota 2. A crucial step in curbing TB lies in understanding its drivers and antecedents. In the present work, we contribute to this field of research by considering the regional offline cultural environment in which players live. We draw both on Hofstede's Cultural Dimension Framework and on Kordyaka et al.’s Unified Theory of Toxic Behavior (UTTB) to compare two cross-sectional samples of MOBA players: one from North America (n = 155) and one from India (n = 119). Our analysis reveals significant differences between the samples for all UTTB variables. Additional analyses also indicate the relevance of national culture in relation to other dispositions (i.e., age) and characteristics (i.e., game-related culture). Our findings underscore the role that the offline cultural environments play in TB in MOBAs and additionally open avenues for further research that takes dimensions of national culture in the study of online behavior into account.},

Formative assessment by constant monitoring of the intellectual achievement of real-world learners is essential for adaptive learning support, but no assessment methodology has yet been developed. We consider a method to systematically integrate heterogeneous factors of real-world learning: learners' internal situations, their external situations, and their learning field. Then, we propose a method for formatively assessing the situation of real-world learning. The method enables us to recognize the sequence of characteristic stay behavior and the associated body posture of a learner, and to estimate the 3D location of his/her interest. The method enables the estimation of not only the learning topic that a learner is currently examining in a field but also the prospective topics that he/she should learn. Our assessment method is the basis for context-aware support to promote the emergence of new knowledge from intellectual collaboration in the world.},

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

abstract = {Cloud Computing skills have been increasing in demand. Many software engineers are learning these skills and taking cloud certification examinations to be job competitive. Preparing undergraduates to be cloud-certified remains challenging as cloud computing is a relatively new topic in the computing curriculum, and many of these certifications require working experience. In this paper, we report our experiences designing a course with experiential learning to prepare our computing undergraduates to take the cloud certification. We adopt a university project-based experiential learning framework to engage industry partners who provide project requirements for students to develop cloud solutions and an experiential risk learning model to design the course contents. We prepare these students to take on the Amazon Web Services Solution Architect - Associate (AWS-SAA) while doing the course. We do this over 3 semester terms and report our findings before and after our design with experiential learning. We are motivated by the students' average 93% passing rates over the terms. Even when the certification is taken out of the graded components, we still see an encouraging 89% participation rate. The quantitative feedback shows increased ratings across the survey questions compared to before experiential learning. We acknowledge concerns about the students' heavy workload and increased administrative efforts for the faculty members. We summarise our approach with actionable weekly topics, activities and takeaways. We hope this experience report can help other educators design cloud computing content and certifications for computing students in software engineering.},

This makes the overall process unpredictable, even when a sound, user-centred design approach is followed by an experienced team of UX designers. Moreover, when such systems are deployed, the complexity of the resulting interactions challenges any attempt to generalisation from retrospective analysis. In this paper, we present a case study of the largest single platform of citizen driven data analysis projects to date, the Zooniverse. By eliciting, through structured reflection, experiences of core members of its design team, our grounded analysis yielded four sets of themes, focusing on Task Specificity, Community Development, Task Design and Public Relations and Engagement, supported by two-to-four specific design claims each. For each, we propose a set of design claims (DCs), drawing comparisons to the literature on crowdsourcing and online communities to contextualise our findings.},

abstract = {During the pandemic, university teachers have been tasked to maintain teaching activities through alternative formats using online teaching. Unlike others, learning in language education occurs mainly through classroom interactions between human agencies which are disrupted in the online environment. Grounded on the teacher efficacy framework, this study investigated university language teacher efficacy in the adoption of emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. A mixed methods approach was adopted in response to the calls from academia for narrative studies on the topic. A sample of 84 university language teachers retrospectively reported their online teaching capabilities during the pandemic for descriptive and inferential analyses, through which three groups were identified via two-step clustering. 13 follow-up interviews were subsequently conducted for thematic analysis. Three groups were found to adapt differently to the online environment. This study unveiled that teacher efficacy in ERT is related to that in face-to-face teaching because of intact curricula during ERT, and suggested language centers acting as an intermediary between high-inertia universities and teachers to provide timely conditions for learning for reskilling and upskilling teachers on engaging pedagogies and to facilitate the organic growth of the community of practice for better formal and informal peer-to-peer learning.},

In response to our findings, we developed a wellness application named WellConn, which is tailored to provide more effective and efficient care to students aged 14-18 who are struggling with mental health issues. The primary goal of WellConn is to mitigate uncertainties surrounding mental health concerns among students and address the delayed care-giving process that often occurs during the transition to university. This intervention aims to support students in navigating the new university environment while addressing both pre-existing concerns from high school and emerging issues during the transitional period.},

abstract = {Pregnancy loss is a common yet stigmatized experience. We investigate (non)disclosure of pregnancy loss among LGBTQ people to known ties on identified social media as well as what constitutes ideal socio-technical disclosure environments. LGBTQ persons experiencing loss face intersectional stigma for holding a marginalized sexual and/or gender identity and experiencing pregnancy loss. We interviewed 17 LGBTQ people in the U.S. who used social media and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. We demonstrate how the Disclosure Decision-Making (DDM) framework explains LGBTQ pregnancy loss (non)disclosure decisions, thereby asserting the framework's ability to explain (non)disclosure decisions for those facing intersectional stigma. We illustrate how one's LGBTQ identity shapes (non)disclosure decisions of loss. We argue that social media platforms can better facilitate disclosures about silenced topics by enabling selective disclosure, enabling proxy content moderation, providing education about silenced experiences, and prioritizing such disclosures in news feeds. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.},

abstract = {Gesture-based interaction constitutes the prominent interaction modality for Augmented Reality (AR) systems. In this state-of-the-art review, we classify the recent literature on hand gesture-based AR interaction techniques, concerning the various domains where AR is gaining a foothold. Based on the conducted analysis, a taxonomy is introduced for the classification of the various reported techniques on the grounds of their application domain, the context of use, gestures recognition method, and types of gestures used. Furthermore, the discussed analysis reveals that context of use is a factor to take into account when determining the gestures that should be employed when developing an AR application. At the same time, there is a trade-off between touch-based and mid-air gestures, regarding their simplicity and user engagement entailed, which needs to be carefully considered. In all cases, it is of utmost importance that AR gesture-based systems are designed following a human-centered approach. The analysis conducted and reported in this paper aims to motivate the informed development and integration of hand gesture interaction of AR applications in various contexts and provide information on the different approaches that can be employed.},

Barriers such as desire discrepancy, lack of communication, changing needs, and habituality interfere with sexual desire and relationship satisfaction. This paper explores whether technology has a role in supporting and increasing sexual desire or developing an understanding of different individual needs towards sexual desire within couples’ relationships and how it can do so. To explore this, we conducted a survey (n=77) and interview study (n=12). Results show that participants wanted a shared, dedicated, and protected space to playfully explore their individual desire with each other. They felt technology could facilitate a better understanding of their evolving needs as a couple, motivate open sexual communication, bring spontaneity, and hands-on exploration; however, technology should not inflict judgement or obligations on desire levels; it should help to understand and situate differing needs in a relationship meaningfully. We share our reflections on the role of technology and raise important considerations in such technology design.},

However, the majority of those who are unemployed, e.g., individuals who have limited education or who are racial and ethnic minorities, are not well supported by existing digital employment tools. Therefore, we conducted an 8-month randomized field experiment to evaluate two tools-Review-Me and Interview4-designed to address these job seekers' key employment needs. We used the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine the tools' effects on three factors influencing job seekers' job search intention: job search self-efficacy, subjective norms, and job search attitudes. Our interview data suggested that the tools positively affected all factors, but our survey results were mixed. Interview results suggest that these trends were caused by positive feedback and self-reflection. We contribute ways to integrate these two features into future tools for, and techniques to increase study retention among, underrepresented job seekers.},

Efficient system designs necessitate understanding the power signature of current supercomputing workloads. Additionally, that understanding will enable power efficiency improvements in existing systems. With advancements in power measurement and data collection techniques, many computing centers, including NERSC, collect a vast amount of data every second, including power usage and other performance metrics. However, access is not straightforward, being a time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose NPAT, a power analysis tool that aims to provide easy access to power usage data on the web. It provides a quick and accessible way to view the power usage data of NERSC systems, jobs, and applications. Being implemented in PHP, Javascript, and Python with open-source libraries and modules, it promises effortless portability to other sites.},

The problem was the lack of conclusive research about the effects of digital assistive technologies for educating deaf learners in Sub-Saharan African countries, such as Namibia. The question was could a digital assistive technology improve the mathematics achievement of deaf children? The research objective was to gather scientific evidence by conducting a quantitative experiment with constructivist digital assistive technology and qualitative interviews with the teachers involved. The findings from the experiment suggest that the constructivist digital assistive technology may have had a positive effect on the mathematics achievement of the learners, which was supported by the findings from the interviews. This makes an original contribution to the domain and offers an intervention that was feasible, practical and potentially effective for improving the teaching and learning of mathematics for deaf learners.},

Findings showed that healthcare practitioners face challenges during the implementation of HIT that affected their acceptance and adoption of the system. In addition, negative perceptions by some healthcare practitioners towards HIT was revealed. Lastly, there was ample perception of healthcare practitioners resisting HIT. This study highlights the significance of properly planning the HIT implementation by employers. There needs to be engagement and involvement of the key users of the HIT so that they take ownership and accept the system.

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic led to dire consequences globally, and it has been particularly challenging for older adults. They are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes of the disease citecdc_covid. Older adults also use less technology than other age groups citetech_old, so they mostly rely on in-person interactions and services for social support. However, disease mitigation efforts such as social distancing and self-quarantining severely limited in-person interactions, hindering older adults' social support during the COVID-19 crisis. In this paper, we present findings on social support realities from semi-structured interviews with older adults (N=15) living alone in community dwellings. We found that older adults' support roles, support sources, and support concerns evolve as they passed through this time of sweeping change. They are enthusiastic about providing support to people who are older and more vulnerable than themselves. At the same time, their needs for safety, autonomy, and independence create tensions around social support. We propose a framework to illustrate the evolving ecology of social support that can facilitate the holistic design of socio-technical support systems for older adults. We argue against the societal portrayal of older adults as vulnerable individuals. Rather, there is an opportunity to design support systems considering them as anchors in society. Towards that goal, we present design implications for future socio-technical support systems to empower older adults to age in place during a crisis.},

Through ideation sessions among researchers and feedback from the participants, we formulate the design space for SwarmFidget, where swarm robots are used to facilitate programmable actuated fidgeting. To gather user impressions, we conducted an exploratory study where we introduced the concept of SwarmFidget to twelve participants and had them experience and provide feedback on six example fidgeting interactions. Our study demonstrates the potential of SwarmFidget for facilitating fidgeting interaction and provides insights and guidelines for designing effective and engaging fidgeting interactions with swarm robots.

Despite recent work in this area, the extent to which intelligent virtual agents can facilitate improvements in the collaborative behavior of children is largely unknown. This study employed a wizard-of-oz study design and investigated elementary children's collaborative behavior after interacting with virtual agents. These agents model exploratory talk for upper elementary school dyads, such as asking higher-order questions and listening to their partners. The findings uncover associations between elementary learner dyads' positive changes in collaboration after agent interventions, the dyads' affective reactions to interventions, and their attentiveness to the agents. Our results also reveal associations between positive changes in collaboration and the timing of interventions: for example, earlier interventions had a higher occurrence of positive changes, and positive changes in collaboration typically happened within five seconds of interventions. The results suggest ways in which intelligent virtual agents may be used to promote effective collaborative learning practices for children.},

abstract = {Fine motor skills, including grasping, manipulating, and reaching for objects, are a documented weakness for many children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, relatively less research has attempted to address these motor deficits, especially by taking advantage of advanced technology. To explore potential mechanisms for expanding accessibility to fine motor intervention for people with ASD, we present the design and implementation of a feasibility study of a novel Haptic-Gripper Virtual Reality System (Hg). Hg is capable of providing analysis and practice opportunities of fine motor skills in an adaptive and low-cost virtual environment with real-time auditory, visual, and haptic feedback. The Haptic Gripper in Hg can detect a user's grip force and hand location and provide haptic feedback to guide hand movement and grip control while completing several simple and engaging virtual fine motor tasks. We conducted a feasibility study with six children with ASD and six typically developing (TD) children and found that participants were interested in using the Haptic Gripper and could quickly get used to the system. Although the results are preliminary and limited, we observed medium to strong correlations between the proposed fine motor skill metrics and the scores achieved with a standardized fine motor skill test and improvements of participants in accuracy and steadiness of movement and force control. This study provides important guidance for future investigations of the Hg's potential for assessing and improving fine motor manipulation skills.},

abstract = {Increasingly, older adults are shopping via mobile devices as technology has been incorporated into their lives. When older adults adopt and use mobile shopping, social interactions with close others greatly influence their experience. Therefore, this paper aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how social interactions with close others shaped older adults’ mobile shopping practices. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 31 older adults who reported using mobile shopping regularly. We found that older adults engaged in three types of social interaction: learning from, collaborating with, and assisting close others in adopting and using mobile shopping. Through these social interactions, they gradually built trust in mobile shopping systems and supported each other’s decision-making processes. In conclusion, we presented design implications for facilitating social interactions to improve older adults’ mobile shopping experience.},

abstract = {The demand for skilled workers in computing continues to outpace the supply of qualified graduates. Despite the need, hiring can be challenging, both for employers seeking prospective employees and for students who may be unsure where to apply, daunted by technical interviews, and/or feeling the effects of imposter phenomena. In this experience report, we describe a program established to reduce some of these hurdles by pairing (n = 63) undergraduate students with (n = 7) companies to offer short-term computing internships, called a Sprinternship. Sprinternships eliminated the hurdle of technical interviews, provided students with training beforehand to offer foundational knowledge, and placed them in teams to work on challenge projects. We describe the details of the program and our investigation of its impact. Social Cognitive Career Theory guided the inquiry as we took a mixed-methods approach to understand the students' experiences and the potential impact on their self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and career goals. Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in students' confidence in computing, something echoed in their open-ended responses. Thematic analysis further yielded that Sprinternships were meaningful in two major areas: Goals and Learning Experiences. The program aided in students' self-discovery, made them feel accomplished, and strengthened their industry ambitions. Responses also revealed positive and negative programmatic aspects to consider for future iterations. We hope that our description of the Sprinternships, findings, and recommendations can be useful to other practitioners looking to engage students with practical learning and enhance their graduate employability.},

While prior studies have developed a variety of stand-alone techniques to combat technology overuse, little work has been done to build interventions directly into technologies to regulate usage. In this study, we designed three interventions that remind players to take a break in a casual mobile game. We explored players’ experiences with these interventions through a 4-day deployment study and follow-up interviews (N=16). Findings suggest that while some players had a positive experience with the game that had built-in interventions, others experienced unintended outcomes such as disrupted immersion or longer play sessions. We also found that interventions seemed to be more likely to succeed when players experienced a sense of accomplishment or negative emotions. We discuss the implications of the study and provide preliminary suggestions for designing built-in interventions.},

Scholars have sought to understand social media’s role in mental health issues, but limited work has explored TikTok—the video-centric social media platform that is popular with youth—and people’s connections around psychiatric hospitalization experiences. In this study, we used qualitative content analysis to examine a random sample of 140 TikTok posts related to psychiatric hospitalization. We found that members of this population frequently utilize humor to create and maintain a positive and supportive community with each other. We also describe how TikTok’s design affords these interactions among community members, and conclude with a series of provocations for researchers and designers working at the intersections of social media and mental illness. We hope our study provides insights for how to further support rather than just censor youth in using creative outlets to connect with each other.},

abstract = {Student engagement has been identified as a critical construct for understanding and predicting educational success. However, research has shown that it can be hard to align data-driven insights of engagement with observed and self-reported levels of engagement. Given the emergence and increasing application of learning analytics (LA) within K-12 education, further research is needed to understand how engagement is being conceptualized and measured within LA research. This scoping review identifies and synthesizes literature published between 2011-2022, focused on LA and student engagement in K-12 contexts, and indexed in five international databases. 27 articles and conference papers from 13 different countries were included for review. We found that most of the research was undertaken in middle school years within STEM subjects. The results show that there is a wide discrepancy in researchers’ understanding and operationalization of engagement and little evidence to suggest that LA improves learning outcomes and support. However, the potential to do so remains strong. Guidance is provided for future LA engagement research to better align with these goals.},

Mothers utilize social media and online forums throughout postpartum to seek mental health support. In this paper, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics of naturally occurring online discussions and the online social support dynamics associated with PPD. We qualitatively analyze posts and comments from three postpartum depression support communities corresponding to well-known online social platforms (Reddit, What to expect, and Babycenter). We discovered that the three communities share common themes of discussion that include the causes, stressors, symptoms, and coping mechanisms for PPD. Seeking both informational and emotional support through venting and storytelling was prevalent, and emotional support seeking was more common in Reddit than the other two communities. We provide recommendations for future postpartum depression research and design considerations based on pervasive help-seeking approaches.},

In this paper we describe an integrated program of ethnographic and design work meant to understand and address such problems. For one year we conducted surveys, interviews, and focus groups around sexual harassment with women at three different universities in Dhaka. Based on this input, we developed "Protibadi", a web and mobile phone based application designed to report, map, and share women's stories around sexual harassment in public places. In August 2013 the system launched, user studies were conducted, and public responses were monitored to gauge reactions, strengths, and limits of the system. This paper describes the findings of our ethnographic and design-based work, and suggests lessons relevant to other HCI efforts to understand and design around difficult and culturally sensitive problems.},

We hope that, like us, you are looking forward to a highly productive and engaging symposium that provides ample opportunity to renew old relationships, build new connections, and learn about the latest advances in our field. While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

abstract = {Homophily - our tendency to surround ourselves with others who share our perspectives and opinions about the world - is both a part of human nature and an organizing principle underpinning many of our digital social networks. However, when it comes to politics or culture, homophily can amplify tribal mindsets and produce "echo chambers" that degrade the quality, safety, and diversity of discourse online. While several studies have empirically proven this point, few have explored how making users aware of the extent and nature of their political echo chambers influences their subsequent beliefs and actions. In this paper, we introduce Social Mirror, a social network visualization tool that enables a sample of Twitter users to explore the politically-active parts of their social network. We use Social Mirror to recruit Twitter users with a prior history of political discourse to a randomized experiment where we evaluate the effects of different treatments on participants' i) beliefs about their network connections, ii) the political diversity of who they choose to follow, and iii) the political alignment of the URLs they choose to share. While we see no effects on average political alignment of shared URLs, we find that recommending accounts of the opposite political ideology to follow reduces participants» beliefs in the political homogeneity of their network connections but still enhances their connection diversity one week after treatment. Conversely, participants who enhance their belief in the political homogeneity of their Twitter connections have less diverse network connections 2-3 weeks after treatment. We explore the implications of these disconnects between beliefs and actions on future efforts to promote healthier exchanges in our digital public spheres.},

abstract = {Much prior work on creating social agents that assist users relies on preconceived assumptions of what it means to be helpful. For example, it is common to assume that a helpful agent just assists with achieving a user’s objective. However, as assistive agents become more widespread, human-agent interactions may be more ad-hoc, providing opportunities for unexpected agent assistance. How would this affect human notions of an agent’s helpfulness? To investigate this question, we conducted an exploratory study (N=186) where participants interacted with agents displaying unexpected, assistive behaviors in a Space Invaders game and we studied factors that may influence perceived helpfulness in these interactions. Our results challenge the idea that human perceptions of the helpfulness of unexpected agent assistance can be derived from a universal, objective definition of help. Also, humans will reciprocate unexpected assistance, but might not always consider that they are in fact helping an agent. Based on our findings, we recommend considering personalization and adaptation when designing future assistive behaviors for prosocial agents that may try to help users in unexpected situations.},

abstract = {Here we model the indirect costs of deploying security controls in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) to manage cyber threats. SMEs may not have the in-house skills and collective capacity to operate controls efficiently, resulting in inadvertent data leakage and exposure to compromise. Aside from financial costs, attempts to maintain security can impact morale, system performance, and retraining requirements, which are modelled here. Managing the overall complexity and effectiveness of an SME's security controls has the potential to reduce unintended leakage. The UK Cyber Essentials Scheme informs basic control definitions, and Available Responsibility Budget (ARB) is modelled to understand how controls can be prioritised for both security and usability. Human factors of security and practical experience of security management for SMEs inform the modelling of deployment challenges across a set of SME archetypes differing in size, complexity, and use of IT. Simple combinations of controls are matched to archetypes, balancing capabilities to protect data assets with the effort demands placed upon employees. Experiments indicate that two-factor authentication can be readily adopted by many SMEs and their employees to protect core assets, followed by correct access privileges and anti-malware software. Service and technology providers emerge as playing an important role in improving access to usable security controls for SMEs.},

Recent research has focused on interventions for children’s mealtime behaviors which can lead to distraction and neglect of food literacy learning. We propose FeastyMaze, a tangible and multi-sensory interactive puzzle game for young children to improve eating behavior. With the Five-color Diet Theory, our approach enables children to actively learn about food nutrition and balanced diets. To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of FeastyMaze, we conducted a user study with preschoolers (N = 12) who exhibited picky eating behaviors. The results showed that it effectively increased children’s familiarity and understanding of food knowledge, built positive attitudes towards previously disliked foods, and had the potential to improve their eating behavior.},

The efforts to regulate hateful speech on college campuses pose vexing socio-political problems, and the interventions to mitigate the effects require evaluating the pervasiveness of the phenomenon on campuses as well the impacts on students' psychological state. Data and Methods. Given the growing use of social media among college students, we target the above issues by studying the online aspect of hateful speech in a dataset of 6 million Reddit comments shared in 174 college communities. To quantify the prevelence of hateful speech in an online college community, we devise College Hate Index (CHX). Next, we examine its distribution across the categories of hateful speech,behavior, class, disability, ethnicity, gender, physical appearance, race, religion, andsexual orientation. We then employ a causal-inference framework to study the psychological effects of hateful speech, particularly in the form of individuals' online stress expression. Finally, we characterize their psychological endurance to hateful speech by analyzing their language -- their discriminatory keyword use, and their personality traits. Results. We find that hateful speech is prevalent in college subreddits, and 25% of them show greater hateful speech than non-college subreddits. We also find that the exposure to hate leads to greater stress expression. However, everybody exposed is not equally affected; some show lower psychological endurance than others. Low endurance individuals are more vulnerable to emotional outbursts, and are more neurotic than those with higher endurance.  Discussion. Our work bears implications for policy-making and intervention efforts to tackle the damaging effects of online hateful speech in colleges. From technological perspective, our work caters to mental health support provisions on college campuses, and to moderation efforts in online college communities. In addition, given the charged aspect of speech dilemma, we highlight the ethical implications of our work. Our work lays the foundation for studying the psychological impacts of hateful speech in online communities in general, and situated communities in particular (the ones that have both an offline and an online analog).},

This study evaluates such services' potential to provide healthy-food access and influence healthy-food purchases among individuals living in transportation-scarce and low-resource areas. We conducted a pilot experiment with 20 participants consisting of a randomly assigned group's 1-month use of an online grocery delivery service, and a control group's 1-month collection of grocery receipts, and a set of semi-structured interviews. We found that online grocery delivery services (a) serve as a feasible model to healthy-food access if they are affordable and amenable to multiple payment forms and (b) could lead to healthier selections. We contribute policy recommendations to bolster affordability of healthy-food access and design opportunities to promote healthy foods to support the adoption and use of these services among low-resource and transportation-scarce groups.},

abstract = {Cross-reality technologies are quickly establishing themselves as commonplace platforms for presenting objects of historical, scientific, artistic, and cultural interest to the public. In this space, augmented reality (AR) is notably successful in delivering cultural heritage applications, including architectural and environmental heritage reconstruction, exhibition data management and representation, storytelling, and exhibition curation. Generally, it has been observed that the nature of information delivery in applications created for narrating exhibitions tends to be informative and formal. Here we report on the assessment of a pilot scene for a prototype AR application that attempts to break this mold by employing a humorous and playful mode of communication. This bespoke AR experience harnessed the cutting-edge live-action capture technique of volumetric video to create a digital tour guide that playfully embellished the museological experience of the museum visitors. This applied research article consists of measuring, presenting, and discussing the appeal, interest, and ease of use of this ludic AR storytelling strategy mediated via AR technology in a cultural heritage context.},

abstract = {In this perspective paper we study the effect of non independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data on federated online learning to rank (FOLTR) and chart directions for future work in this new and largely unexplored research area of Information Retrieval. In the FOLTR process, clients participate in a federation to jointly create an effective ranker from the implicit click signal originating in each client, without the need to share data (documents, queries, clicks). A well-known factor that affects the performance of federated learning systems, and that poses serious challenges to these approaches, is that there may be some type of bias in the way data is distributed across clients. While FOLTR systems are on their own rights a type of federated learning system, the presence and effect of non-IID data in FOLTR has not been studied. To this aim, we first enumerate possible data distribution settings that may showcase data bias across clients and thus give rise to the non-IID problem. Then, we study the impact of each setting on the performance of the current state-of-the-art FOLTR approach, the Federated Pairwise Differentiable Gradient Descent (FPDGD), and we highlight which data distributions may pose a problem for FOLTR methods. We also explore how common approaches proposed in the federated learning literature address non-IID issues in FOLTR. This allows us to unveil new research gaps that, we argue, future research in FOLTR should consider.},

Rural communities often lack technical infrastructures, awareness about available services and the necessary skills to use them to their full potential. In this paper, we present a collaborative web-site development project initiated by a rural San community in Namibia. The website intends to support a current community livelihood activity of setting up a campground next to their village. Embedded in a community-based research approach we have deployed co-design methods and techniques to establish a consensus-based business description, including target market, activities, pricing and promotion strategies. Co-design techniques enabled the community to examine and refine their conceptualisation of their business endeavour as well as anticipate target audiences and operational scenarios. A basic website has been created including the agreed upon content. Further efforts include a wider dissemination of the information as well as possible inclusion in global broker websites. We conclude with a reflection on the co-design process providing a researcher and a community perspective.},

This work presents a literature review on this form of innovation - technologies that bridge the paper-digital gap. First, we synthesize an understanding of paper and its relationship with digital devices through the lens of past works. Then, we outline the state-of-the-art for paper-digital interfaces and highlight possible use cases and implementation approaches. Last, we discuss design considerations and future work for developing paper-digital interfaces.

In Hungary, digitising public services is challenging, but the country has made significant progress in several areas in recent years. In this study, we investigated the usage patterns of e-administration services in Hungary, focusing on the relationship between age and usage patterns for web-based platforms and mobile applications and the relationship between usage patterns and opinions on the importance of e-administration. Our results confirm the general hypothesis that younger age groups prefer to use digital tools, including e-administration services. Still, the relationship between age and willingness to use is weaker than expected for app usage. In Hungary, attitudes towards the importance of e-administration systems and actual usage of e-administration services are not closely related. Most citizens consider e-administration highly important, but in practice, the usage rate cannot be regarded as high. The research was not based on representative data provision and should be interpreted as a pilot study.},

Further, we wished to consider how future digital platforms might capture important elements of the volunteer experience to better support recruitment, retention and recognition. We present our findings and discuss digital platform implications around the four implicit 'promises' of volunteering: the social promise, the opportunity promise, the value promise and the organisational citizenship promise.

abstract = {Despite the potential of online spaces for the democratic development of public discourse, concerns over aggressive and uncivil interactions in those spaces are rising. Online incivility is the term to define the features of a discussion that convey an unnecessarily disrespectful tone toward the participants or the topic. Concerning the adverse impact of online incivility on users, we sought to explore ways to reduce online incivility to promote secure and trustworthy online debate culture. Meanwhile, the web is becoming increasingly multimodal and images are known to be an effective way of improving emotions. The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that positive emotions generated by positive images can impact incivility levels. Hence, with the goal to reduce online incivility, we conducted a one factorial between-subject online experiment with three conditions (N = 105). We compared the three conditions (with a positive background image in color, a positive background image in grayscale, and no background image) to identify an efficient way of reducing online incivility. The data gathered from surveys and participants' online comments were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to answer the research questions. The results showed that not only positive backgrounds in color but also positive backgrounds in grayscale may be effective in reducing online incivility. The results will pave way for designing more civil discussion platforms in online settings.},

By qualitatively analyzing six months of interaction among 588 group members and collecting the experiences of the group moderators, we inform about how the support groups acted as an important source for compensating the gaps in the existing healthcare, providing reassurance support on routine health, explanation on test reports, validation and counseling support in ongoing treatments. We also derive implications for the future of digital support groups and the need for further research on the use of unplatformed design models in resource-constrained settings.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication have connected devices, enabling major advances in various fields. The priority now is secure and efficient management of these interconnected systems. IoT ecosystems need access control to manage interactions. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), and Context-Based Access Control (CBAC)&nbsp;are examined in the context of Industrial IoT (IIoT) in this paper. Intelligent manufacturing and anticipatory maintenance are among the many opportunities created by IoT and IIoT rapid growth. However, these advances present new security and access control challenges. Access control is essential for managing user, device, and application authorization in complex, interconnected environments. Our goal is to analyze their suitability, pros, and cons in industrial settings where strict access control is needed to ensure system safety, confidentiality, and efficiency. The IIoT case study implementation of these access control mechanisms is the focus of this paper. We examine an IIoT scenario in which a manufacturing plant has a network of machinery, sensors, and control systems. The case study shows how RBAC, ABAC, PBAC, and CBAC apply pragmatically. We evaluate their ability to manage access to critical machinery, data, and devices. We analyze and compare these access control mechanisms within the IIoT framework to determine the best one for the industrial environment, taking into account scalability, security, real-time decision making, and industrial process complexity. This paper examines access control mechanisms and practical observations from a real-world IIoT case study to improve IIoT security discussions. The findings can help IIoT practitioners, researchers, and decision-makers choose access control solutions. Industrial operations can become safer and more efficient.},

abstract = {This paper reports on research-driven design of social technologies. It describes an exploratory field study evaluating and re-conceiving blogging technologies - a mobile phone, a mobile blog, a Weblog and synchronization software - to support personal change, in this case quitting smoking. We briefly describe the design of the blogging technologies and summarise the outcomes of their extended use by four people trying to quit smoking in terms of technology usage, domestication and acceptance and, smoking cessation. We then document some notable features of failure, both of the technology and the quit attempts, describing how understanding the nuances and subtleties of failure highlights important design considerations. Finally, we present some methodological and design recommendations emerging from: a design workshop involving the participants in the field study; and a desktop design exercise.},

abstract = {A serious issue in today’s society is Depression, which can have a devastating impact on a person’s ability to cope in daily life. Numerous studies have examined the use of data generated directly from users using social media to diagnose and detect Depression as a mental illness. Therefore, this paper investigates the language used in individuals’ personal expressions to identify depressive symptoms via social media. Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are used in this study as a solution to the problems associated with text classification of depression. These GATs can be constructed using masked self-attention layers. Rather than requiring expensive matrix operations such as similarity or knowledge of network architecture, this study implicitly assigns weights to each node in a neighbourhood. This is possible because nodes and words can carry properties and sentiments of their neighbours. Another aspect of the study that contributed to the expansion of the emotion lexicon was the use of hypernyms. As a result, our method performs better when applied to data from the Reddit subreddit Depression. Our experiments show that the emotion lexicon constructed by using the Graph Attention Network ROC achieves 0.91 while remaining simple and interpretable.},

For example, how do we judge whether one kind of structure supports evolution better than another kind of structure without comparing them in a fairly controlled way? In this paper we claim that certain aspects of software evolution should be evaluated in controlled experiments with first students, and then professionals, as subjects. Although we may have to compromise on longevity (due to enormous costs), we may observe cause-effect relationships in experiments that cannot be identified in case studies. We describe various challenges of conducting such experiments. We illustrate these issues by a controlled experiment on changeability decay conducted with students and a planned, more realistic extension with mostly software professionals as subjects.},

Yet, very few of them have been deployed at a large scale or had their use studied at a mature level of implementation. In this study, we surveyed 366 distance learning university teachers across four faculties three years after PLA has been made available across university as business as usual. Informed by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), we present a context-specific version of UTAUT that reflects teachers’ perceptions of PLA in distance learning higher education. The adoption and use of PLA was shown to be positively influenced by less experience in teaching, performance expectancy, self-efficacy, positive attitudes, and low anxiety, while negatively influenced by a lack of facilitating conditions and low effort expectancy, indicating that the type of technology and context within which it is used are significant factors determining our understanding of technology usage and adoption. This study provides significant insights as to how to design, apply and implement PLA with teachers in higher education.},

Existing technology support, including tracking technology, largely targets pregnant people and ignores other stakeholders. We therefore lack an understanding of how to approach designing collaborative pregnancy tracking technology. To understand how people collaborate around pregnancy tracking and wish to do so, we interviewed 13 pregnant people and 11 non-pregnant stakeholders in the U.S., including partners, friends, and grandparents-to-be. We find that people collaborate for goals like social bonding and jointly managing various pregnancy data. Stakeholders collaborated by either dividing up data types or collectively monitoring the same information. We also identify tensions and challenges, such as pregnant people’s privacy concerns and stakeholders’ varied levels of interest in tracking. In light of socio-cultural norms and stakeholders’ distinctive roles around pregnancy, we point to opportunities for designing collaborative technology that aligns with as well as challenges socio-cultural practices around pregnancy tracking.},

abstract = {In recent years, remote collaboration has become increasingly common both in the workplace and in the classroom. It is imperative that we understand and support remote collaborative problem solving, particularly understanding the experiences of people from historically marginalized groups whose intellectual contributions are essential for addressing the pressing needs society faces. This paper reports on a study in which 58 introductory computer science students constructed code remotely with a partner following either predefined structured roles (driver and navigator in pair programming) or without predefined structured roles. Between the structured-role and unstructured-role conditions, participants? normalized learning gain, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores, and system usability scores were not significantly different. However, regardless of the collaboration condition, women reported significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of perceived competence, and less perceived choice compared to men. Because computer science is a context in which women have been historically marginalized, we next examined the relationship between student gender and collaborative dialogues by extracting lexical and sentiment features from the textual messages partners exchanged. Results reveal that dialogue features, such as number of utterances, utterance length, and partner sentiment, significantly correlated with women's reports of stress, perceived competence, or perceived choice. These findings provide insight on women's experiences in remote programming, suggest that dialogue features can predict their collaborative experiences, and hold implications for designing systems that help provide collaborative experiences in which everyone can thrive.},

abstract = {To promote calm breathing inside a car, we designed a just-in-time breathing intervention stimulated by multi-sensory feedback and evaluated its efficacy in a driving simulator. Efficacy was measured via reduction in breathing rate as well as by user acceptance and driving safety measures. Drivers were first exposed to demonstrations of three kinds of ambient feedback designed to stimulate a goal breathing rate: (1) auditory (rhythmic background noise), (2) synchronized modulation of wind (dashboard fans modulating air pointed toward the driver) together with auditory, or (3) synchronized visual (ambient lights) together with auditory. After choosing one preference from these three, each driver engaged in a challenging driving task in a car simulator, where the ambient stimulation was triggered when their breathing exceeded a goal rate adapted to their personal baseline. Two user studies were conducted in a car simulator involving respectively 23 and 31 participants. The studies include both manual and autonomous driving scenarios to evaluate drivers' engagement in the intervention under different cognitive loads. The most frequently selected stimulation was the combined auditory and wind modalities. Measures of changes in breathing rate show that the participants were able to successfully engage in the breathing intervention; however, several factors from the driving context appear to have an impact on when the intervention is or is not effective.},

With an older growing population, previous works have explored assistive technologies (ATs) to automate repetitive components of therapy and thereby increase patients' autonomy and reduce dependence on carers. While most ATs were built around screens and projection-based augmented reality (AR), the potential of head-mounted displays (HMDs) for therapeutic assistance is still under-explored. As a contribution to this effort we present cARe, an HMD-based AR framework that uses in-situ instructions and a guidance mechanism to assist patients with manual tasks. In a case study with six geriatric patients, we investigated the prototype's feasibility during a cooking task in comparison to a regular paper-based recipe. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate that cARe has potential to offer assistance to older individuals with declining cognitive function in their day-to-day tasks and increase their independence in an enjoyable way.},

This study focuses on algorithmic crime mapping, a prevalent yet underexplored form of algorithmic decision support (ADS) in this context. We conducted experiments and follow-up interviews with 60 participants, including community members, technical experts, and law enforcement agents (LEAs), to explore how lived experiences, technical knowledge, and domain expertise shape interactions with the ADS, impacting human-AI decision-making. Surprisingly, we found that domain experts (LEAs) often exhibited anchoring bias, readily accepting and engaging with the first crime map presented to them. Conversely, community members and technical experts were more inclined to engage with the tool, adjust controls, and generate different maps. Our findings highlight that all three stakeholders were able to provide critical feedback regarding AI design and use - community members questioned the core motivation of the tool, technical experts drew attention to the elastic nature of data science practice, and LEAs suggested redesign pathways such that the tool could complement their domain expertise.},

abstract = {Despite the central role that stories play in social movement-building, they are difficult to sustainably document for many reasons. To explore this challenge, this paper describes the design of a community-based conversational storytelling agent (CSA) to document digital stories of housing insecurity. Building on insights from an ongoing grassroots project, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, we share how a study initially focused on CSA-support opened an investigation of the role that artificial intelligence may play in housing justice movements. Drawing from 17 interviews with narrators of housing insecurity experiences and collectors of such stories, we find that collectors perceive opportunities to expand means of documentation with multimedia and multi-language support. Meanwhile, some narrators perceive potential for a CSA to offer therapeutic storytelling experiences and document otherwise unrecorded stories. Yet, CSA encounters also surface perils of machine bias, as well as reduced possibilities of human connections and relations.},

abstract = {Physical computing has gained popularity as a hands-on approach to introduce computing. Young students can create tangible computing artifacts that connect across the curriculum subjects on a wide range of kid-friendly devices. However, physical computing can place a higher demand on cognitive capacity than traditional screen-based environments since learning involves the more complex tasks of programming and constructing hardware components and circuits. In this paper, we present an instructional design approach to address the challenges of teaching physical computing for middle school students. A hands-on project is modularized into tasks that isolate the software or hardware workloads. The tasks are then optimized into a sequence to minimize context switches between programming and hardware construction. Students' individual progress over a task sequence is monitored by group and peer checkpoints. We conducted a preliminary study among three random groups of grade 5-7 students working on activities of different levels of hardware complexity. The results indicate that our modular approach help students maintain a positive attitude and persist over difficulties while learning complex physical computing tasks.},

In a field study, we evaluated a monocular, opaque HWD for multi-patient monitoring, which supervising anesthesiologists wore for 8-10 days each. We investigated the effect of prolonged HWD use on the experience of the supervising anesthesiologists and their co-workers using interviews and repeated observations. A reflexive thematic analysis showed (1) interaction and mindset changes over time, (2) information on the HWD is more than numbers, (3) the HWD affects co-workers' collaboration with supervisors, and (4) distraction depends on the point of view. Using activity theory, we discuss the fact that HWD use develops and changes over time and that even a single-user HWD influences the collaboration with co-workers. We conclude with implications for HWD design, implementation, and evaluation.},

abstract = {Welcome to ITiCSE 2015 in Vilnius!The ITiCSE conference celebrates its 20th anniversary in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania and the geographical center of Europe, so declared in 1989 by scientists of the French National Institute of Geography.ITiCSE will be held on July 6--8, starting on Lithuania's Statehood Day (July 6). This is an annual public holiday that commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. The conference venue is the Parliament buildings (Seimas) of the Republic of Lithuania, and the conference dinner is to served in the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, one of the most famous in Europe in the 15--17th centuries. ITiCSE 2015 is hosted by Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most famous establishments of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe, founded in 1579. The conference organizers represent the Lithuanian research group of Informatics and Informatics Engineering Didactics at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University.This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, papers, panels, posters, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups and exhibitions.The conference continues to be truly international with a total of 170 submissions from 40 countries on six continents, with authors from Africa (4), Asia (50), Europe (151), North America (119), Oceania (51), and South America (17). These submissions consisted of 124 research papers, 1 panel, 9 working group proposals, and 36 proposals for posters or for tips, techniques &amp; courseware.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least four reviewers, though most papers received five or six reviews. A meta-review was conducted by the members of the conference committee to ensure the reliability of the reviews and to make recommendations to the chairs. A final selection phase was conducted by the program chairs who reviewed all reviews and meta-review recommendations before making their final decisions. As a result of this process, 54 research papers (43.5%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The authors of the accepted papers come from 17 different countries on five continents.All poster submissions were blind reviewed by two members of the conference committee, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware submissions were blind reviewed by three members of the conference committee. Submissions in these categories were then reviewed by the conference chair before selection by the program chairs for final inclusion in the conference. Twenty-four were accepted, representing authors from 15 countries.The two keynote speakers address the learning of programming and computational thinking. Professor Mordechai (Moti) Ben-Ari from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, will give a talk titled In Defense of Programming, which defends the (perhaps controversial) position that programming is the fundamental activity of CS. In the other keynote talk Professor Maciej M. Syslo from Nicolaus Copernicus University and University of Wroc\l{}aw, Poland, will address algorithmic nand computational thinking as the way to computing for all students.ITiCSE is famous for its working groups. Participating in a working group provides a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group. It is also one of the best ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. Seven working groups have been accepted over a broad spectrum of topics. The working groups range from general topics, such as computing education terminology, CS education in K-9 and K-12 schools, and designing an IT curriculum framework for graduates in 2025, to more specific topics such as developing a repository for high school CS questions, visual assessment tools and metadata annotations, and how students construct solutions to programming problems. The leaders of the accepted working groups come from over 13 countries.Welcome to Vilnius and enjoy the vicennial ITiCSE conference and Lithuania's Statehood Day!},

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-mediated communication (AIMC), tools powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to interpersonal communication. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we conducted a one-week diary and interview study to explore users’ perceptions of these tools’ ability to: 1) support interpersonal communication in the short-term, and 2) lead to potential long-term effects. Our findings indicate that participants view AIMC support favorably, citing benefits such as increased communication confidence, finding precise language to express their thoughts, and navigating linguistic and cultural barriers. However, our findings also show current limitations of AIMC tools, including verbosity, unnatural responses, and excessive emotional intensity. These shortcomings are further exacerbated by user concerns about inauthenticity and potential overreliance on the technology. We identify four key communication spaces delineated by communication stakes (high or low) and relationship dynamics (formal or informal) that differentially predict users’ attitudes toward AIMC tools. Specifically, participants report that these tools are more suitable for communicating in formal relationships than informal ones and more beneficial in high-stakes than low-stakes communication.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs) are characterized by the collective effort of heterogenous nodes called sensors and actors. Sensor nodes collect information about the physical world, while actor nodes take action decisions and perform appropriate actions upon the environment. The collaborative operation of sensors and actors brings significant advantages over traditional sensing, including improved accuracy, larger coverage area and timely actions upon the sensed phenomena. However, to realize these potential gains, there is a need for an efficient transport layer protocol that can address the unique communication challenges introduced by the coexistence of sensors and actors. In this paper, a Real-Time and Reliable Transport (RT)2 protocol is presented for WSANs. The objective of the (RT)2 protocol is to reliably and collaboratively transport event features from the sensor field to the actor nodes with minimum energy dissipation and to timely react to sensor information with a right action. In this respect, the (RT)2 protocol simultaneously addresses congestion control and timely event transport reliability objectives in WSANs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort focusing on real-time and reliable transport protocol for WSANs. Performance evaluations via simulation experiments show that the (RT)2 protocol achieves high performance in terms of reliable event detection, communication latency and energy consumption in WSANs.},

abstract = {Mobile ad hoc networks are a promising technology enabling the spontaneous formation of communication networks without dedicated infrastructure. However, ad hoc networks are not yet ready for large-scale deployment, because several unsolved research challenges persist. Evaluation methods such as analytical modeling, simulation, emulation, and real-world experiments aid in addressing these challenges. Applying a single method alone often leaves doubt as to the accuracy of the obtained results. Thus, there is a strong need for tools that support the task of modeling, evaluation, and analysis. These tools should allow for protocol validation, performance analysis, and proof-of-concept implementation using multiple evaluation methods. In this paper, we present a new approach for conducting simulation, emulation, and real-world experiments in mobile ad hoc networks using a single tool that allows for vertical validation of experiments. We explain the principles behind the architecture of our tool and systematically assess its limitations.},

We identified (1) how researchers understood the social justice-relevant harms and benefits, (2) the approaches researchers used to address harm, and (3) the tools that researchers leveraged to pursue justice. Our analysis highlights gaps in social justice work, such as the need for our community to conceptualize benefits, and identifies concrete steps the HCI community can take to pursue just futures.

We introduce PMCR framework, as a way to focus on needs for Prevention, Monitoring, Crisis and Recovery. We focused on Crisis and Recovery, and designed a tool to satisfy a target’s needs related to documenting evidence of harassment during the crisis and creating reports that could be shared with support networks for recovery. Finally, we discuss users’ feedback to this tool, highlighting needs for targets as they face the burden and offer recommendations to future designers and scholars on how to develop tools that can help targets manage their harassment.},

It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

abstract = {Recognizing others is a major challenge for people with visual impairments (VIPs) and can hinder engagement in social activities. We present Accessibility Bot, a research prototype bot on Facebook Messenger, that leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and a user's friends' tagged photos on Facebook to help people with visual impairments recognize their friends. Accessibility Bot provides users information about identity and facial expressions and attributes of friends captured by their phone's camera. To guide our design, we interviewed eight VIPs to understand their challenges and needs in social activities. After designing and implementing the bot, we conducted a diary study with six VIPs to study its use in everyday life. While most participants found the Bot helpful, their experience was undermined by perceived low recognition accuracy, difficulty aiming a camera, and lack of knowledge about the phone's status. We discuss these real-world challenges, identify suitable use cases for Accessibility Bot, and distill design implications for future face recognition applications.},

abstract = {The popularity of racket sports (e.g., tennis and table tennis) leads to high demands for data analysis, such as notational analysis, on player performance. While sports videos offer many benefits for such analysis, retrieving accurate information from sports videos could be challenging. In this paper, we propose EventAnchor, a data analysis framework to facilitate interactive annotation of racket sports video with the support of computer vision algorithms. Our approach uses machine learning models in computer vision to help users acquire essential events from videos (e.g., serve, the ball bouncing on the court) and offers users a set of interactive tools for data annotation. An evaluation study on a table tennis annotation system built on this framework shows significant improvement of user performances in simple annotation tasks on objects of interest and complex annotation tasks requiring domain knowledge.},

abstract = {Context: Empirical studies are gaining recognition in the Software Engineering (SE) research community, allowing improved quality of research and accelerating the adoption of new technologies in the software market. However, empirical studies in this area are still limited. In order to foster empirical research in SE, it is essential to understand the resources available to aid these studies. Goal: Identify support mechanisms (methodology, tool, guideline, process, etc.) used to conduct empirical studies in the Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) community. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study that included all full papers published at EASE, ESEM and ESEJ since their first editions. Were selected 891 studies between 1996 and 2013. Results: A total of 375 support mechanisms were identified. We provide the full list of mechanisms and the strategies that uses them. Despite this, we identified a high number of studies that do not cite any mechanism to support their empirical strategies: 433 studies (48%). Experiment is the strategy that has more resources to support their activities. And guideline was the most used type of mechanism. Moreover we observed that the most mechanisms used as reference to empirical studies are not specific to SE area. And some mechanisms were used only in specific activities of empirical research, such as statistical and qualitative data analysis. Experiment and case studies are the strategies most applied. Conclusions: The use of empirical methods in SE has increased over the years. Despite this, many studies did not apply these methods and do not cite any resource to guide their research. Therefore, the list of support mechanisms, where and how they were applied is a major asset to the SE community. Such asset can encourage empirical studies aiding the choice regarding which strategies and mechanisms to use in a research, as well as pointing out examples where they were used, mainly to novice researchers. We also identified new perspectives and gaps that foster other research for the improvement of empirical research in this area.},

Despite the positive growth story, businesses had pointed to challenges in obtaining business licenses. The prevalence of physical touchpoints, lack of systematic coordination between agencies, absence of robust legislation, information asymmetry on procedures, lack of enforceable timelines, and effective aftercare mechanisms, stymied the State from realizing the true economic potential. To enhance the business climate in the State, a series of reforms built around the digitization of the G2B interface through the ‘Tamil Nadu Single Window Portal’ was initiated in 2017-18. This short paper attempts to delineate factors that enabled the successful implementation of this dedicated G2B platform, and highlights the reform process, initiatives, impact on businesses / economy and transferable learnings from this transformation journey.},

abstract = {Mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to be effective in improving mental health, and technology-based methods have the potential to expand the accessibility of these therapies. To enable real-time personalized content generation for mindfulness practice in these methods, high-quality computer-synthesized text-to-speech (TTS) voices are needed to provide verbal guidance and respond to user performance and preferences. However, the user-perceived quality of state-of-the-art TTS voices has not yet been evaluated for administering mindfulness meditation, which requires emotional expressiveness. In addition, work has not yet been done to study the effect of physical embodiment and personalization on the user-perceived quality of TTS voices for mindfulness. To that end, we designed a two-phase human subject study. In Phase 1, an online Mechanical Turk between-subject study (N=471) evaluated 3 (feminine, masculine, child-like) state-of-the-art TTS voices with 2 (feminine, masculine) human therapists' voices in 3 different physical embodiment settings (no agent, conversational agent, socially assistive robot) with remote participants. Building on findings from Phase 1, in Phase 2, an in-person within-subject study (N=94), we used a novel framework we developed for personalizing TTS voices based on user preferences, and evaluated user-perceived quality compared to best-rated non-personalized voices from Phase 1. We found that the best-rated human voice was perceived better than all TTS voices; the emotional expressiveness and naturalness of TTS voices were poorly rated, while users were satisfied with the clarity of TTS voices. Surprisingly, by allowing users to fine-tune TTS voice features, the user-personalized TTS voices could perform almost as well as human voices, suggesting user personalization could be a simple and very effective tool to improve user-perceived quality of TTS voice.},

We don't do this simply to shed light but to influence change. We stand when others are forced to sit and speak when others are silenced. For many of us, the past several years have rendered our usual tools ineffective, and often we find ourselves seated, scared to stand, and essentially silenced as we search for new language to describe old problems. We increasingly, and rightfully, feel frustrate... powerles... angry. Unfortunately, we sometimes allow these feelings to lead us to inaction. However, as the Black feminist scholar Audre Lorde wrote in her masterpiece, Sister Outsider, anger, directed in productive ways, can be transformative.},

abstract = {The promise of recommender systems is to provide intelligent support to developers during their programming tasks. Such support ranges from suggesting program entities to taking into account pertinent Q&amp;A pages. However, current recommender systems limit the context analysis to change history and developers' activities in the IDE, without considering what a developer has already consulted or perused, e.g., by performing searches from the Web browser. Given the faceted nature of many programming tasks, and the incompleteness of the information provided by a single artifact, several heterogeneous resources are required to obtain the broader picture needed by a developer to accomplish a task.We present Libra, a holistic recommender system. It supports the process of searching and navigating the information needed by constructing a holistic meta-information model of the resources perused by a developer, analyzing their semantic relationships, and augmenting the web browser with a dedicated interactive navigation chart. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Libra provides evidence that a holistic analysis of a developer's information context can indeed offer comprehensive and contextualized support to information navigation and retrieval during software development.},

We propose a new method for crowd-based ideation that simplifies the process by having smaller crowds join in-person ideators during synchronous creative sessions. Our system Crowdboard allows online crowds to provide real-time creative input during early-stage design activities, such as brainstorming or concept mapping. The system enables in-person ideators to develop ideas on a physical or digital whiteboard which is augmented with real-time creative input from online participants who see and hear a live broadcast of the meeting. We validate Crowdboard via two user studies in which dyads of in-person ideators brainstormed with the help of crowd ideators. Our studies suggest that Crowdboard can effectively enhance ongoing brainstorming sessions, but also revealed key challenges for how to better facilitate interactions among in-person and crowd ideators.},

abstract = {The main goal of an Advanced Traffic Management System is to help human road managers to improve traffic flows and road safety. This goal turns out to be especially hard due to the difficulties in getting continuous traffic information and also because this information is distributed in several equipments belonging to different traffic administrations and offices. So, if a traffic administration detects a traffic incident, the traffic administration must decide whom, when, what and how to perform the control actions to deal with this incident. Current approaches to answer these questions are completely human based. We propose that a Multiagent System (MAS) is able to almost-automatically carry out the answers to these questions. In this paper it is exposed the main features of this MAS (its ontology, agents and interaction protocols) and the behavior exhibited by this MAS when a meteorological incident is detected by a traffic administration in a real traffic scenario, the A3 Spanish freeway.},

abstract = {Winona State University in 1997 launched its laptop program, providing every student with a laptop computer to enhance his/her studies. Now, in 2009, laptop programs are no longer novelties; they are commonplace with more than 150 programs in higher education institutions across the country.[1] Winona State is a very different institution because of the program. The program has been woven into the fabric of the institution. Unlike at other institutions within the Minnesota State College and University (MnSCU) system, there are no traditional computer labs on the Winona campus. These specialized rooms for working with technology have given way to anytime, anywhere learning. Any room on campus can be turned into a learning space that provides students and faculty with the world's information resources at hand. Innovative pedagogies are in practice on campus with current action research projects looking at e-books and enhanced communications with students. Winona State's experiment with e-books is possible because of the universal laptop program.Winona State's new buildings on campus (i.e., science building, library, Maxwell renovation) were designed around a mobile computing environment. All the building spaces and equipment, including science labs, require that students have laptop computers. This mobile computing environment has allowed Winona State to create more efficient teaching and learning spaces even to connect high-tech science equipment. The design of the new Wellness Center also incorporates the realities of mobile computing.Since 1997, the program has become more than just a "laptop program." The name no longer describes its holistic impact on the academic programming of Winona State. With the blessing of the Winona State Student Association, the name of the laptop program was changed in January 2009 to the e-Warrior: Digital Life and Learning Program.After 10 years, Winona State is still gaining experience with its Digital Life and Learning Program. The program continues to evolve as more faculty and students familiarize themselves with the changing needs of students, and Winona State will continue to learn more about the role of the program's impact on its students' educational opportunities for years to come. As Winona State continues to evolve, the program at its core will always be about enhancing student success. This paper will focus on lessons learned over at Winona State University at its Digital Life and Learning Program.},

Crescendo supports students with Parsons problems to reduce problem complexity, Use-Modify-Create task progressions to gradually introduce new programming concepts, and automated feedback and assessment to support learning. In this work, we report on our experience deploying Crescendo in a programming camp for middle school students, as well as in an introductory university course for non-majors. Our initial results from field observations and log data suggest that the support features in Crescendo kept students engaged and allowed them to progress through programming concepts quickly. However, some students still struggled even with these highly-structured problems, requiring additional assistance, suggesting that even strong scaffolding may be insufficient to allow students to progress independently through the tasks.},

abstract = {For individuals with Social Anxiety (SA), interacting with others can be a challenging experience, a concern that extends into the virtual world. While technology has made significant strides in creating more realistic virtual human agents (VHA), the interplay of gaze and interpersonal distance when interacting with VHAs is often neglected. This paper investigates the effect of dynamic and static Gaze animations in VHAs on interpersonal distance and their relation to SA. A Bayesian analysis shows that static centered and dynamic centering gaze led participants to stand closer to VHAs than static averted and dynamic averting gaze, respectively. In the static gaze conditions, this pattern was found to be reversed in SA: participants with higher SA kept larger distances for static-centered gaze than for averted gaze VHAs. These findings update theory, elucidate how nuanced interactions with VHAs must be designed, and offer renewed guidelines for pleasant VHA interaction design.},

abstract = {Real-time simulation in augmented reality environments is an important area of research. The simulation model used in this paper simulates the musculoskeletal system, which has many potential applications in physiotherapy, medical education, and rehabilitation. To enable such real-time simulations in augmented reality, high-performance computing clusters are typically required, which can be costly and infeasible in terms of high network delay. This paper proposes SimEdge, a domain-specific edge computing system that enables real-time pervasive simulation in augmented reality environments on heterogeneous providers. This is done by smart offloading decisions based on a continuously updated list of resource providers. SimEdge builds on previous work using surrogate models and leverages scheduling improvements and context-aware data and task placement. Significant improvements in frame rate and input lag are achieved, as well as a reduction in energy consumption. The experimental results show that the proposed approach leads to an 8.3-fold increase in frame rate and a 65.14% reduction in input lag, as well as a 35.07% reduction in energy consumption compared to the local baseline system. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in improving efficiency and responsiveness.},

abstract = {Current desktop operating systems use CPU utilization (or lack thereof) to prioritize processes for scheduling. This was thought to be beneficial for interactive processes, under the assumption that they spend much of their time waiting for user input. This reasoning fails for modern multimedia applications. For example, playing a movie in parallel with a heavy background job usually leads to poor graphical results, as these jobs are indistinguishable in terms of CPU usage. Suggested solutions involve shifting the burden to the user or programmer, which we claim is unsatisfactory; instead, we seek an automatic solution. Our attempts using new metrics based on CPU usage failed. We therefore propose and implement a novel scheme of identifying interactive and multimedia applications by directly quantifying the I/O between an application and the user (keyboard, mouse, and screen activity). Preliminary results indicate that prioritizing processes according to this metric indeed solves the aforementioned problem, demonstrating that operating systems can indeed provide better support for multimedia and interactive applications. Additionally, once user I/O data is available, it opens intriguing new possibilities to system designers.},

abstract = {Model-driven engineering can be used to create problem-specific, conceptual models abstracting away unwanted details. Models at runtime take this principle to the time a system is running. Connecting and synchronizing multiple models creates several problems. Usually, models used at runtime must communicate with other systems over the network, they are often based on different paradigms, and in most settings a fast and reactive behaviour is required. We aim for a structured way to define and organize such connections in order to minimize development cost, network usage and computation effort while maximizing interoperability. In order to achieve those goals, we present an extension of the paradigm of models based on reference attribute grammars by creating a dedicated problem-specific language for those connections. We show how to connect several runtime models to a robotic system in order to control this robot and to provide guarantees for safe coexistence with nearby humans. We show, that using our approach, connections can be specified more concisely while maintaining the same efficiency as hand-written code.},

However, the challenges that university students face in technology-mediated LbT---whether it be teaching oneself, teaching a peer, or teaching an agent---are not well understood. Furthermore, there is a gap in knowledge on the challenges that students encounter throughout the process of teaching (content selection, preparation, teaching, receiving and giving feedback, and reflection) despite its importance to the design of LbT platforms. Thus, we conducted a study with 24 university students where they taught content they had not fully grasped, without guidance, and participated in a semi-structured interview. Results demonstrate that participants encountered the following challenges: psychological barriers relating to self and others, and lack of know-how. Furthermore, we illuminate design implications required to overcome these challenges and benefit from LbT without requiring prior training in pedagogy.},

The second solution is a distributed version for large sensor networks using a pricing scheme. It is capable of incremental adjustment when utility functions change.

abstract = {AI systems cannot exist without data. Now that AI models (data science and AI) have matured and are readily available to apply in practice, most organizations struggle with the data infrastructure to do so. There is a growing need for data engineers that know how to prepare data for AI systems or that can setup enterprise-wide data architectures for analytical projects. But until now, the data engineering part of AI engineering has not been getting much attention, in favor of discussing the modeling part. In this paper we aim to change this by perform a mapping study on data engineering for AI systems, i.e., AI data engineering. We found 25 relevant papers between January 2019 and June 2023, explaining AI data engineering activities. We identify which life cycle phases are covered, which technical solutions or architectures are proposed and which lessons learned are presented. We end by an overall discussion of the papers with implications for practitioners and researchers. This paper creates an overview of the body of knowledge on data engineering for AI. This overview is useful for practitioners to identify solutions and best practices as well as for researchers to identify gaps.},

abstract = {An increasing number of surgeons promote video review of laparoscopic surgeries for detection of technical errors at an early stage as well as for training purposes. The reason behind is the fact that laparoscopic surgeries require specific psychomotor skills, which are difficult to learn and teach. The manual inspection of surgery video recordings is extremely cumbersome and time-consuming. Hence, there is a strong demand for automated video content analysis methods. In this work, we focus on retrieving surgical actions from video collections of gynecologic surgeries. We propose two novel dynamic content descriptors for similarity search and investigate a query-by-example approach to evaluate the descriptors on a manually annotated dataset consisting of 18 hours of video content. We compare several content descriptors including dynamic information of the segments as well as descriptors containing only spatial information of keyframes of the segments. The evaluation shows that our proposed dynamic content descriptors considering motion and spatial information from the segment achieve a better retrieval performance than static content descriptors ignoring temporal information of the segment at all. The proposed content descriptors in this work enable content-based video search for similar laparoscopic actions, which can be used to assist surgeons in evaluating laparoscopic surgical skills.},

Based on these findings, we prototyped a suite of tools, called Erato that enables DHH speakers to be aware of their performance while speaking and remind participants of proper etiquette. We evaluated Erato by running a mock classroom case study over VC for three sessions. All participants felt more confident in their speaking ability and paid closer attention to making the classroom more inclusive while using our tool. We share implications of these results for the design of VC interfaces and human-the-the-loop assistive systems that can support users who are DHH to communicate effectively and advocate for their accessibility needs.},

abstract = {Despite growing implementation of teacher-facing analytics in higher education, relatively little is known about the detailed processes through which instructors make sense of analytics in their teaching practices beyond their initial encounters with tools. This study unpacked the sensemaking process of thirteen instructors with analytic experience, using interviews that included walkthroughs of their analytics use. Qualitative inductive analysis was used to identify themes related to (1) the questions they asked of the analytics, (2) the techniques they used to interpret them, and (3) the challenges they encountered. Findings indicated that instructors went beyond a general curiosity to develop three types of questions of the analytics (goal-oriented, problem-oriented, and instruction modification questions). Instructors also used specific techniques to read and explain data by (a) developing expectations about the answers the analytics would provide, and (b) making comparisons to reveal student diversity, identify effects of instructional revision and diagnose issues. The study found instructors faced an initial learning curve when seeking and making use of relevant information, but also continued to revisit these challenges when they were not able to develop a routine of analytics use. These findings both contribute to a conceptual understanding of instructor analytic sensemaking and have practical implications for its systematic support.},

abstract = {Metrics for human-robot teaming should extend to teams consisting of multiple human and robotic agents, and to teams working in complex, dynamic work domains. This work proposes that to comprehensively analyze and evaluate multi-human, multi-robot teams, traditional HRI metrics of performance, and efficiency must be expanded upon to incorporate metrics of teamwork. We develop five distinct metrics to capture both ecological and cognitive aspects of teamwork found to be important in human-automation interaction, inspired by research in the cognitive systems engineering (CSE) community. We demonstrate the application of these metrics in a spacecraft maintenance case study comparing multiple human-robot team architectures. The case study demonstrates that the teamwork metrics capture aspects of human-robot interaction (HRI) not apparent when using only traditional performance and efficiency metrics. The article concludes that the proposed teamwork metrics are complementary to existing metrics in HRI and should be included in the evaluation of human-robot teams.},

volume = {12},
abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media (such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets). This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people manage and analyze vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and capture semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to management and analysis of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.This book provides a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. Because humans can understand natural languages far better than computers can, effective involvement of humans in a text information system is generally needed and text information systems often serve as intelligent assistants for humans. Depending on how a text information system collaborates with humans, we distinguish two kinds of text information systems. The first is information retrieval systems which include search engines and recommender systems; they assist users in finding from a large collection of text data the most relevant text data that are actually needed for solving a specific application problem, thus effecively turning big raw text data into much smaller relevant text data that can be more easily processed by humans. The second is text mining application systems; they can assist users in analyzing patterns in text data to extract and discover useful actionable knowledge directly useful for task completion or decision making, thus providing more direct task support for users. This book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in information retrieval and text data mining from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of information retrieval and text mining to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. This book can be used as a textbook for computer science undergraduates and graduates, library and information scientists, or as a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in managing and analyzing text data.}
