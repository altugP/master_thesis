Lessons learned from the implementation of a Web-based nursing intervention,Bond GE.,Comput Inform Nurs. 2006 Mar-Apr;24(2):66-74. doi: 10.1097/00024665-200603000-00004.,Bond GE,Comput Inform Nurs,2006,2006/03/24,,,10.1097/00024665-200603000-00004,"The emergence of the World Wide Web in the last decade has introduced the belief that the Internet has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery and empower consumers. Given the power of technology to change the way we live, the healthcare community has begun to explore the feasibility of delivering interventions via the Web, including personalized care with chronic disease management. The purpose of this article is to describe this researcher's experience with the development and implementation of a Web-based intervention to enhance diabetes self-management for older adults. Challenges faced by the project involved inadequate funding to cover technology issues (programming, graphics design, etc),decisions regarding the appropriate environment/framework, and questions on how to merge the practice and theory of a given discipline with the limitations of Internet technology. This article will examine and discuss these issues and make recommendations on possible methods of improving the process."
Spirituality expressed by caregivers of stroke survivors,"Pierce LL, Steiner V, Havens H, Tormoehlen K.",West J Nurs Res. 2008 Aug;30(5):606-19. doi: 10.1177/0193945907310560. Epub 2008 Mar 21.,Pierce LL,West J Nurs Res,2008,2008/03/25,PMC2574562,NIHMS50487,10.1177/0193945907310560,"Thirty-six caregivers of stroke survivors who are new to that role participate in a Web-based support and education intervention over the course of a year. The authors use a secondary analysis of a total of 2,148 e-mail messages that these caregivers posted to the intervention's discussion group. Rigorous content analysis is used to analyze the narrative data coded to spirituality (n = 230 e-mails). Four themes emerge and are drawn to Friedemann's (1995) framework of systemic organization: (a) feeling the presence of a greater power, (b) practicing rituals, (c) being one with nature, and (d) interacting with family and friends. Spirituality gives these caregivers hope and sustenance, but it also helps them express themselves more fully during a difficult time of change. The e-mail discussion data presented here highlight the importance of increased awareness of addressing spirituality in nurse-client encounters and designing interventions to support the caregivers."
A framework for evaluating eHealth research,"Dansky KH, Thompson D, Sanner T.",Eval Program Plann. 2006 Nov;29(4):397-404. doi: 10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2006.08.009. Epub 2006 Oct 9.,Dansky KH,Eval Program Plann,2006,2007/10/24,,,10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2006.08.009,"Health care is in the midst of a consumer-oriented technology explosion. Individuals of all ages and backgrounds have discovered eHealth. But the challenges of implementing and evaluating eHealth are just beginning to surface, and, as technology changes, new challenges emerge. Evaluation is critical to the future of eHealth. This article addresses four dimensions of eHealth evaluation: (1) design and methodology issues; (2) challenges related to the technology itself; (3) environmental issues that are not specific to eHealth but pose special problems for eHealth researchers; and (4) logistic or administrative concerns of the evaluation methodology selected. We suggest that these four dimensions must be integrated to provide a holistic framework for designing and implementing eHealth research projects, as well as for understanding the totality of the eHealth intervention. The framework must be flexible enough to adapt to a variety of end users, regardless of whether the end user is a healthcare organization, a for-profit business, a community organization, or an individual. The framework is depicted as a puzzle with four interlocking pieces."
A conceptual framework for adaptive preventive interventions,"Collins LM, Murphy SA, Bierman KL.",Prev Sci. 2004 Sep;5(3):185-96. doi: 10.1023/b:prev.0000037641.26017.00.,Collins LM,Prev Sci,2004,2004/10/09,PMC3544191,NIHMS429205,10.1023/b:prev.0000037641.26017.00,"Recently, adaptive interventions have emerged as a new perspective on prevention and treatment. Adaptive interventions resemble clinical practice in that different dosages of certain prevention or treatment components are assigned to different individuals, and/or within individuals across time, with dosage varying in response to the intervention needs of individuals. To determine intervention need and thus assign dosage, adaptive interventions use prespecified decision rules based on each participant's values on key characteristics, called tailoring variables. In this paper, we offer a conceptual framework for adaptive interventions, discuss principles underlying the design and evaluation of such interventions, and review some areas where additional research is needed."
Facilitating Self-Management of Substance Use Disorders with Online Counseling: The Intervention and Study Design,"Haack MR, Alemi F, Nemes S, Harge A, Burda-Cohee C, Benson L.",J Addict Nurs. 2005;16(1-2):41-46. doi: 10.1080/10884600590917183.,Haack MR,J Addict Nurs,2005,2011/12/22,PMC3241973,NIHMS4357,10.1080/10884600590917183,"This paper describes a pilot study using online counseling for court-involved parents who have been charged with child abuse and neglect related to substance use. All families resided in the medically underserved area of Newark, New Jersey and were recruited from halfway houses and the Family Court. The sample consisted of 30 participants randomly assigned to control (n=15) and experimental (n=15) groups. Of the participants, 83% were Black, 13% were White, and 3% were Hispanic. The control group had access to usual face-to-face treatment at a local treatment center where typical court-ordered offenders were referred. Usual face-to-face treatment often involved being wait-listed for periods of months even for a detox bed. The experimental group had immediate access to the online counseling intervention. The online counseling software and the live counseling components of the intervention were developed with a stages of change theoretical framework. Preliminary findings show promise for the feasibility of online interventions for underserved populations."
