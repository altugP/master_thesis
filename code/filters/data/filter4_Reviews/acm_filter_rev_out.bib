 abstract = {While technology based health interventions can be effective, high attrition rates are commonly observed in research and practice and are a major issue in eHealth. Research on adherence has recently gained some scientific attention, but little has been done as to how technology itself engages users. It seems plausible that technology plays a role in persuading people to use an eHealth intervention and keep on using it. The present study seeks to apply the PSD-model with regard to this major issue in eHealth. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the databases Web of Knowledge, EBSCOHOST, Picarta, Scopus and ScienceDirect. The following characteristics were coded: Health care domain, Study level, Sample size, Intended usage, Usage web-based intervention, Adherence, Predictors of adherence, Intervention, Interaction, Persuasive technology in the intervention. The search yielded 4939 unique titles, of which 460 articles were deemed relevant. After title, abstract and full text screening by two researchers, 109 articles were included. Concluding, we can say that it seems that when designing web-based interventions, most attention is given to support the primary task. Dialogue support and social support appear neglected. Taking into account that more extensive use of persuasive technology seems to be positively related to adherence, more attention should be paid to all forms of support through technology.},

 abstract = {Diverse disciplines, including Human-Computer Interaction have explored how mobile health (mHealth) applications can transform healthcare and health promotion. Increasingly, research has explored how mHealth tools can promote healthy behaviors within vulnerable populations-groups that disproportionately experience barriers to wellness. We conducted a systematic review of 83 papers from diverse disciplines to characterize the design and impact of mHealth tools in low-socioeconomic (low-SES) and racial/ethnic minority individuals. Our findings highlight that the diversity within low-SES and racial/ethnic minority groups was not reflected in the populations studied. Most studies focused on improving the health of individuals, often neglecting factors at the community and society levels that influence health disparities. Moreover, few improvements in health outcomes were demonstrated. We further discuss factors that acted as barriers and facilitators of mHealth intervention adoption. Our findings highlight trends that can drive critically needed digital health innovations for vulnerable populations.},

 abstract = {This article is a systematic review of work in the computing education literature on plagiarism. The goal of the review is to summarize the main results found in the literature and highlight areas that need further work. Despite the the large body of work on plagiarism, no systematic reviews have been published so far.The reviewed papers were categorized and analyzed using a theoretical framework from the field of Fraud Deterrence named the Fraud Triangle. According to this framework, fraudulent behavior occurs when the person is under pressure, perceives the availability of an opportunity to commit fraud, and rationalizes the fraudulent behavior in a way that makes it seem not unethical to him or her.The review found the largest amount of the reviewed papers to discuss ways for reducing the opportunity to plagiarize, as well as tools for detecting plagiarism. However, there is a clear lack of empirical work evaluating the deterrent efficacy of these strategies and tools. The reviewed papers also included mentions of a wide range of rationalizations used by computing students when justifying plagiarism, the most important of which are rationalizations that stem from confusion about what constitutes plagiarism. Finally, work on the relationship between pressure in computing courses and plagiarism was found to be very scarce and incommensurate with the significant contribution of this factor to plagiarism.},

 abstract = {High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in AI, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning (ML) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.},

In this paper, we present a systematic review of the literature in order to see which family health topics have been researched extensively or not, and to identify hidden aspects and opportunities for family-centered health technology research. We had a final sample of 55 papers from diverse sources in this process. Our findings highlight characteristics of the studies, families, and health design. We also describe existing technological solutions and evaluation measures. Based on our findings, we discuss factors that were comprehensively studied and others that need further exploration in future research related to family-centered health technology.},

However, our understanding of design mechanisms that induce healthier behavior change through mobile devices is still limited. Using the BCT Taxonomy, and online user reviews as an indicator of experience satisfaction, we make a three-folded contribution to designing interactive systems for behavior change: (i) a systematic review of applications for physical activity and healthier eating habits, coding BCTs; (ii) sentiment analysis performed on 20492 review sentences of these apps; and (iii) design implications regarding the implementation features for each BCT cluster, considering the highest-scored features in terms of sentiment analysis. Positive expressions referred to the framing/reframing technique. Contrarily, negative expressions were mostly related to reward and threat. Findings from this study can be used to benchmark interactions between users and behavior change interfaces, and provide design insights to support positive user experiences.},

First, we synthesize an understanding of paper and its relationship with digital devices through the lens of past works. Then, we outline the state-of-the-art for paper-digital interfaces and highlight possible use cases and implementation approaches.

It is not surprising that many studies have been carried out to better understand migraine using statistical and machine learning techniques. Since such analysis needs both good-quality and sufficient data, it becomes important to investigate tools that allow to improve the data collection protocol. A data acquisition tailored for such a problem would allow us to better understand the most determinant triggers that precede a migratory crisis, especially because those vary significantly for each individual. In this work we designed and evaluated a protocol for data collection comprising an initial questionnaire and a diary of habits and events. Using a decision tree model, we found the main domains of migraine triggers in the studied group are stress, caffeine intake, sleep and effects of the environment. More importantly, we report the most important aspects and challenges when designing such a protocol so that to better engage users, as well as users' testimonials when using the tool.},

 abstract = {Despite the potential of mobile health (mHealth) apps to provide patients with an effective means to self-manage asthma, to date, little is known about the key design features and health outcomes brought by such apps. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review and examine the research evidence on health outcomes of mHealth apps that support patient self-management of asthma and the key design features to achieve these outcomes. Four databases were searched using the keywords against the eligibility criteria, yielding 446 studies with ten finally included. The thematic analysis identified five key features of the mHealth app – communication, assessment, planning, education and reminder – abbreviated as a CAPER model. Of the nine studies that measured asthma control, eight showed significant positive changes and one remained unchanged. Seven studies measured asthma-related quality of life, seeing three positive changes, three without change, and one only with positive changes in physical measurements but not in mental measurements. Three studies measured asthma medication use with two positive changes and one unchanged. Lung function was measured in two studies while exacerbation, asthma symptoms, asthma education and self-efficacy were measured in only one study and significant positive outcomes only be seen in asthma symptoms and education; the other three remained unchanged. It appears that most mHealth apps for self-management of asthma can improve asthma control, asthma-related quality of life and medication use. Further research is needed to gather sound evidence about the relationship between the key design features and patient outcomes.},

They are also used to improve health habits using behaviour change strategies. However, the trends, effectiveness, and design practices of these apps in terms of behaviour change are unclear yet. With a collaboration between researchers, domain experts, interactive systems developers and professionals, this paper aims to fill this gap by systematically investigating 70 mHealth apps using two popular behaviour change frameworks, namely App Behaviour Change Scale (ABACUS) and the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model. The study investigates the most common strategies and how these strategies were designed and implemented in the apps to achieve the targeted design objectives. Furthermore, the study evaluates apps' behaviour change potential using the behaviour Change Score (BCS), a measure we introduced to evaluate how the apps employ behaviour change strategies. The results show that 1) Journaling is the most common category of apps. 2) the most employed strategies are Self-monitoring, Customize and Personalize, and Reminders. And 3) there is a positive correlation between apps' ranks (based on ratings and installation) and the BCS score of most strategies. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for designing and developing mHealth apps and present opportunities for future work in this area.},

 abstract = {Public media and researchers in different areas have recently focused on perhaps unexpected problems that derive from an excessive and frequent use of technology, giving rise to a new kind of psychological “digital” wellbeing. Such a novel and pressing topic has fostered, both in the academia and in the industry, the emergence of a variety of digital self-control tools allowing users to self-regulate their technology use through interventions like timers and lock-out mechanisms. While these emerging technologies for behavior change hold great promise to support people’s digital wellbeing, we still have a limited understanding of their real effectiveness, as well as of how to best design and evaluate them. Aiming to guide future research in this important domain, this article presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current work on tools for digital self-control. We surface motivations, strategies, design choices, and challenges that characterize the design, development, and evaluation of digital self-control tools. Furthermore, we estimate their overall effect size on reducing (unwanted) technology use through a meta-analysis. By discussing our findings, we provide insights on how to (i) overcome a limited perspective that exclusively focuses on technology overuse and self-monitoring tools, (ii) evaluate digital self-control tools through long-term studies and standardized measures, and (iii) bring ethics in the digital wellbeing discourse and deal with the business model of contemporary tech companies.},

However, research has shown that it can be hard to align data-driven insights of engagement with observed and self-reported levels of engagement. Given the emergence and increasing application of learning analytics (LA) within K-12 education, further research is needed to understand how engagement is being conceptualized and measured within LA research. This scoping review identifies and synthesizes literature published between 2011-2022, focused on LA and student engagement in K-12 contexts, and indexed in five international databases. 27 articles and conference papers from 13 different countries were included for review. We found that most of the research was undertaken in middle school years within STEM subjects. The results show that there is a wide discrepancy in researchers’ understanding and operationalization of engagement and little evidence to suggest that LA improves learning outcomes and support. However, the potential to do so remains strong. Guidance is provided for future LA engagement research to better align with these goals.},

 abstract = {Earlier research has investigated how educational social robots can influence learner motivation and learning outcomes as motivators instead of learning materials. This paper presents a scoping literature review of this body of work, focusing on the educational strategies used, and describing the range of approaches used to influence motivation and learning through social robots, not as learning tools but as motivators. Nineteen advanced studies are identified and described according to the components of the ARCS model (a motivation model dominant in robotics research): Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction. We summarized the measures used for motivation in the studies and relate these measures to the four ARCS model components. Finally, we analyzed the studies from the perspectives of sample groups, study type, and domain or subject. Our analyses suggested that beyond focusing on persuasive (educational) strategies that educational social robots can use to keep learners’ attention, researchers should also focus on the satisfaction component of motivation. Furthermore, future studies should examine long-term interactions, apply more rigor in using validated questionnaires, and combine qualitative and quantitative methods to understand not only the effects of these different approaches but also the reasons behind them.},

 abstract = {Cognitive reappraisal (CR) is a critical emotion regulation skill that is strongly associated with mental well-being outcomes. While CR has been well theorized psychologically and many therapeutic approaches exist, CR remains one of the toughest skills to learn and develop. We explore the design space of using technologically-mediated CR supports through a dual approach. First, we draw on a content analysis of 30 therapeutic manuals combined with five clinician interviews to understand existing CR processes and challenges in therapeutic settings. Second, we compare the identified challenges with a scoping review of 42 HCI papers on technologically-mediated CR interventions. This allowed us to identify trends and gaps in a field where digital health innovations are critically needed; and suggest four design opportunities that warrant further exploration. Together, our work contributes theoretically-derived future research opportunities, and provides researchers with concrete guidance to explore these important design spaces.},

 abstract = {Given the renewed attention on politics, values, and ethics within our field and the wider cultural milieu, now is the time to take stock of social justice research in HCI. We surveyed 124 papers explicitly pursuing social justice between 2009 and 2022 to better reflect on the current state of justice-oriented work within our discipline. We identified (1) how researchers understood the social justice-relevant harms and benefits, (2) the approaches researchers used to address harm, and (3) the tools that researchers leveraged to pursue justice. Our analysis highlights gaps in social justice work, such as the need for our community to conceptualize benefits, and identifies concrete steps the HCI community can take to pursue just futures. By providing a comprehensive overview of and reflection on HCI’s current social justice landscape, we seek to help our research community strategize, collaborate, and collectively act toward justice.},

 abstract = {Reddit is one of the world's most prominent social media platforms, and also a valuable source of data for internet researchers. However, working with this kind of data also presents novel ethical complications for researchers, including issues around privacy, vulnerable populations, and unintended consequences. This paper describes an analysis of 134 papers that rely on Reddit data while also including some discussion of ethical implications and/or considerations by the researchers. Our analysis of these papers reveals common ethical issues and ethically motivated methodological decisions, as described by the researchers themselves, while also exposing some gaps for further ethical contemplation for researchers relying on Reddit data. Based on these findings, we close with a set of recommendations for ethically-informed methods and reflection for researchers working with social data.},

@article{10.1145/3636515,
 abstract = {We conducted a systematic literature review on automated grading and feedback tools for programming education. We analysed 121 research papers from 2017 to 2021 inclusive and categorised them based on skills assessed, approach, language paradigm, degree of automation, and evaluation techniques. Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages. Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions. However, these techniques’ feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution. Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability, or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness. Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed. In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools’ performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders. However, because the evaluation dataset is frequently unavailable, it is more difficult to reproduce results and compare tools to a collection of common assignments.},

 abstract = {Describing and analysing learner behaviour using sequential data and analysis is becoming more and more popular in Learning Analytics. Nevertheless, we found a variety of definitions of learning sequences, as well as choices regarding data aggregation and the methods implemented for analysis. Furthermore, sequences are used to study different educational settings and serve as a base for various interventions. In this literature review, the authors aim to generate an overview of these aspects to describe the current state of using sequence analysis in educational support and learning analytics. The 74 included articles were selected based on the criteria that they conduct empirical research on an educational environment using sequences of learning actions as the main focus of their analysis. The results enable us to highlight different learning tasks where sequences are analysed, identify data mapping strategies for different types of sequence actions, differentiate techniques based on purpose and scope, and identify educational interventions based on the outcomes of sequence analysis.},

 abstract = {While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on students’ learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation, motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating learning constructs. Such efforts will advance our understanding of the potential of LADs to enhance learning outcomes and provide valuable insights for educators and researchers alike.},
