 abstract = {The emergence of the World Wide Web in the last decade has introduced
the belief that the Internet has the potential to revolutionize health
care delivery and empower consumers. Given the power of technology to
change the way we live, the healthcare community has begun to explore
the feasibility of delivering interventions via the Web, including
personalized care with chronic disease management. The purpose of this
article is to describe this researcher's experience with the development
and implementation of a Web-based intervention to enhance diabetes
self-management for older adults. Challenges faced by the project
involved inadequate funding to cover technology issues (programming,
graphics design, etc), decisions regarding the appropriate
environment/framework, and questions on how to merge the practice and
theory of a given discipline with the limitations of Internet
technology. This article will examine and discuss these issues and make
recommendations on possible methods of improving the process.},
