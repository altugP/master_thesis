 abstract = {Welcome to ITiCSE 2015 in Vilnius!The ITiCSE conference celebrates its 20th anniversary in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania and the geographical center of Europe, so declared in 1989 by scientists of the French National Institute of Geography.ITiCSE will be held on July 6--8, starting on Lithuania's Statehood Day (July 6). This is an annual public holiday that commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. The conference venue is the Parliament buildings (Seimas) of the Republic of Lithuania, and the conference dinner is to served in the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, one of the most famous in Europe in the 15--17th centuries. ITiCSE 2015 is hosted by Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most famous establishments of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe, founded in 1579. The conference organizers represent the Lithuanian research group of Informatics and Informatics Engineering Didactics at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University.This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, papers, panels, posters, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups and exhibitions.The conference continues to be truly international with a total of 170 submissions from 40 countries on six continents, with authors from Africa (4), Asia (50), Europe (151), North America (119), Oceania (51), and South America (17). These submissions consisted of 124 research papers, 1 panel, 9 working group proposals, and 36 proposals for posters or for tips, techniques &amp; courseware.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least four reviewers, though most papers received five or six reviews. A meta-review was conducted by the members of the conference committee to ensure the reliability of the reviews and to make recommendations to the chairs. A final selection phase was conducted by the program chairs who reviewed all reviews and meta-review recommendations before making their final decisions. As a result of this process, 54 research papers (43.5%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The authors of the accepted papers come from 17 different countries on five continents.All poster submissions were blind reviewed by two members of the conference committee, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware submissions were blind reviewed by three members of the conference committee. Submissions in these categories were then reviewed by the conference chair before selection by the program chairs for final inclusion in the conference. Twenty-four were accepted, representing authors from 15 countries.The two keynote speakers address the learning of programming and computational thinking. Professor Mordechai (Moti) Ben-Ari from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, will give a talk titled In Defense of Programming, which defends the (perhaps controversial) position that programming is the fundamental activity of CS. In the other keynote talk Professor Maciej M. Syslo from Nicolaus Copernicus University and University of Wroc\l{}aw, Poland, will address algorithmic nand computational thinking as the way to computing for all students.ITiCSE is famous for its working groups. Participating in a working group provides a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group. It is also one of the best ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. Seven working groups have been accepted over a broad spectrum of topics. The working groups range from general topics, such as computing education terminology, CS education in K-9 and K-12 schools, and designing an IT curriculum framework for graduates in 2025, to more specific topics such as developing a repository for high school CS questions, visual assessment tools and metadata annotations, and how students construct solutions to programming problems. The leaders of the accepted working groups come from over 13 countries.Welcome to Vilnius and enjoy the vicennial ITiCSE conference and Lithuania's Statehood Day!},

@book{10.1145/2915031,
 abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media (such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets). This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people manage and analyze vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and capture semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to management and analysis of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.This book provides a systematic introduction to many of these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. Because humans can understand natural languages far better than computers can, effective involvement of humans in a text information system is generally needed and text information systems often serve as intelligent assistants for humans. Depending on how a text information system collaborates with humans, we distinguish two kinds of text information systems. The first is information retrieval systems which include search engines and recommender systems; they assist users in finding from a large collection of text data the most relevant text data that are actually needed for solving a specific application problem, thus effecively turning big raw text data into much smaller relevant text data that can be more easily processed by humans. The second is text mining application systems; they can assist users in analyzing patterns in text data to extract and discover useful actionable knowledge directly useful for task completion or decision making, thus providing more direct task support for users. This book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in information retrieval and text data mining from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of information retrieval and text mining to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. This book can be used as a textbook for computer science undergraduates and graduates, library and information scientists, or as a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in managing and analyzing text data.},

 abstract = {Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

 abstract = {Unsettled Artifacts: Technological Speculations from Latin AmericaFor the first time in SIGGRAPH history, the Art Gallery is dedicated exclusively to works by Latin American artists and designers: speculative artifacts that apply digital technologies to map alternative futures. The gallery presents 10 provocative projects from seven countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, and M\'{e}xico.Uncertain. Agitated. Disobedient. Unstable. Troubled. Historically, the Latin American artifact has been, above all, an unsettled object of study. Recent decades have demonstrated the impossibility of reducing the Latin American artifact to a single homogeneous concept, simply because the idea of Latin America is itself unsettled. The SIGGRAPH 2017 Art Gallery illuminates this reality and reimagines possible new worlds. It explores technology-based artistic practices produced beyond the traditional centers of industrial and technological development in territory that is often underrepresented, excluded, or ignored in the global narrative, and it shares new insights on how Latin American artists create, adapt, and use technology to critically confront a rich cultural context shaped by long histories of imperialism, colonization, and global asymmetry.},

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This second volume of the handbook begins with multimodal signal processing, architectures, and machine learning. It includes recent deep-learning approaches for processing multisensorial and multimodal user data and interaction, as well as context-sensitivity. A further highlight is processing of information about users' states and traits, an exciting emerging capability in next-generation user interfaces. These chapters discuss real-time multimodal analysis of emotion and social signals from various modalities and perception of affective expression by users. Further chapters discuss multimodal processing of cognitive state using behavioral and physiological signals to detect cognitive load, domain expertise, deception, and depression. This collection of chapters provides walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on tools and practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology, and tutorial support for mastering this rapidly expanding field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on the timely and controversial challenge topic of multimodal deep learning. The discussion focuses on how multimodal-multisensor interfaces are most likely to advance human performance during the next decade.},

 abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.},

@book{10.1145/3502398,
 abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing},

The Hyderabad edition is only the second in this promising series. The long hiatus due to Covid-19 pushed this conference by two years, but we are glad that it is finally here!This edition of ACM CompEd partly overlaps with COMPUTE 2023, ACM India's flagship conference on Computing Education. Having the two conferences adjacent to each other is a great way to build synergy between the Indian computing education community and the global community of computing education researchers.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference.

 abstract = {On behalf of the organizing committee, we are delighted to welcome you to the 33rd ACM International Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD). After the COVID-19 pandemic, we return to a fully in-person ISPD, held in Taipei, Taiwan for the first time. We continue the great tradition established by its thirtytwo predecessors, providing a premier forum to exchange ideas, highlight key technology challenges, present leading-edge theoretical and experimental contributions, and identify future research directions in this field. We extend the good practice, adopted during the pandemic, of having a YouTube channel to view the talks during the symposium and afterwards, improving access to the presentations.Across three days, ISPD 2024 has 3 keynotes, 18 accepted papers, 16 invited talks; one panel on Wednesday with 6 panelists; and 4 speakers with longer talks in Professor Martin D. F. Wong's commemorative session, and finally the ISPD 2024 contest results. ISPD 2024 is co-located with the 25th Workshop on Synthesis and System Integration of Mixed Information technologies (SASIMI). This year, we received a total of 62 abstracts and we received 48 full manuscripts, from which 18 were selected - a 37.5% acceptance rate. The regular papers in the ISPD 2024 program were selected, after a rigorous month-long double-blind review process and virtual meetings, by the Technical Program Committee with 20 outstanding international professionals from both academia and industry. These papers exhibit the latest advancements in a variety of topics in physical design, including partitioning and clustering; mixed cell-height placement and legalization; macro placement; global placement; standard cell design automation; timing and power optimization; reliability (IR drop); quantum circuits and quantum computing systems; and mask optimization in lithography. A number of these papers utilize advanced mathematical programming, satisfiability problem solving, GPU acceleration, and machine learning techniques.},

While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

 abstract = {We are pleased to present the 2024 edition of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, ACM ICMR 2024, that took place from 10-14 June 2024, in Phuket, Thailand.Effectively and efficiently retrieving information from multimedia collections (e.g., text, image, video, audio, sensor data, 3D) based on user needs is one of the most exciting areas in multimedia research. The Annual ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR) offers a great opportunity for exchanging leading-edge multimedia retrieval ideas among researchers, practitioners, and other potential users of multimedia retrieval systems. ACM ICMR was created in 2011 in a merger of ACM CIVR (International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval) and ACM MIR (International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval). ACM ICMR serves to illuminate the state of the art in multimedia retrieval. ACM ICMR 2024 in Phuket follows the successful previous editions of ICMR in Trento, Italy 2011; Hong Kong, China 2012; Dallas, USA 2013; Glasgow, UK 2014; Shanghai, China 2015; New York, USA 2016; Bucharest, Romania 2017; Yokohama, Japan 2018; Ottawa, Canada 2019; Dublin, Ireland 2020 (online); Taipei, Taiwan 2021 (online); Newark, USA 2022 (hybrid); and Thessaloniki, Greece 2023 (hybrid).},

 abstract = {Welcome to RESPECT 2024! The Conference on Research in Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology is the premier venue for research on equity, inclusion, and justice in computing and computing education. This volume contains the papers presented at RESPECT 2024, the ninth edition of this conference, held on May 16-17, 2024 at the Georgia Tech Conference Center and Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia.As researchers, especially those of us focused on equity, freedom, and justice, our job is to give language to and make meaning of the joy, trauma, and unwavering spirit of the most vulnerable and marginalized among us. We don't do this simply to shed light but to influence change. We stand when others are forced to sit and speak when others are silenced. For many of us, the past several years have rendered our usual tools ineffective, and often we find ourselves seated, scared to stand, and essentially silenced as we search for new language to describe old problems. We increasingly, and rightfully, feel frustrate... powerles... angry. Unfortunately, we sometimes allow these feelings to lead us to inaction. However, as the Black feminist scholar Audre Lorde wrote in her masterpiece, Sister Outsider, anger, directed in productive ways, can be transformative.},
