Background

The experience sampling method (ESM) builds an intensive time series of experiences and contexts in the flow of daily life, typically consisting of around 70 reports, collected at 8–10 random time points per day over a period of up to 10 days.
Methods

With the advent of widespread smartphone use, ESM can be used in routine clinical practice. Multiple examples of ESM data collections across different patient groups and settings are shown and discussed, varying from an ESM evaluation of a 6-week randomized trial of mindfulness, to a twin study on emotion dynamics in daily life.
Results

Research shows that ESM-based self-monitoring and feedback can enhance resilience by strengthening the capacity to use natural rewards. Personalized trajectories of starting or stopping medication can be more easily initiated and predicted if sensitive feedback data are available in real time. In addition, personalized trajectories of symptoms, cognitive abilities, symptoms impacting on other symptoms, the capacity of the dynamic system of mental health to “bounce back” from disturbance, and patterns of environmental reactivity yield uniquely personal data to support shared decision making and prediction in clinical practice. Finally, ESM makes it possible to develop insight into previous implicit patterns of thought, experience, and behavior, particularly if rapid personalized feedback is available.
Conclusions

ESM enhances clinical practice and research. It is empowering, providing co-ownership of the process of diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and routine outcome measurement. Blended care, based on a mix of face-to-face and ESM-based outside-the-office treatment, may reduce costs and improve outcomes.

Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for child anxiety, although efficacious, typically requires 16–20 weekly sessions with a therapist. Brief CBT (BCBT; eight sessions) for child anxiety is promising but may have less favorable outcomes owing to reduced session time. Mobile health (m-health) has the potential to improve BCBT efficacy by delivering ecological momentary intervention to engage youth in learning and practicing CBT skills in their everyday lives (in vivo). Materials and Methods: We developed an m-health platform entitled SmartCAT (Smartphone-enhanced Child Anxiety Treatment). SmartCAT consists of (1) a smartphone application (app) that cues youth to use the CBT skills taught in sessions, (2) an online portal that allows therapists to monitor skill use, to send cues and treatment-related materials, to engage youth in real-time via secure messages, and to manage rewards, and (3) a communication protocol that allows real-time bidirectional exchange between the app and the portal. A pilot study with nine youth (9–14 years old) examined the platform's feasibility as an adjunct to BCBT. Results: SmartCAT was found to be capable of supporting BCBT for child anxiety and received positive feedback from both therapists and youth patients. Patients rated the app as highly usable (mean=1.7 on a 1–7 scale, with 1=“easy”). Patients completed 5.36 skills coach entries per session (standard deviation=1.95) and took an average of 3.14 min (standard deviation=0.98 min) to complete the entries. Conclusions: A smartphone app is feasible within CBT for child anxiety. Users found SmartCAT both acceptable and easy to use. Integrating an m-health platform within BCBT for anxious children may facilitate involvement in treatment and dissemination of effective procedures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4011472/,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:0Cxu68lIZgQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.liebertpub.com

Online social media is now omnipresent in many people's daily lives. Much research has been conducted on how and why we use social media, but little is known about the impact of social media abstinence. Therefore, we designed an ecological momentary intervention study using smartphones. Participants were instructed not to use social media for 7 days (4 days baseline, 7 days intervention, and 4 days postintervention; N = 152). We assessed affect (positive and negative), boredom, and craving thrice a day (time-contingent sampling), as well as social media usage frequency, usage duration, and social pressure to be on social media at the end of each day (7,000+ single assessments). We found withdrawal symptoms, such as significantly heightened craving (β = 0.10) and boredom (β = 0.12), as well as reduced positive and negative affect (only descriptively). Social pressure to be on social media was significantly heightened during social media abstinence (β = 0.19) and a substantial number of participants (59 percent) relapsed at least once during the intervention phase. We could not find any substantial rebound effect after the end of the intervention. Taken together, communicating through online social media is evidently such an integral part of everyday life that being without it leads to withdrawal symptoms (craving, boredom), relapses, and social pressure to get back on social media.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:BoJva4IH1e8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.liebertpub.com

Virtues, broadly understood as stable and robust dispositions for certain responses across morally relevant situations, have been a growing topic of interest in psychology. A central topic of discussion has been whether studies showing that situations can strongly influence our responses provide evidence against the existence of virtues (as a kind of stable and robust disposition). In this review, we examine reasons for thinking that the prevailing methods for examining situational influences are limited in their ability to test dispositional stability and robustness; or, then, whether virtues exist. We make the case that these limitations can be addressed by aggregating repeated, cross-situational assessments of environmental, psychological and physiological variables within everyday life—a form of assessment often called ecological momentary assessment (EMA, or experience sampling). We, then, examine how advances in smartphone application (app) technology, and their mass adoption, make these mobile devices an unprecedented vehicle for EMA and, thus, the psychological study of virtue. We, additionally, examine how smartphones might be used for virtue development by promoting changes in thought and behavior within daily life; a technique often called ecological momentary intervention (EMI). While EMA/I have become widely employed since the 1980s for the purposes of understanding and promoting change amongst clinical populations, few EMA/I studies have been devoted to understanding or promoting virtues within non-clinical populations. Further, most EMA/I studies have relied on journaling, PDAs, phone calls and/or text messaging systems. We explore how smartphone app technology provides a means of making EMA a more robust psychological method, EMI a more robust way of promoting positive change, and, as a result, opens up new possibilities for studying and promoting virtues.

Background: Awake bruxism (AB) is an oral condition that has some uncertainties concerning the epidemiology, also due to the different diagnostic strategies that have been adopted to address it in the research setting. The recent new definition of AB suggests that an ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which enables real-time reporting of the condition under study, can implement knowledge on the topic.

Objectives: This article will discuss the general principles of EMA and EMI (Ecological Momentary Intervention) and comment on a preliminary dataset gathered with a smartphone application in a population of Italian young adults.

Materials and Methods: A dedicated smartphone application has been used (BruxApp®) on a sample of 30 University students (mean age 24 ± 3.5 years) to record real time report on five specific oral conditions (relaxed jaw muscles, tooth contact, teeth clenching, teeth grinding, mandible bracing) that are related with the spectrum of AB activities. Data were recorded over a 7-day period for two times, with a 1-month interval between the two observation periods. The purpose of collecting data over a second week, 1-month later, was to monitor AB behaviors over time, and test for potential “EMI” effects.

Results: Over the first 7 days (T1), the average frequency of relaxed jaw muscles reports at the population level was 62%. Teeth contact (20%) and mandible bracing (14%) were the most frequent AB behaviors. No significant gender differences were detected. One month later, during the second week of data collection (T2), the frequency of the conditions was as follows: relaxed jaw muscles 74%, teeth contact 11% and mandible bracing 13%.

Conclusions: These data recorded do not allow any generalization due the unrepresentativeness of the study population. On the other hand, they can be used as templates for future comparisons to get deeper into the study of natural fluctuations of AB behaviors as well as into the potential biofeedback effect of an ecological momentary assessment/intervention. It is important to recognize that the use of smartphone technology may help to set range of values for AB frequency in otherwise healthy individuals, in order to stand as comparisons for selected populations with risk or associated factors.

Bariatric surgery is the most effective means of long-term weight loss. Knowledge gaps and lack of engagement in pre-operative patients can result in suboptimal outcome after surgery. Mobile technology, utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA)/intervention (EMI), has shown tremendous promise in changing behaviors. The primary objective of the study is to assess feasibility of using smartphone app with EMA/EMI functionality to prepare patients for bariatric surgery.

Methods

Subjects seeking primary bariatric surgery were provided a smartphone app containing video-based education modules with linked assessments to evaluate mastery of topic. Subjects received algorithmic EMA text messages soliciting a response regarding lifestyle behavior. Upon answering, subjects received tailored EMI text messaging supporting healthy lifestyle.

Results

Thirty subjects (27 female and 3 male), with age of 41.3 ± 11.4 years and BMI of 46.3 ± 7.4 kg/m2 were enrolled. Twenty subjects completed the study. Ten subjects withdrew. On average, seven out of nine education modules were completed (70.9 ± 27.3 %), and 37.8/123 EMA were answered (30.7 ± 21.7 %), with response time of 17.4 ± 4.4 min. Subjects reported high satisfaction with the app. Many felt that the app fit into their routine “somewhat easily” or “very easily” (n = 12), had “perfect” amount of EMA messages (n = 8), and was very helpful in preparing for surgery (n = 7).

Conclusions

This study is the first to reveal the feasibility of using a smartphone app in the education and engagement of patients prior to bariatric surgery. The app was well-received based on subject satisfaction scores and revealed trends toward positive behavior change and increased weight loss.

This article reviews the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological momentary intervention (EMI) in clinical research applications. EMA refers to a method of data collection that attempts to capture respondents’ activities, emotions, and thoughts in the moment, in their natural environment. It typically uses prompts administered through a personal electronic device, such as a smartphone or tablet. EMI extends this technique and includes the use of microlevel interventions administered through personal electronic devices. These technological developments hold promise for enhancing psychological treatments by prompting the patient outside of therapy sessions in his or her day-to-day environment.

ABSTRACT

The current article describes the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Daily Life (ACT-DL) training, a new mobile health treatment protocol for ACT applied in a randomized controlled trial in early psychosis individuals. Between weekly ACT therapy sessions, patients fill out brief questionnaires on an app about their mood, symptoms, activity, and current context, thus promoting awareness - a crucial component of ACT. The app also provides them with visual cues and exercises specifically related to the ACT sessions, to help them implement the techniques previously learned in therapy into their daily lives. Here we assess the feasibility of this protocol in 16 early psychosis individuals, as part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Specifically, we investigate the experienced usefulness of the ACT therapy and app, and burden of the protocol. Results indicate that participants find both the therapy sessions and the app useful, and that ACT-DL guides them in putting ACT into everyday practice, although the protocol may be moderately burdensome. These findings indicate that ACT-DL may help early psychosis patients applying ACT skills to diverse contexts of everyday life. Since ACT is not symptom-specific, ACT-DL may also be suited for different target populations. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

Dietary guidelines typically specify rather complex goals and indicators for healthy food choices, such as nutrient and energy content patterns. However, translating these complex goals into practice in real life is often a major obstacle for many people. The present studies propose an intervention strategy for boosting healthy food choices by prompting consumers at a meaningful moment with a simple behavioural trigger, that is to eat a colourful lunch. Effectivity and feasibility of this intervention strategy were tested in two laboratory experiments and one real-life, smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Intervention.

Methods

In Studies 1 and 2, 83 / 42 participants self-served four meals (colourful, typical, healthy, and low-calorie) / three meals (colourful, typical, and varied) from a Fake Food Buffet. In Study 3, 80 participants recorded images of 1,210 lunch meals over a period of 3 weeks using mobile visual food recording. In the second week, participants additionally received a daily smartphone prompt to eat a colourful lunch. In all studies, participants were asked to rate the prompts’ feasibility.

Results

Prompting participants to eat a colourful meal increased the proportion of healthy foods consumed compared to typical meals in all three studies. In Studies 1 and 2, colourful meals contained more fruit and vegetables, while in Study 3 the prompt increased vegetable consumption. Furthermore, participants evaluated colourful meals to be the tastiest (Study 1) and most pleasant, and reported that the prompt was easy to follow and act upon.

Conclusions

Results suggest that prompting individuals to eat colourful meals is a promising strategy to facilitate healthy food choices in daily life.

ABSTRACT

Smartphone apps are suitable for delivering mental health treatment in real-time. This study aimed to develop and test the usability of one of the first smartphone app-delivered ecological momentary interventions for gambling (GamblingLess: Curb Your Urge), with key Australian stakeholders (ten consumers, nine gambling clinicians, and ten gambling researchers). Based on relapse prevention principles, the intervention comprised 10 activities to curb cravings, which were recommended to participants based on ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of gambling cravings. Participants tested the usability of the intervention over one-week and reported on the content’s helpfulness, the EMA’s relevance/burden, the Mobile App Rating Scale, and open-ended items assessing content and functionality. The intervention content, helpfulness, and usability were rated highly in quantitative and qualitative assessments. Participants liked practical and instructive content, but suggested that the intervention could be more engaging, interactive, and varied, and the number of EMA questions per timepoint could be reduced. These preliminary findings were promising for the intervention’s acceptability and usability. All groups indicated that they would recommend this app, as it could increase knowledge, attitudes, awareness, behavior change, intention to change, and help-seeking for gambling cravings. Further research is required to refine the intervention and examine its effectiveness with gamblers.

Abstract

Background
Emerging adulthood (18–25 years) represents a risky time for mental health and substance use. Emerging adults are particularly susceptible to problematic patterns of substance use, especially if they experience anxiety and/or depression and use substances as a way to cope with such issues. However, many mental health treatments do not address substance use. We developed an ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMA/EMI) to specifically target the motive of drinking to cope with anxiety/depression.

Methods
Project CHOICE was a 6-week intervention that paired in-person normative feedback with daily EMA and, if an individual reported negative affect and intent to drink, an EMI was immediately sent to their phone (a personally-chosen coping skill). We recruited n = 20 (55% female, mean age 21.74, 85% Caucasian and 75% non-Hispanic/Latino) individuals from a psychiatric partial hospitalization program for a 6-week open trial of the CHOICE intervention and re-assessed at the 6-week follow-up point.

Results
Results indicated that drinking variables and coping motives were highly correlated at baseline. Days of drinking, alcohol-related problems, and coping motives significantly decreased over time following the intervention. Results indicated high levels of feasibility and acceptability.

Conclusions
This open pilot represents a feasible, acceptable, and promising direction in delivering interventions in the moment when risk is highest, utilizing smartphone capabilities.

In this paper, we present m-Path (www.m-Path.io), an online platform that provides an easy-to-use and highly tailorable framework for implementing smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and intervention (EMI) in both research and clinical practice in the context of blended care. Because real-time monitoring and intervention in people's everyday lives have unparalleled benefits compared to traditional data collection techniques (e.g., retrospective surveys or lab-based experiments), EMA and EMI have become popular in recent years. Although a surge in the use of these methods has led to a myriad of EMA and EMI applications, many existing platforms only focus on a single aspect of daily life data collection (e.g., assessment vs. intervention, active self-report vs. passive mobile sensing, research-dedicated vs. clinically-oriented tools). With m-Path, we aim to integrate all of these facets into a single platform, as it is exactly this all-in-one approach that fosters the clinical utility of accumulated scientific knowledge. To this end, we offer a comprehensive platform to set up complex and highly adjustable EMA and EMI designs with advanced functionalities, using an intuitive point-and click web interface that is accessible for researchers and clinicians with limited programming skills. We discuss the strengths of daily life data collection and intervention in general and m-Path in particular. We describe the regular workflow to set up an EMA or EMI design within the m-Path framework, and summarize both the basic functionalities and more advanced features of our software.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1182175/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:HtA-5U6kSLsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

ABSTRACT

Background: Emerging adulthood is a critical period for the onset of both mental health disorders and problematic alcohol use. Coping strategies can play an important role in mitigating the onset and progression of these conditions in emerging adulthood. The current study examined daily mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use during an individualized, ecological momentary intervention (EMI).Objectives: To examine the within-person relationship between mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use.Methods: Emerging adults (N = 20, 55% female) in a partial hospital program for anxiety or mood disorders who endorsed drinking to cope completed a 6-week EMI to increase non-substance coping skills. The study also measured mood, coping strategy use, and alcohol use over the course of the intervention.Results: Mood and coping variables did not predict the likelihood of drinking on a given day. On drinking days, the number of pre-consumption coping strategies were related to reduced alcohol use (p =.02) and there was a significant interaction between negative mood and coping in predicting alcohol use (p <.01). When pre-consumption negative mood was high, coping strategies predicted decreased alcohol use (p =.02), but when negative mood was low, this relationship was nonsignificant.Conclusions: Using coping skills was associated with reduced alcohol use on days when negative mood was high. Increasing non-substance coping skills may help emerging adults reduce their alcohol use in response to negative mood.

Negative life events (LEs) are associated with mental health problems in youth. However, little is known about underlying mechanisms. The aim of the study was to investigate whether exposure to LEs modifies stress sensitivity in youth’s daily life.

Methods

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) was used to assess stress sensitivity (i.e., association of momentary stress with (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences) in 99 adolescents and young adults (42 service users, 17 siblings, and 40 controls; Mage 15 years). Before EMA, exposure to LEs (e.g., intrusive threats, experience of loss, serious illness) was assessed.

Results

Lifetime as well as previous-year exposure to LEs modified stress sensitivity in service users: they experienced more intense negative affect and psychotic experiences in response to stress when high vs. low exposure levels were compared. In contrast, controls showed no differences in stress sensitivity by exposure levels. Looking at specific types of LEs, controls showed less intense negative affect in response to stress when high vs. low exposure levels to threatening events during the last year, but not lifetime exposure, were compared. In siblings, no evidence was found that LEs modified stress sensitivity.

Conclusion

Stress sensitivity may constitute a putative risk mechanism linking LEs and mental health in help-seeking youth, while unfavourable effects of LEs on stress sensitivity may attenuate over time or do not occur in controls and siblings. Targeting individuals’ sensitivity to stress in daily life using novel digital interventions may be a promising approach towards improving youth mental health.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-022-02276-0,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:1KKLnd8LZTkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Background: Despite the growing potential of mobile-based technologies, innovative interventions targeting the reduction of acute stress in daily life remain under-researched. Music listening is an easy-to-administer activity that is associated with lower levels of biological and self-reported stress. However, the application of music as an intervention in moments of acute stress in daily life remains to be examined. We developed a just-in-time intervention delivering music in moments of stressful experiences in daily life and tested its feasibility using a mixed methods approach.

Methods: In this uncontrolled pilot study, the ecological momentary music intervention (EMMI) was tested by 10 chronically stressed women aged 23.5 ± 3.3 years. Over 18 consecutive days, whenever participants reported stressful experiences, they were encouraged to listen to a self-compiled playlist. Subjective stress levels and saliva samples were assessed at three time points per stress report (T0, upon reporting a stressful situation; T1, directly after music listening/15 min after T0 in case of no music listening; T2, 15 min after T1). We analyzed app-based log data, in-the-moment responses, questionnaire data, and semi-structured interview data.

Results: On average, participants’ compliance with the study protocol lay at 70%. Overall, 65 stressful experiences were reported, 51 of which were followed by music listening, for an average duration of 12:53 min. Complete data (i.e., self-reports and saliva samples at all three time points) were provided for 46 stressful experiences. Participants reported immediate relaxation and distraction through music listening. The interviews revealed that the intervention was easy to use and that music listening in moments of perceived stress was viewed as a new and pleasant activity. Several aspects of the protocol (e.g., number of items and prompts) were identified, which should be improved in future studies.

Conclusion: Since repeated stressful experiences in daily life can pose a threat to physical and mental integrity, interventions that are easily applicable and deliver support when needed most are necessary. Following minor adaptations, the EMMI can be considered as a feasible approach to target psychobiological stress responses in daily life, which is worthy of investigation in future larger-scale trials.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.927705/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:EK37ul8_hpcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

Abstract
Motivational deficits are an important predictor of functional outcomes in individuals with a serious mental illness such as schizophrenia and mood spectrum disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a group version of “Switch,” an intervention that targets motivational deficits, enriched with an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) approach (i.e., prompts on the participants’ smartphone to encourage the use of trained strategies in their daily life). Eight participants with schizophrenia, schizoaffective, or major depressive disorder entered the study. The intervention took place twice a week for 2 months. Assessment measures included traditional evaluations of motivational negative symptoms, apathy, quality of life and daily functioning, in addition to ambulatory assessment methods strategies, including the experience sampling method (ESM) to assess motivation and related processes, and actigraphy (daily step-count) to assess participants’ activity level. Four participants were considered as non-completers (followed less than 2/3 of the program) and four were considered as completers. Only completers presented a decrease in amotivation/apathy and an improvement in functional outcomes after the intervention and at follow-up. Furthermore, mixed-effects ESM models showed significant interaction effects on multiple processes related to motivation, indicating improvements only in completers: heightened motivation, increased engagement in meaningful and effortful activities, better mood, higher levels of confidence, increased frequency of projection into the future (pleasure anticipation), and of positive reminiscence. This preliminary investigation provides evidence that Switch may be an effective intervention, with specific effects on motivation and associated processes.

Background: Smoking urges and negative affect play important roles in daily cigarette smoking and smoking lapse during a cessation attempt. Traditionally, laboratory research has considered negative affect as a potential cause of smoking urges. A deeper understanding of momentary associations between negative affect and smoking urges during a smoking cessation attempt can inform treatment development efforts. This study examined whether the within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges differed before and after a quit attempt, and by intervention type.

Methods: Data are from a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing 3 smoking cessation interventions. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a novel, smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention that tailored treatment content in real-time (Smart-T2; n = 24), (2) the National Cancer Institute QuitGuide app (n = 25), or (3) a clinic-based tobacco cessation program (TTRP; n = 23) that followed Clinical Practice Guidelines. All participants received up to 12 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy and completed up to 5 assessments per day (MPreQuit= 25.8 assessments, SD = 6.0; MPostQuit= 107.7 assessments, SD = 37.1) of their negative affect and smoking urges during the 7 days (M = 6.6 days, SD = 1.0) prior to their quit-date and the 29 days (M = 25.8 days, SD = 6.4) after their quit-date. Prior to analysis, repeated measures of smoking urges were decomposed into between-person and within-person components.

Results: After accounting for baseline nicotine dependence, Bayesian multilevel models indicated that the extent of within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges was stronger in the post-quit stage of the intervention than the pre-quit stage. Results also indicated that in the post-quit stage of the intervention, the within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges was weaker for those in the Smart-T2 and TTRP groups compared with those in the QuitGuide group. The extent of this within-person association did not differ between those in the Smart-T2 and TTRP groups.

Conclusions: These findings offer preliminary evidence that the momentary within-person association between negative affect and smoking urges increases following a quit attempt, and that the TTRP and Smart-T2 interventions may weaken this association.

Background: As mHealth may contribute to suicide prevention, we developed emma, an application using Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention (EMA/EMI).

Objective: This study evaluated emma usage rate and acceptability during the first month and satisfaction after 1 and 6 months of use.

Methods: Ninety-nine patients at high risk of suicide used emma for 6 months. The acceptability and usage rate of the EMA and EMI modules were monitored during the first month. Satisfaction was assessed by questions in the monthly EMA (Likert scale from 0 to 10) and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS; score: 0–5) completed at month 6. After inclusion, three follow-up visits (months 1, 3, and 6) took place.

Results: Seventy-five patients completed at least one of the proposed EMAs. Completion rates were lower for the daily than weekly EMAs (60 and 82%, respectively). The daily completion rates varied according to the question position in the questionnaire (lower for the last questions, LRT = 604.26, df = 1, p-value < 0.0001). Completion rates for the daily EMA were higher in patients with suicidal ideation and/or depression than in those without. The most used EMI was the emergency call module (n = 12). Many users said that they would recommend this application (mean satisfaction score of 6.92 ± 2.78) and the MARS score at month 6 was relatively high (overall rating: 3.3 ± 0.87).

Conclusion: Emma can target and involve patients at high risk of suicide. Given the promising users’ satisfaction level, emma could rapidly evolve into a complementary tool for suicide prevention.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.952865/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:7sLvr9KO0FsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org

Abstract

Anxiety sensitivity (AS), defined as the fear of anxious arousal, is a promising therapeutic target to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom development after trauma exposure. Computerized AS interventions have been shown to be acceptable to individuals with PTSD symptoms and effective in achieving symptom reduction; however, to our knowledge, no research has examined AS interventions initiated in the immediate aftermath of trauma. We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of a brief (i.e., ∼75 min of psychoeducation, ∼2 hr of ecological momentary intervention) smartphone-based AS intervention in a pilot study. Participants were 12 women who presented for emergency care after sexual assault with high levels of peritraumatic PTSD symptoms. Most women who started the intervention completed the majority of it and reported using the techniques provided. Results indicated that participants perceived the intervention as logical and believed it would help in reducing their symptoms. Qualitative feedback was mostly positive but also indicated concern regarding intervention length. Although not the purpose of the study, results indicated medium-to-large, statistically significant decreases in AS, g = 0.74, and PTSD symptoms, g = 1.20. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that this novel smartphone-based intervention targeting AS was feasible, acceptable, and credible in this small sample of women receiving emergency care following sexual assault. Treatment outcome data must be considered in the context of natural recovery; however, these promising preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and credibility data support continuing to pilot the feasibility and potential efficacy of the intervention to reduce AS and prolonged PTSD symptoms.

Abstract

Robust reward sensitivity may help preserve mental well-being in the face of adversity and has been proposed as a key stress resilience factor. Here, we present a mobile health application, “Imager,” which targets reward sensitivity by training individuals to create mental images of future rewarding experiences. We conducted a two-arm randomized controlled trial with 95 participants screened for reward sensitivity. Participants in the intervention group received an ecological momentary intervention—Imager, which encouraged participants to create mental images of rewarding events for 1 week. The control group participants received only ecological momentary assessment, without the instruction to generate mental images. Adherence to Imager was high; participants in the intervention group engaged in 88% of the planned activities. In the follow-up assessment, the intervention group reported less mental health symptoms, mainly in depression (β = −0.34, df = 93, p = .004) and less perceived stress (β = −0.18, df = 93, p = .035), than control group participants and compared with the baseline assessment. Our results show the positive effects of Imager on mental health symptoms. The encouraging effects of the app on mental health outcomes may lead to greater use of ecological momentary interventions in the clinical preventive practice of affective disorders.

Excessive alcohol use is a major public health concern. With increasing access to mobile technology, novel mHealth approaches for alcohol misuse, such as ecological momentary intervention (EMI), can be implemented widely to deliver treatment content in real time to diverse populations. This review summarizes the state of research in this area with an emphasis on the potential role of wearable alcohol biosensors in future EMI/just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) for alcohol use.

Recent Findings

JITAI emerged as an intervention design to optimize the delivery of EMI for various health behaviors including substance use. Alcohol biosensors present an opportunity to augment JITAI/EMI for alcohol use with objective information on drinking behavior captured passively and continuously in participants’ daily lives, but no prior published studies have incorporated wearable alcohol biosensors into JITAI for alcohol-related problems. Several methodological advances are needed to accomplish this goal and advance the field. Future research should focus on developing standardized data processing, analysis, and interpretation methods for wrist-worn biosensor data. Machine learning algorithms could be used to identify risk factors (e.g., stress, craving, physical locations) for high-risk drinking and develop decision rules for interpreting biosensor-derived transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) data. Finally, advanced trial design such as micro-randomized trials (MRT) could facilitate the development of biosensor-augmented JITAI.

Summary

Wrist-worn alcohol biosensors are a promising potential addition to improve mHealth and JITAI for alcohol use. Additional research is needed to improve biosensor data analysis and interpretation, build new machine learning models to facilitate integration of alcohol biosensors into novel intervention strategies, and test and refine biosensor-augmented JITAI using advanced trial design.",,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:riP75-E25iwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",link.springer.com

Background: Mobile e-health technologies have proven to provide tailored assessment, intervention, and coaching capabilities for various usage scenarios. Thanks to their spread and adoption, smartphones are one of the most important carriers for such applications.

Problem: However, the process of design, realization, evaluation, and implementation of these e-health solutions is wicked and challenging, requiring multiple stakeholders and expertise.

Method: Here, we present a tailorable intervention and interaction e-health solution that allows rapid prototyping, development, and evaluation of e-health interventions at scale. This platform allows researchers and clinicians to develop ecological momentary assessment, just-in-time adaptive interventions, ecological momentary intervention, cohort studies, and e-coaching and personalized interventions quickly, with no-code, and in a scalable way.

Result: The Twente Intervention and Interaction Instrument (TIIM) has been used by over 320 researchers in the last decade. We present the ecosystem and synthesize the main scientific output from clinical and research studies in different fields.

Discussion: The importance of mobile e-coaching for prediction, management, and prevention of adverse health outcomes is increasing. A profound e-health development strategyand strategic, technical, and operational investments are needed to prototype, develop, implement, and evaluate e-health solutions. TIIM ecosystem has proven to support these processes. This paper ends with the main research opportunities in mobile coaching, including intervention mechanisms, fine-grained monitoring, and inclusion of objective biomarker data.",https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2023.1304089/full,"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:39DSWXWsf9EJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=%22ecological+momentary+assessment%22%7C%22experience+sampling%22+%22ecological+momentary+intervention%22+%22mobile%22%7C%22smartphone%22%7C%22app%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&as_vis=1",www.frontiersin.org
