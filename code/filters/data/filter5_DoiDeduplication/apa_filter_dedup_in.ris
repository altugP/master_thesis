N2  - Background: Nearly half of Americans taking prescription medications do not take them properly. The resulting implications have a broad impact. Nonadhering patients develop worsened medical conditions and increased comorbidity of disease or die. Objective: Clinical studies have shown that the most effective strategies for addressing adherence are those that are individualized to the context that each patient and situation require. However, existing aids for adherence are relatively ridged and poorly support adaptation to individual behaviors and lifestyles. The aim of our study was to better understand this design tension. Methods: A series of 3 qualitative studies was conducted: a web-based survey of 200 Americans that investigated existing adherence strategies and behaviors and perception of how hypothetical in-home tracking technologies would assist adherence; in-person semistructured interviews with 20 medication takers from Pittsburgh, PA, that investigated personal adherence behaviors, which included demonstration of medication locations and routines as well as an assessment of hypothetical technologies; and semistructured interviews with 6 pharmacists and 3 family physicians to gain a provider perspective on patient adherence strategies, which included feedback on hypothetical technologies in the context of their patient populations. Inductive thematic coding of all interview data was performed. Studies were conducted consecutively, with the results informing the subsequent studies. Results: Synthesized, the studies identified key medication adherence behaviors amenable to technological interventions, distilled important home-sensing literacy considerations, and detailed critical privacy considerations. Specifically, 4 key insights were obtained: medication routines are heavily influenced and adapted by and through the physical location and placement of medications relative to activities of daily living, routines are chosen to be inconspicuous to maintain privacy, the value of provider-involved routines is motivated by a desire to build trust in shared decision-making, and the introduction of new technologies can create further burden on patients and providers. Conclusions: There is considerable potential to improve individual medication adherence by creating behavior-focused interventions that leverage emerging artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and in-home Internet of Things (IoT) sensing technologies. However, success will be dependent on the technology's ability to learn effectively and accurately from individual behaviors, needs, and routines and tailor interventions accordingly. Patient routines and attitudes toward adherence will likely affect the use of proactive (eg, AI-assistant routine modification) versus reactive (eg, notification of associated behaviors with missed dosages) intervention strategies. Successful technological interventions must support the detection and tracking of patient routines that can adjust to variations in patient location, schedule, independence, and habituation.

N2  - Background: After childbirth, women undergo substantial physical and emotional changes. Therefore, it is important to provide them with information that helps them identify what is expected during this stage, as well as signs and symptoms that indicate complications after they have been discharged from the hospital. Objective: This study aimed to develop a health app-Towards Motherhood-that provides evidence-based information about the postpartum period and evaluate the usability of the app with the target population. Methods: This was a validation study involving 80 participants, including 24 professionals from the obstetric health field, 15 professionals from the technology field, and 41 postpartum women. The app was developed using React Native technology. Health professionals evaluated the app's content using the Content Validity Index, technology professionals completed a validated evaluation to assess the appearance of the app, and postpartum women completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) to measure the usability of the app. Results: The measurement of content validity using a Likert scale obtained an approval score of 99%. Regarding the app's appearance, 92% of responses were positive, reflecting favorable approval. The SUS usability score was 86.2, which represents excellent acceptance. Conclusions: The Towards Motherhood mobile app is a valid tool for promoting self-care during the postpartum period. The app's evidence-based information, user-friendly design, and high usability make it an essential resource for women during this critical stage of their live.

N2  - Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Management of chronic conditions such as MDD can be improved by enhanced patient engagement, measurement-based care (MBC), and shared decision-making (SDM). A user-centered design approach can improve the understanding of the patient journey and care team workflows and thus aid the development of digital health care innovations optimized for the needs of patients living with MDD and their primary care teams. Objective: This study aims to use qualitative research methods for the user-centered design of a digitally enabled MDD care platform, PathwayPlatform, intended to enhance patient engagement, MBC, and SDM. Methods: Insights were gathered through 2 stages of qualitative interviews by a study team with expertise in qualitative research and user-centered design methods. Thematic analysis was used to generate an overarching understanding of a set of shared experiences, thoughts, or behaviors across a broad qualitative data set, including transcripts of interviews, to allow both inductive and deductive insights to emerge. Thematic analysis of interviews was supported by Dedoose (SocioCultural Research Consultants, LLC), a qualitative data analysis software tool that enables systematized coding. Findings and insights were presented based on code frequency, salience, and relevance to the research project. Results: In stage 1, interviews were conducted with 20 patients living with MDD and 15 health care providers from September 2018 to January 2019 to understand the experiences with and perceptions about the initial functionality of the Pathway app while also exploring the perceptions about potential additional features and functionality. Feedback about care team workflows and treatment approaches was collected in stage-2 interviews with 36 health care providers at 8 primary care sites. Inductive and deductive thematic analyses revealed several themes related to app functionality, patient-provider engagement, workflow integration, and patient education. Both patients and their care teams perceived the remote tracking of patient-reported outcomes via digital tools to be clinically useful and reliable and to promote MBC and SDM. However, there was emphasis on the need to enhance the flow of real-time data shared with the care team, improve trend visualizations, and integrate the data within the existing clinical workflow and educational programs for patients and their care teams. User feedback was incorporated into the iterative development of the Pathway app. Conclusions: Ongoing communication with patients living with MDD and their care teams provided an opportunity for user-centric developmental iterations of the Pathway Platform. Key insights led to further development of the patient-facing and care team-facing visit preparation features, collaborative goal-setting and goal-tracking features, patient-reported outcome summaries, and trend visualizations. The result is an enhanced digital platform with the potential to improve treatment outcomes and provide patients living with MDD additional support throughout their treatment journey.

N2  - Persons with epilepsy (PWE) often report that seizure triggers can influence the occurrence and timing of seizures. Some previous studies of seizure triggers have relied on retrospective daily seizure diaries or surveys pertaining to all past seizures, recent and/or remote, in respondents. To assess the characteristics of seizure triggers at the granularity of individual seizures, we used a seizure-tracking app, called EpiWatch, on a smart watch system (Apple Watch and iPhone) in a national study of PWE. Participants tracked seizures during a 16-month study period using the EpiWatch app. Seizure tracking was initiated during a pre-ictal state or as the seizure was occurring and included collection of biosensor data, responsiveness testing, and completion of an immediate post-seizure survey. The survey evaluated seizure types, auras or warning symptoms, loss of awareness, use of rescue medication, and seizure triggers for each tracked seizure. Two hundred and thirty four participants tracked 2493 seizures. Ninety six participants reported triggers in 650 seizures: stress (65.8%), lack of sleep (30.5%), menstrual cycle (19.7%), and overexertion (18%) were the most common. Participants often reported having multiple combined triggers, frequent stress with lack of sleep, overexertion, or menses. Participants who reported triggers were more likely to be taking 3 or more anti-seizure medications compared to participants who did not report triggers. Participants were able to interact with the app and use mobile technology in this national study to record seizures and report common seizure triggers. These findings demonstrate the promise of longitudinal, self-reported data to improve our understanding of epilepsy and its related comorbidities.

N2  - Background: Since fall 2020, mobile health (mHealth) apps have become an integral part of the German health care system. The belief that mHealth apps have the potential to make the health care system more efficient, close gaps in care, and improve the economic outcomes related to health is unwavering and already partially confirmed. Nevertheless, problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps usually remain unconsidered. Objective: The focus groups and interviews conducted in this study aim to shed light on problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps from the perspective of patients. Methods: Guided focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with patients with a disease for which an approved mHealth app was available at the time of the interviews. Participants were recruited via self-help groups. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to a qualitative content analysis. The content analysis was based on 10 problem categories ("validity," "usability," "technology," "use and adherence," "data privacy and security," "patient-physician relationship," "knowledge and skills," "individuality," "implementation," and "costs") identified in a previously conducted scoping review. Participants were asked to fill out an additional questionnaire about their sociodemographic data and about their use of technology. Results: A total of 38 patients were interviewed in 5 focus groups (3 onsite and 2 web-based) and 5 individual web-based interviews. The additional questionnaire was completed by 32 of the participants. Patients presented with a variety of different diseases, such as arthrosis, tinnitus, depression, or lung cancer. Overall, 16% (5/32) of the participants had already been prescribed an app. During the interviews, all 10 problem categories were discussed and considered important by patients. A myriad of problem manifestations could be identified for each category. This study shows that there are relevant problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps from the perspective of patients, which warrant further attention. Conclusions: There are essentially 3 different areas of problems in the context of mHealth apps that could be addressed to improve care: quality of the respective mHealth app, its integration into health care, and the expandable digital literacy of patients.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: This study explored whether participants with substance use disorder (SUD) would adopt and use a smart-phone app with a cognitive behavioral therapy program, weekly Brief Addiction Monitor (BAM) assessments, daily check-ins, tools to track sobriety and treatment, and other patient-centered resources. In addition, participants with SUD could access a social worker and peer support specialists. Methods: The study sought participants from two groups: those referred by a justice-related agency and participants who responded to outreach from the Addiction Policy Forum (APF). The Connections smart-phone app was offered to both groups. The study examined use of the app and social worker/peer recovery support services by participants who downloaded and used the app; those referred by a justice-related agency and those who self-referred through APF. The app provided primary data, including socio-demographics, referral status, dates of use, activities completed, and BAM scores. Results: The app was offered to 1973 participants, 40% of whom downloaded it. Three groups emerged from among the 350 who used the app: those who used only the cognitive behavioral aspects of the app, those who used only the recovery support services offered, and those who used both the app and recovery support services. Looking at the two referral groups, the justice-referred group preferred telehealth recovery support services with the social worker; the self-referred group used the app and the app plus the recovery support services equally. Scores on the BAM improved across time. Justice-referred participants' protective behaviors improved more than those of the self-referred participants while self-referred participants' risk behaviors improved more than those of justice-referred participants. Older participants were more likely to use the app, and to report fewer risky behaviors, as measured by the BAM. Conclusions: Use of a digital therapeutic appears to support recovery of participants with SUD although many clients need and want the integration of social worker-driven recovery support services. Basically, the app can be an extension to personal services, but many people with SUD (particularly during COVID-19) crave human interaction. It also appears that those who seek assistance on their own, rather than being referred by a justice-related agency, may be more likely to benefit from digital therapeutics such as the Connections app. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: Depressive symptom dynamics, including change trajectories and symptom variability, have been related to therapy outcomes. However, such dynamics have often been examined separately and related to outcomes of interest using two-step analyses, which are characterized by several limitations. Here, we show how to overcome these limitations using location-scale models in a dynamic structural equation modeling framework. Method: We introduce location-scale modeling in an accessible manner to pave the way for its use in research integrating within-person dynamics and intervention-related change in psychopathology, and we illustrate this modeling approach in a large-scale internet-based intervention for depression (N = 1,656). Using eight data points sampled across about 8 weeks, we predicted improvement across the intervention (50% symptom reduction) as a function of early change and symptom variability. Results: Early symptom change was associated with a more likely improvement across therapy. Variability of symptoms beyond change trajectories during the intervention was associated with less likely improvement. Conclusions: Location-scale models, and dynamic structural equation modeling more generally, are well suited to modeling how patterns of symptom change during psychotherapy are related to important (e.g., therapy) outcomes. Our illustrative application of location-scale modeling showed that symptom variability was associated with less overall improvement in depressive symptoms. However, this finding requires replication with more intensive sampling of symptoms before final conclusions can be drawn on when and how to distinguish maladaptive from adaptive variability during psychotherapy.

N2  - Background: Distress is highly prevalent among patients with cancer, but supportive care needs often go unmet. Digital therapeutics hold the potential to overcome barriers in cancer care and improve health outcomes. Objective: This study conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of Mika, an app-based digital therapeutic designed to reduce distress across the cancer trajectory. Methods: This nationwide waitlist randomized controlled trial in Germany enrolled patients with cancer across all tumor entities diagnosed within the last 5 years. Participants were randomized into the intervention (Mika plus usual care) and control (usual care alone) groups. The participants completed web-based assessments at baseline and at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in distress from baseline to week 12, as measured by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer. Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue), and quality of life (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale). Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. Analyses of covariance were used to test for outcome changes over time between the groups, controlling for baseline. Results: A total of 218 patients (intervention: n = 99 and control: n = 119) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Compared with the control group, the intervention group reported greater reductions in distress (P = .03; etap2 = 0.02), depression (P < .001; etap2 = 0.07), anxiety (P = .03; etap2=0.02), and fatigue (P = .04; etap2 = 0.02). Per-protocol analyses revealed more pronounced treatment effects, with the exception of fatigue. No group difference was found for quality of life. Conclusions: Mika effectively diminished distress in patients with cancer. As a digital therapeutic solution, Mika offers accessible, tailored psychosocial and self-management support to address the unmet needs in cancer care.

N2  - Background: Despite young First Nations Australians being typically healthy, happy, and connected to family and culture, high rates of emotional distress, suicide, and self-harm are also observed. Differing worldviews of service providers and First Nations young people regarding illness and treatment practices, language differences, culturally inappropriate service models, geographical remoteness, and stigma can all inhibit access to appropriate mental health support. Mental health treatments delivered digitally (digital mental health; dMH) offer flexible access to evidence-based, nonstigmatizing, low-cost treatment and early intervention on a broad scale. There is a rapidly growing use and acceptance of these technologies among young First Nations people. Objective: The objective was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and use of the newly developed Aboriginal and Islander Mental Health Initiative for Youth (AIMhi-Y) app and determine the feasibility of study procedures in preparation for future assessments of effectiveness. Methods: This was a nonrandomized pre-post study using mixed methods. First Nations young people aged 12-25 years who provided consent (with parental consent where appropriate) and possessed the ability to navigate a simple app with basic English literacy were included. Researchers conducted one face-to-face 20-minute session with participants to introduce and orient them to the AIMhi-Y app. The app integrates culturally adapted low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, and mindfulness-based activities. Participants received supportive text messages weekly throughout the 4-week intervention period and completed assessments of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, substance misuse, help-seeking, service use, and parent-rated strengths and difficulties at baseline and 4 weeks. Qualitative interviews and rating scales were completed at 4 weeks to gain feedback on subjective experience, look and style, content, overall rating, check-ins, and involvement in the study. App use data were collected. Results: Thirty young people (17 males and 13 females) aged between 12 and 18 (mean 14.0, SD 1.55) years were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks. Repeated measures 2-tailed t tests showed improvements in well-being measures that were statistically and clinically significant for psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, 10-item) and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, 2-item). Participants spent on average 37 minutes in the app. The app was rated positively, with mean ratings of 4 out of 5 points (on scales of 1-5). Participants reported that they found the app easy to use, culturally relevant, and useful. The feasibility of the study was demonstrated with a 62% recruitment rate, a 90% retention rate, and high study acceptability ratings. Conclusions: This study supports earlier research suggesting that dMH apps that are appropriately designed with and for the target populations are a feasible and acceptable means of lowering symptoms for mental health disorders among First Nations youth.

N2  - Background: Hypertension is typically recognized in middle-aged and older adults but often overlooked in younger populations. Objective: We evaluated a mobile intervention for reducing blood pressure (BP) in college-age students for 28 days. Methods: Students with elevated BP or undiagnosed hypertension were assigned to an intervention or control group. All subjects completed baseline questionnaires and attended an educational session. For 28 days, intervention subjects sent their BP and motivation levels to the research team and completed assigned BP-reducing tasks. After 28 days, all subjects completed an exit interview. Results: We found a statistically significant decrease in BP in the intervention group only (P = .001) but no statistical difference in sodium intake for either group. Mean hypertension knowledge increased in both groups but was only significant for the control group (P = .001). Conclusions: The results provide preliminary data on BP reduction with greater impact on the intervention group. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Purpose: This prologue introduces the LSHSS Forum: Speech and Language Tele-Intervention: The Future Is Now. The aims of the forum are (a) to report on the process of moving established in-person interventions to virtual delivery and (b) to provide speech-language pathologists (SLPs) with empirically based guidance on designing and implementing tele-interventions, in order to support academic success for school-age children with speech and language needs. The included articles explore the process, benefits, and challenges of providing intervention in speech, language, and literacy domains in a virtual environment with children. Conclusion: Although there are some logistical challenges, established treatments such as those targeting morphosyntax as well as communication partner training can be adapted for successful delivery online. In addition, the forum supports the delivery of an app-based articulation-focused intervention. SLPs report a number of challenges in relation to adapting and delivering interventions through telepractice, and parents express concerns in relation to SLPs' online evaluation of complex speech sound difficulties for children born with cleft lip and palate. Finally, using the principles of Minimal Intervention Needed for Change, a systematic approach to the adaptation of evidence-based interventions for online delivery, is outlined.

N2  - ObjectivesDespite growing interest, the cost-effectiveness of eHealth interventions for supporting quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers remains unclear. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the FindMyApps intervention, compared to digital care-as-usual. FindMyApps aims to help people with dementia and their caregivers find and learn to use tablet apps that may support social participation and self-management of people with dementia and sense of competence of caregivers. MethodA randomised controlled trial (Netherlands Trial Register NL8157) was conducted, including people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia and their informal caregivers (FindMyApps n = 76, digital care-as-usual n = 74). Outcomes for people with MCI/dementia were Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), calculated from EQ-5D-5L data and the Dutch tariff for utility scores, social participation (Maastricht Social Participation Profile) and quality of life (Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit), and for caregivers, QALYs and sense of competence (Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire). Societal costs were calculated using data collected with the RUD-lite instrument and the Dutch costing guideline. Multiple imputation was employed to fill in missing cost and effect data. Bootstrapped multilevel models were used to estimate incremental total societal costs and incremental effects between groups which were then used to calculate Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. ResultsIn the FindMyApps group, caregiver SSCQ scores were significantly higher compared to care-as-usual, n = 150, mean difference = 0.75, 95% CI [0.14, 1.38]. Other outcomes did not significantly differ between groups. Total societal costs for people with dementia were not significantly different, n = 150, mean difference = -774, 95%CI [-2.643, .,079]. Total societal costs for caregivers were significantly lower in the FindMyApps group compared to care-as-usual, n = 150, mean difference =  -392, 95% CI [-1.254, -26], largely due to lower supportive care costs, mean difference = -252, 95% CI [-1.009, 42]. For all outcomes, the probability that FindMyApps was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 0 per point of improvement was 0.72 for people with dementia and 0.93 for caregivers. ConclusionFindMyApps is a cost-effective intervention for supporting caregivers' sense of competence. Further implementation of FindMyApps is warranted.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents are at elevated risk for depression. This risk is especially pronounced among adolescents whose home environment is unsupportive or nonaffirming, as these adolescents may face familial rejection due to their identity. Therefore, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms underlying this risk by probing temporally sensitive associations between negative mood and time spent in potentially hostile home environments. The current study included adolescents (N = 141; 43% SGM; 13-18 years old), oversampled for depression history, who completed clinical interviews assessing lifetime psychiatric history and depression severity as well as self-report measures of social support. Participants also installed an app on their personal smartphones, which assessed their daily mood and geolocation-determined mobility patterns over a 6-month follow-up period. Over the 6-month follow-up period, SGM adolescents reported elevated depression severity and lower daily mood relative to non-SGM youth. Interestingly, SGM adolescents who reported low family support experienced lower daily mood than non-SGM adolescents, particularly on days when they spent more time at home. Current findings reinforce evidence for disparities in depression severity among SGM adolescents and highlight family support as a key factor. Specifically, more time spent in home environments with low family support was associated with worse mood among SGM adolescents. These results underscore the need for clinical interventions to support SGM youth, particularly interventions that focus on familial relationships and social support within the home environment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Depression risk is elevated among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents, particularly those who live in unsupportive home environments. It is therefore critical to examine how time spent in a nonidentity-affirming home might be associated with worse clinical outcomes in SGM youth. Adolescents provided smartphone-derived geolocation and daily mood surveys for 6 months, providing an opportunity to explore associations between time spent in unsupportive homes and same-day mood. Results show that relative to their heterosexual peers, SGM adolescents with low family support reported lower mood on days when they spent more time at home, underscoring the need for digital interventions that may be accessible from within nonaffirming home environments.

N2  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation had a devastating effect on well-being. Veterans were among the most vulnerable given their high rates of military trauma-related conditions. Research supports that dogs can provide veterans with a sense of purpose, social support, and stress management. Digital storytelling provided a unique perspective with focus on a recognized hero, the veteran's dog, and an opportunity for engagement with other veterans during COVID-19. The purpose of the study was to assess the feasibility of this digital storytelling intervention based on Story Theory framework and tailored to encompass components of cross-generational collaboration in combination with individual and group virtual sessions as a mechanism to promote social engagement. The research was conducted using a descriptive exploratory design. Veterans (N = 8) were paired with a trained student and grouped in sets of four. There were eight guided 1-hour weekly virtual sessions to create their digital story. Demographic and pre-post intervention survey data were also collected. Based on eight established criteria, this article systematically evaluates the feasibility of the digital storytelling intervention for veterans. The findings suggest practical considerations to ensure viability of digital storytelling as a therapeutic intervention for veterans and other populations at-risk for suboptimal well-being.

N2  - We introduce a theoretical framework for conceptualizing Psychological Well-Being (PWB) as a process that unfolds over short and longer time-scales. We argue that this framework can be especially useful for studying the change mechanisms in PWB within the context of mobile Health (mHealth) interventions. Four lines of research are considered within this framework to inform the scientific exploration of PWB in the context of mHealth interventions. First, we explore key dynamic characteristics of change in PWB functioning. Second, we discuss PWB intervention response as a learning process (i.e., meaningful and transformational changes in state), reflected as change in key dynamic characteristics of PWB. Third, we explain mechanisms of change in PWB intervention practices through an underlying process of skill development. Fourth, we discuss intervention response heterogeneity within this framework. The approach we outline is intended to articulate currently unanswered, process-oriented research questions about PWB interventions, how they work, and a methodological path forward for exploring them.

N2  - Background: Combination therapies delivered remotely via the internet or mobile devices are increasingly being used to improve and promote the self-management of chronic conditions. However, little is known regarding the long-term effects of these interventions. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention program that measures associated variables such as catastrophizing, pain acceptance, and quality of life using a mobile device in people with chronic pain in an outpatient setting. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed using parallel treatment groups. A total of 209 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain were randomly assigned to one of the two study arms. The intervention group received a standard web-based psychosocial therapy-type program of activities through a smartphone for 6 weeks. The control group only had access to the Find out more section of the app, which contained audiovisual material for pain management based on a self-help approach. The primary outcome was catastrophizing measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). Secondary outcomes were pain acceptance measured using the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire and health-related quality of life measured using the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale. Assessments were conducted at baseline (T1), after treatment (T2), and at the 3-month follow-up (T3). The variations between the different phases were assessed using the percentage change rescaled with log base 2. The Cohen d was calculated based on the results of the linear mixed model. The investigators of the study who evaluated the results were not involved in patient recruitment and were blinded to the group assignment. Results: Positive effects were found in the intervention group (T2-T1) in catastrophizing between the baseline and posttreatment phases (P < .001) and in helplessness (-0.72 vs 0.1; P = .002), rumination (-1.59 vs -0.53; P < .001), acceptance (0.38 vs 0.05; P = .001), and quality of life (0.43 vs -0.01; P = .002), although no significant changes were found for magnification (0.2 vs 0.77; P = .14) and satisfaction with health (0.25 vs -0.27; P = .13). Three months after treatment, significant differences were observed in the intervention group for the outcome variable of catastrophizing (PCS; -0.59 vs 0.2; P=.006) and the PCS subscales of helplessness (-0.65 vs 0.01; P = .07), rumination (1.23 vs -0.59; P = .04), and magnification (0.1 vs 0.86; P = .02). Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that app-based mobile multidimensional treatments for adults with chronic pain improve catastrophizing, quality of life, and psychological flexibility immediately after treatment and that the effects are maintained for the primary outcome of catastrophizing for at least 3 months following treatment. Moreover, they promote self-management and can be used to complement face-to-face pain treatments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: We previously reported the efficacy of an 8-week home-based therapeutic immersive virtual reality (VR) program in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study. Community-based adults with self-reported chronic low back pain were randomized 1:1 to receive either (1) a 56-day immersive therapeutic pain relief skills VR program (EaseVRx) or (2) a 56-day sham VR program. Immediate posttreatment results revealed the superiority of therapeutic VR over sham VR for reducing pain intensity; pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress (but not sleep); physical function; and sleep disturbance. At 3 months posttreatment, therapeutic VR maintained superiority for reducing pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, and sleep (new finding). Objective: This study assessed between-group and within-group treatment effects 6 months posttreatment to determine the extended efficacy, magnitude of efficacy, and clinical importance of home-based therapeutic VR. Methods: E-surveys were deployed at pretreatment, end-of-treatment, and posttreatment months 1, 2, 3, and 6. Self-reported data for 188 participants were analyzed in a mixed-model framework using a marginal model to allow for correlated responses across the repeated measures. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, stress, and sleep at 6 months posttreatment. Secondary outcomes were Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance and physical function. Results: Therapeutic VR maintained significant and clinically meaningful effects 6 months posttreatment and remained superior to sham VR for reducing pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, and sleep (ds = 0.44-0.54; P < .003). Between-group comparisons for physical function and sleep disturbance showed superiority of EaseVRx over sham VR (ds = 0.34; P = .02 and ds = 0.46; P < .001, respectively). Participants were encouraged to contact study staff with any problems experienced during treatment; however, no participants contacted study staff to report adverse events of any type, including nausea and motion sickness. Conclusions: Our 8-week home-based VR pain management program caused important reductions in pain intensity and interference up to 6 months after treatment. Additional studies are needed in diverse samples. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Exposure and response prevention, a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy, is an effective first-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite extensive evidence of the efficacy of exposure and response prevention (ERP) from clinical studies and in real-world samples, it is still underused as a treatment. This is likely due to the limits to access to care that include the availability of adequately trained therapists, as well as geographical location, time, and cost barriers. To address these, NOCD created a digital behavioral health treatment for OCD using ERP delivered via video teletherapy and with technology-assisted elements including app-based therapy tools and between-session therapist messaging. Objective: We examined treatment outcomes in a large naturalistic sample of 3552 adults with a primary OCD diagnosis who received NOCD treatment. Methods: The treatment model consisted of twice-weekly, live, face-to-face video teletherapy ERP for 3 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of once-weekly brief video teletherapy check-ins for 30 minutes. Assessments were conducted at baseline, at midpoint after completion of 3 weeks of twice-weekly sessions, and at the end of 6 weeks of brief check-ins (endpoint). Longitudinal assessments were also obtained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after endpoint. Results: Treatment resulted in clinically and statistically significant improvements, with a 43.4% mean reduction in obsessive-compulsive symptoms (g = 1.0; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03) and a 62.9% response rate. Treatment also resulted in a 44.2% mean reduction in depression, a 47.8% mean reduction in anxiety, and a 37.3% mean reduction in stress symptoms. Quality of life improved by a mean of 22.7%. Reduction in OCD symptoms and response rates were similar for those with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms. The mean duration of treatment was 11.5 (SD 4.0) weeks, and the mean total therapist time was 10.6 (SD 1.1) hours. Improvements were maintained at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Conclusions: In this sample, representing the largest reported treated cohort of patients with OCD to date, video teletherapy treatment demonstrated effectiveness in reducing obsessive-compulsive and comorbid symptoms and improved quality of life. Further, it achieved meaningful results in less than half the total therapist time compared with standard once-weekly outpatient treatment, an efficiency that represents substantial monetary and time savings. The effect size was large and similar to studies of in-person ERP. This technology-assisted remote treatment is readily accessible for patients, offering an advancement in the field in the dissemination of effective evidence-based care for OCD.

N2  - Background: Sexual minority women disproportionately engage in heavy drinking and shoulder the burden of alcohol dependence. Although several intensive interventions are being developed to meet the needs of treatment-seeking sexual minority women, there remains a lack of preventive interventions to reduce drinking and its consequences among women not yet motivated to reduce their alcohol consumption. Objective: We aimed to examine the feasibility and efficacy of reducing alcohol-related risks via personalized normative feedback (PNF) on alcohol use and coping delivered within LezParlay, a social media-inspired digital competition designed to challenge negative stereotypes about lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ)-identified sexual minority women. Methods: Feasibility was assessed by examining engagement with LezParlay outside the context of an incentivized research study, assessing the characteristics of the LBQ women taking part, and examining the competition's ability to derive risk-reducing actual norms as well as levels of acceptability and perceived benefits reported by participants. Intervention efficacy was examined by randomizing a subsample of 499 LBQ alcohol consumers (ie, drinkers) already taking part in the competition to receive sexual identity-specific PNF on alcohol use and coping, alcohol use only, or control topics over only 2 rounds of play. Changes in alcohol use and negative consequences were examined 2 and 4 months after the delivery of treatment PNF. Results: A total of 2667 diverse LBQ women played >= 1 round of LezParlay. The competition attracted large numbers of moderate and heavy drinkers; however, risk-reducing actual norms could still be derived from competition rounds and featured in PNF. Efficacy results revealed that drinkers who received PNF on alcohol use and both alcohol use and coping had similar reductions in their weekly drinks (P = .003; P < .001), peak drinks (P < .001; P < .001), and negative consequences (P < .001; P < .001) relative to those who received PNF on control topics at the 2-month follow-up. However, at the 4-month follow-up, reductions in alcohol consumption outcomes faded among those who received alcohol PNF only (weekly: P = .06; peak: P = .11), whereas they remained relatively robust among those who received PNF on both alcohol use and coping (weekly: P = .02; peak: P = .03). Finally, participants found the competition highly acceptable and psychologically beneficial as a whole. Conclusions: The LezParlay competition was found to be a feasible and efficacious means of reducing alcohol-related risks in this population. Our findings demonstrate the utility of correcting sexual identity-specific drinking and coping norms to reduce alcohol-related risks among LBQ women and suggest that this approach may also prove fruitful in other stigmatized health disparity populations. To engage these populations in the real world and expand the psychological benefits associated with PNF, our findings also point to packaging PNF within a broader, culturally tailored competition designed to challenge negative group stereotypes.

N2  - Background: Although text messaging has the potential to be the core intervention modality, it is often used as an adjunct only. To improve health and alleviate the distress related to insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating of people living in urban areas, text messaging-based mindfulness-based interventions were designed and evaluated in 3 randomized controlled trials. Objective: This study investigated the effectiveness and mediating mechanisms of text messaging-based mindfulness-based interventions for people with distress related to insomnia, pain, or dysregulated eating. Methods: In these trials, 333, 235, and 351 participants were recruited online and randomized to intervention and wait-list control conditions for insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating, respectively. Participants experienced 21 days of intervention through WhatsApp Messenger. Participants completed pre-, post-, 1-month follow-up, and 3-month follow-up self-report questionnaires online. The retention rates at postmeasurements were 83.2% (139/167), 77.1% (91/118), and 72.9% (129/177) for intervention groups of insomnia, pain, and dysregulated eating, respectively. Participants' queries were answered by a study technician. Primary outcomes included insomnia severity, presleep arousal, pain intensity, pain acceptance, and eating behaviors. Secondary outcomes included mindfulness, depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and functional impairments. Mindfulness, dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep, pain catastrophizing, and reactivity to food cues were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between the intervention and outcomes. Results: For all 3 studies, the intervention groups showed significant improvement on most outcomes at 1-month follow-up compared to their respective wait-list control groups; some primary outcomes (eg, insomnia, pain, dysregulated eating indicators) and secondary outcomes (eg, depression, anxiety symptoms) were sustained at 3-month follow-up. Medium-to-large effect sizes were found at postassessments in most outcomes in all studies. In the intervention for insomnia, mediation analyses showed that dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep mediated the effect of the intervention on all primary outcomes and most secondary outcomes at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, whereas mindfulness mediated the intervention effect on presleep arousal at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. In the intervention for pain, pain catastrophizing mediated the effect of intervention on pain intensity and functioning at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups, whereas mindfulness only mediated the effect of intervention on anxiety and depressive symptoms. In the intervention for dysregulated eating, power of food mediated the effect of intervention on both uncontrolled and emotional eating at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups and mindfulness was found to mediate the effect on depressive symptoms at both 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Conclusions: These 3 studies converged and provided empirical evidence that mindfulness-based interventions delivered through text messaging are effective in improving distress related to sleep, pain, and dysregulated eating. Text messaging has the potential to be a core intervention modality to improve various common health outcomes for people living a fast-paced lifestyle.

N2  - Reports an error in "Exploring the effect of the dynamics of behavioral phenotypes on health outcomes in an mHealth intervention for childhood obesity: Longitudinal observational study" by Sarah Woo, Sunho Jung, Hyunjung Lim, YoonMyung Kim and Kyung Hee Park (Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2023[Aug][17], Vol 25[e45407]). In the original article, a figure number and some symbols were misnamed. In the second paragraph of the 'FPCA Results' subsection under the Results section, Figure 4 was misnamed as Figure 3. Changes were made in several sentences, as indicated in this correction. In addition, changes were made to two symbols in Figure 5. The corrected figure is provided. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2024-04151-001). Background: Advancements in mobile health technologies and machine learning approaches have expanded the framework of behavioral phenotypes in obesity treatment to explore the dynamics of temporal changes. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of behavioral changes during obesity intervention and identify behavioral phenotypes associated with weight change using a hybrid machine learning approach. Methods: In total, 88 children and adolescents (ages 8-16 years; 62/88, 71% male) with age- and sex-specific BMI >=85th percentile participated in the study. Behavioral phenotypes were identified using a hybrid 2-stage procedure based on the temporal dynamics of adherence to the 5 behavioral goals during the intervention. Functional principal component analysis was used to determine behavioral phenotypes by extracting principal component factors from the functional data of each participant. Elastic net regression was used to investigate the association between behavioral phenotypes and weight change. Results: Functional principal component analysis identified 2 distinctive behavioral phenotypes, which were named the high or low adherence level and late or early behavior change. The first phenotype explained 47% to 69% of each factor, whereas the second phenotype explained 11% to 17% of the total behavioral dynamics. High or low adherence level was associated with weight change for adherence to screen time (beta = -.0766, 95% CI -.1245 to -.0312), fruit and vegetable intake (beta = .1770, 95% CI .0642-.2561), exercise (beta = -.0711, 95% CI -.0892 to -.0363), drinking water (beta = -.0203, 95% CI -.0218 to -.0123), and sleep duration. Late or early behavioral changes were significantly associated with weight loss for changes in screen time (beta=.0440, 95% CI .0186-.0550), fruit and vegetable intake (beta = -.1177, 95% CI -.1441 to -.0680), and sleep duration (beta = -.0991, 95% CI -.1254 to -.0597). Conclusions: Overall level of adherence, or the high or low adherence level, and a gradual improvement or deterioration in health-related behaviors, or the late or early behavior change, were differently associated with weight loss for distinctive obesity-related lifestyle behaviors. A large proportion of health-related behaviors remained stable throughout the intervention, which indicates that health care professionals should closely monitor changes made during the early stages of the intervention.

N2  - Move&Connect-Youth (M&C-Y) is an interdisciplinary virtual group intervention for youth experiencing persisting symptoms after concussion (PSAC) that includes psychoeducation, active rehabilitation, and goal-setting. Using an intervention mapping framework, this paper describes the iterative development of M&C-Y and findings from initial feasibility testing. Ten youth participated in M&C-Y completing pre-intervention demographic questionnaires and semi-structured exit interviews to understand participants' experience and gather feedback. M&C-Y was feasible based on apriori criteria and findings from interviews provided insights related to: (1) intervention structure, (2) intervention engagement, and (3) intervention takeaways. M&C-Y is a meaningful, feasible, and engaging intervention for youth with PSAC. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Previous research has suggested that mobile phone applications (apps) may potentially increase quit rates. The purpose of this single-group cohort study sought to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel smartphone-based smoking cessation app designed for smoking cessation in China: smoking quit rate. Methods: A total of 180 smokers from two cities of mainland China with willingness to make a quit attempt were invited to this smoking cessation app program, a cognitive behavioral theory (CBT)-based smoking cessation intervention via a smartphone app. Participants received 37- to 44-day intervention (including 7- to 14-day pre-quit preparation and 33-day intervention from quit date). Feasibility and acceptability of the program, and smoking status were assessed at baseline stage (initial installation), pre-quit stage, and post-quit stage (days 7, 15, and 33 after quit date). Results: A total of 163 (90.6%) participants completed the study. Among them, 76-89% of the participants logged into the app >=1 time per day across stages (at baseline, during pre-quit stage, and on days 7, 15, and 33 of post-quit stage); approximately 90% of the participants were satisfied with the app across stages. A significant rise in self-reported overall satisfaction with the app is observed from baseline (93% at Time 1) to the end of the program (98% at Time 2, 33 days after quit date) (p = 0.021). Participants who believed/agreed this app can help them to quit smoking significantly increased from 69% at baseline to 97% at day 33 after quit date (p < 0.001). Participants were satisfied with most (80-90%) of the features, especially the information feature. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that the percentage of 33-day self-reported continuous prevalence abstinence was 63.9%, and 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate was 81.7, 87.2, and 77.8% on days 7, 15, and 33 after quit date, respectively. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the smartphone app intervention for smoking cessation and introduced a new digital treatment model, which is expected to overcome barriers facing accessing traditional in-person smoking cessation services and extend nationwide smoking cessation services in China.

N2  - Background: Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a key transdiagnostic mechanism underpinning depression and anxiety. Using "just-in-time adaptive interventions" via smartphones may disrupt RNT in real time, providing targeted and personalized intervention. Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluates the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes and mechanisms of Mello-a fully automated, personalized, transdiagnostic, and mechanistic smartphone intervention targeting RNT in young people with depression and anxiety. Methods: Participants with heightened depression, anxiety, and RNT were recruited via social media and randomized to receive Mello or a nonactive control over a 6-week intervention period. Assessments were completed via Zoom sessions at baseline and at 3 and 6 weeks after baseline. Results: The findings supported feasibility and acceptability, with high rates of recruitment (N=55), uptake (55/64, 86% of eligible participants), and retention (52/55, 95% at 6 weeks). Engagement was high, with 90% (26/29) and 59% (17/29) of the participants in the Mello condition still using the app during the third and sixth weeks, respectively. Greater reductions in depression (Cohen d=0.50), anxiety (Cohen d=0.61), and RNT (Cohen d=0.87) were observed for Mello users versus controls. Mediation analyses suggested that changes in depression and anxiety were accounted for by changes in RNT. Conclusions: The results indicate that mechanistic, targeted, and real-time technology-based solutions may provide scalable and effective interventions that advance the treatment of youth mental ill health.

N2  - Background: Digital phenotyping is a promising methodology for capturing moment-to-moment data that can inform individually adapted and timely interventions for youths with chronic pain. Objective: This study aimed to investigate adolescent and parent endorsement, perceived utility, and concerns related to passive data stream collection through smartphones for digital phenotyping for clinical and research purposes in youths with chronic pain. Methods: Through multiple-choice and open-response survey questions, we assessed the perspectives of patient-parent dyads (103 adolescents receiving treatment for chronic pain at a pediatric hospital with an average age of 15.6, SD 1.6 years, and 99 parents with an average age of 47.8, SD 6.3 years) on passive data collection from the following 9 smartphone-embedded passive data streams: accelerometer, apps, Bluetooth, SMS text message and call logs, keyboard, microphone, light, screen, and GPS. Results: Quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated that adolescents and parent endorsement and perceived utility of digital phenotyping varied by stream, though participants generally endorsed the use of data collected by passive stream (35%-75.7% adolescent endorsement for clinical use and 37.9%-74.8% for research purposes; 53.5%-81.8% parent endorsement for clinical and 52.5%-82.8% for research purposes) if a certain level of utility could be provided. For adolescents and parents, adjusted logistic regression results indicated that the perceived utility of each stream significantly predicted the likelihood of endorsement of its use in both clinical practice and research (Ps<.05). Adolescents and parents alike identified accelerometer, light, screen, and GPS as the passive data streams with the highest utility (36.9%-47.5% identifying streams as useful). Similarly, adolescents and parents alike identified apps, Bluetooth, SMS text message and call logs, keyboard, and microphone as the passive data streams with the least utility (18.5%-34.3% identifying streams as useful). All participants reported primary concerns related to privacy, accuracy, and validity of the collected data. Passive data streams with the greatest number of total concerns were apps, Bluetooth, call and SMS text message logs, keyboard, and microphone. Conclusions: Findings support the tailored use of digital phenotyping for this population and can help refine this methodology toward an acceptable, feasible, and ethical implementation of real-time symptom monitoring for assessment and intervention in youths with chronic pain.

N2  - Objective: Decades of research has found support for the motivational model of alcohol use at the between-person level, yet research on event-level drinking motives is in its nascent stage. Similarly, drinking context has been largely ignored in studies of day-level motives. Therefore, the present study sought to test whether drinking context mediates the relation between affect and motivation on drinking outcomes at both day and person levels. Method: Emerging adults who drank in solitary and social settings (N = 107; 61.2% female) completed 21 days ecological momentary assessments. Affect was assessed during morning/afternoon reports; drinking motives were assessed during afternoon reports; and past-night drinking context, drinking quantity, and negative consequences were assessed during next morning reports. Two-level multilevel structural equation models tested whether within-person and between-person levels of predrinking affect were indirectly associated with negative consequences through predrinking motives, drinking context (social vs. solitary), and drinking quantity. Results: At the day and person levels, positive affect was associated with higher social and enhancement motives. At the day level, positive affect indirectly predicted consequences through social motives, social (vs. solitary) drinking, and drinking quantity, whereas positive affect indirectly predicted consequences through enhancement motives and drinking quantity above and beyond context. At the day and person levels, negative affect was associated with coping motives, but coping was not associated with context, drinking quantity, nor consequences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that positive affect was linked to drinking outcomes through motives (enhancement and social) and contexts (social), whereas negative affect was not. Findings suggest that positively valenced drinking motives may be an important just-in-time intervention target. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Results suggested that both within-person deviations (and between-person levels) of social drinking motives as well as social drinking (at the within-person level in particular) were mechanisms of risk for alcohol misuse within a motivation framework. However, negative affect and coping motives were not. Findings add to skepticism related to negative reinforcement models of risk for addictive behavior in nonclinical samples and suggest that context and drinking motives may be important event- and person-level mechanisms to target in preventive interventions.

N2  - Background: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and digital mental health applications-has been increasingly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. As a resource-efficient treatment approach, bCBT appears promising for addressing the growing need for mental health care services, for example, as an early intervention before the chronification of symptoms. However, further research on the efficacy and feasibility of integrated bCBT interventions is needed. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel bCBT program comprising short (25 min), weekly face-to-face therapy sessions combined with a smartphone-based digital health app for treating mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. Methods: This prospective uncontrolled trial comprised 2 measurement points (before and after treatment) and 2 intervention groups. We recruited university students with mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. On the basis of the primary symptoms, participants were assigned to either a depression intervention group (n=67 completers) or an anxiety intervention group (n=33 completers). Participants in each group received 6 weekly individual psychotherapy sessions via videoconference and completed modules tailored to their respective symptoms in the smartphone-based digital health app. Results: The depression group displayed medium to large improvements in the symptoms of depression (Cohen d=-0.70 to -0.90; P<.001). The anxiety group experienced significant improvements in the symptoms of generalized anxiety assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale with a large effect size (Cohen d=-0.80; P<.001) but not in symptoms of anxiety assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Cohen d=-0.35; P=.06). In addition, both groups experienced significant improvements in their perceived self-efficacy (Cohen d=0.50; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.71; P<.001 in the anxiety group) and quality of life related to psychological health (Cohen d=0.87; P<.001 in the depression group and Cohen d=0.40; P=.03 in the anxiety group). Work and social adjustment of patients improved significantly in the depression group (Cohen d=-0.49; P<.001) but not in the anxiety group (Cohen d=-0.06; P=.72). Patients' mental health literacy improved in the anxiety group (Cohen d=0.45; P=.02) but not in the depression group (Cohen d=0.21; P=.10). Patient satisfaction with the bCBT program and ratings of the usability of the digital app were high in both treatment groups. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a novel brief bCBT intervention. The intervention effects were generalized across a broad spectrum of patient-reported outcomes. Hence, the newly developed bCBT intervention appears promising for treating mild to moderate depression and anxiety in young adults. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Reports an error in "Validation of the Social Effort and Conscientious Scale (SEACS) in schizophrenia" by Renata Botello, Kathryn Gill, Jessica L. Mow, Lawrence Leung, Jasmine Mote, Kim T. Mueser, David E. Gard and Daniel Fulford (Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 2023[Sep], Vol 45[3], 844-852). The originally published version of this article contained important typos. Upon reviewing the publication, it is identified that a typo in the name of the scale, as presented in both the title and body of the manuscript. "Conscientious" should be changed to "Conscientiousness" in the title ("Validation of the Social Effort and Conscientiousness Scale (SEACS) in Schizophrenia") and in the methods section. It is important to correct this typo as it changes the meaning and name of the scale itself. Consistency in the scale's name is crucial, as it can impact future studies hoping to use the SEACS. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-49983-001). People with schizophrenia often experience impaired social functioning and low satisfaction with relationships. Existing measures of social impairment in schizophrenia primarily assess pleasure derived from social interactions, rather than examining impairments in social motivation, including effortful behavior. We conducted a validation study of a recently developed self-report measure of social effort in 31 participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including tests of association with standard assessments of social functioning and behavior in daily life using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). We also assessed predictive validity of the scale, measuring the extent to which social effort at baseline predicted changes in social functioning over a 60-day smartphone-based social intervention. Higher social effort was associated with greater social functioning and lower negative symptom severity at baseline. Baseline social effort did not predict changes in social functioning over the intervention period, nor was it related to EMA-reported social experiences. Thus, tendencies toward social effort exertion may capture meaningful variance in gold-standard assessments of social functioning and negative symptoms, but may not track with social experiences in daily life. Further research should examine whether social effort is sensitive to change, and evaluate the utility of targeting social effort in evidence-based interventions for improving the social functioning in schizophrenia.

N2  - Background: Depression is a hidden burden, yet it is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite the adverse effects of depression, fewer than one-third of patients receive care. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (i-CBT) is an effective treatment for depression, and combining i-CBT with supervised care could make the therapy scalable and effective. A stepped care model is a framework for beginning treatment with an effective and low-intensity intervention while adapting care based on the patient's needs. Objective: This study investigated the efficacy of a stepped care i-CBT model for depression based on changes in self-reported depressive symptoms. Methods: In this single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, participants were allocated to either the i-CBT-only group (28/56, 50%) or the i-CBT with stepped care group (28/56, 50%). Both groups received a 13-week i-CBT program tailored for depression. The i-CBT program was provided through a secure, online mental health clinic called the Online Psychotherapy Tool. Participants read through the sessions and completed the assignments related to each session. Participants in the stepped care group received additional interventions from their care provider based on standard questionnaire scores (ie, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology [QIDS], and Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form) and their assignment responses. From lowest to highest intensity, the additional interventions included SMS text messages, phone calls, video calls, or a video call with a psychiatrist. Results: For this study, 56 participants were recruited to complete an i-CBT program (n=28, 50%; mean age 37.9; SD 13.08 y; 7/28, 27% were men) or an i-CBT with stepped care program (n=28, 50%; mean age 40.6; SD 14.28 y; 11/28, 42% were men). The results of this study indicate that the i-CBT program was effective in significantly reducing depressive symptoms, as measured by the PHQ-9 (F4,80=9.95; P<.001) and QIDS (F2,28=5.73; P=.008); however, there were no significant differences in the reduction of depressive symptoms between the 2 groups (PHQ-9: F4,80=0.43; P=.78; QIDS: F2,28=3.05; P=.06). The stepped care group was not significantly better in reducing depressive symptoms than the i-CBT group (PHQ-9, P=.79; QIDS, P=.06). Although there were no significant differences observed between the number of participants who completed the program between the groups (chi21=2.6; P=.10), participants in the stepped care group, on average, participated in more sessions than those who prematurely terminated participation in the i-CBT group (t55=-2; P=.03; 95% CI -4.83 to -0.002). Conclusions: Implementing a stepped care approach in i-CBT is an effective treatment for depression, and the stepped care model can assist patients to complete more sessions in their treatment.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - The impact and use of digital health tools vary considerably among individuals dealing with somatic illnesses, such as cancer. This variability can be attributed to several factors, such as sociodemographic characteristics, baseline mental health, perception of the intervention's usefulness, ease of use, and early engagement with the system. In this thesis, we aimed to examine the influence and interaction among these indicators on the usability, acceptability, satisfaction, and clinical effectiveness of a digital health tool in individuals with breast and prostate cancer. All studies were based on data from the NEVERMIND trial, a clinical randomized controlled trial that included patients with five different somatic illnesses. Our study included 255 participants (at baseline) who were diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer. Half of the participants (n=129) were allocated to the NEVERMIND system, whereas the other half (n=125) were allocated to the treatment as usual (control) group. Those in the NEVERMIND system group were involved in the use of the NEVERMIND digital health tool, comprising a mobile app and sensorized shirt (shirt), over a 12-week period. Data from baseline assessments and follow-ups at four and 12 weeks were used. The aim was to assess the usability, acceptability, and satisfaction of the NEVERMIND system, as well as the factors associated with these dimensions. This Ph.D. project also examined how usability and acceptability impacted the clinical effectiveness of the NEVERMIND system on depressive and stress symptoms. Study I. We investigated the association between baseline sociodemographic characteristics and usability assessed at four and 12 weeks of using the NEVERMIND system among 108 patients with breast and prostate cancer who received and used the system. The NEVERMIND system had good usability according to the usability questionnaires. Higher favourability of the mobile app was observed among women (breast cancer patients) compared to men (prostate cancer patients); however, men had significantly higher use of the overall system. Study II. The relationships between sex, education, baseline depressive and stress symptoms, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and system usage at various stages were examined using Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling in a path analysis of 129 patients with breast and prostate cancer. Higher perceived usefulness and initial usage were associated with a higher level of usage at 12 weeks. The results indicated that a better understanding of the system's benefits and early engagement were key drivers of its sustained use and clinical effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes. Study III. In a sample of 255 patients with breast and prostate cancer, we examined the relationship between the clinical effectiveness, usability, and acceptability of the NEVERMIND system when treating depressive and stress symptoms in patients with breast and prostate cancer. The results showed that patients in the NEVERMIND group had a greater reduction in depressive symptoms than those in the control group at the 12-week follow-up. The findings also showed that users who utilized the system for more than six weeks experienced a statistically significant decrease in both depressive symptoms and stress symptoms compared to those who used it for less than two weeks.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed nonskin cancer for Canadian men and has one of the highest 5-year survival rates, straining systems to provide care. Virtual care can be one way to relieve this strain, but survivors' care needs and technology use are influenced by intersecting social and cultural structures. Cultural adaptation has been posited as an effective method to tailor existing interventions to better serve racialized communities, including Chinese men. However, cultural adaptations may inadvertently draw attention away from addressing structural inequities. Objective: This study used qualitative methods to (1) explore the perceptions and experiences of Chinese Canadian PCa survivors with follow-up and virtual care, and (2) identify implications for the cultural adaptation of a PCa follow-up care app, the Ned (no evidence of disease) Clinic. Methods: An axiology of relational accountability and a relational paradigm underpinned our phenomenologically informed exploratory-descriptive qualitative study design. A community-based participatory approach was used, informed by cultural safety and user-centered design principles, to invite Chinese Canadian PCa survivors and their caregivers to share their stories. Data were inductively analyzed to explore their unmet needs, common experiences, and levels of digital literacy. Results: Unmet needs and technology preferences were similar to broader trends within the wider community of PCa survivors. However, participants indicated that they felt uncomfortable, unable to, or ignored when expressing their needs. Responses spoke to a sense of isolation and reflected a reliance on culturally informed coping mechanisms, such as "eating bitterness," and familial assistance to overcome systemic barriers and gaps in care. Moreover, virtual care was viewed as "better than nothing;" it did not change a perceived lack of focus on improving quality of life or care continuity in survivorship care. Systemic changes were identified as likely to be more effective in improving care delivery and well-being rather than the cultural adaptation of Ned for Chinese Canadians. Participants' desires for care reflected accessibility issues that were not culturally specific to Chinese Canadians. Conclusions: Chinese Canadian survivors are seeking to strengthen their connections in a health care system that provides privacy and accessibility, protects relationality, and promotes transparency, accountability, and responsibility. Designing "trickle-up" adaptations that address structural inequities and emphasize accessibility, relationality, and privacy may be more effective and efficient at improving care than creating cultural adaptations of interventions.

N2  - Background: People with a low socioeconomic position (SEP) are less likely to benefit from eHealth interventions, exacerbating social health inequalities. Professionals developing eHealth interventions for this group face numerous challenges. A comprehensive guide to support these professionals in their work could mitigate these inequalities. Objective: We aimed to develop a web-based guide to support professionals in the development, adaptation, evaluation, and implementation of eHealth interventions for people with a low SEP. Methods: This study consisted of 2 phases. The first phase involved a secondary analysis of 2 previous qualitative and quantitative studies. In this phase, we synthesized insights from the previous studies to develop the guide's content and information structure. In the second phase, we used a participatory design process. This process included iterative development and evaluation of the guide's design with 11 professionals who had experience with both eHealth and the target group. We used test versions (prototypes) and think-aloud testing combined with semistructured interviews and a questionnaire to identify design requirements and develop and adapt the guide accordingly. Results: The secondary analysis resulted in a framework of recommendations for developing the guide, which was categorized under 5 themes: development, reach, adherence, evaluation, and implementation. The participatory design process resulted in 16 requirements on system, content, and service aspects for the design of the guide. For the system category, the guide was required to have an open navigation strategy leading to more specific information and short pages with visual elements. Content requirements included providing comprehensible information, scientific evidence, a user perspective, information on practical applications, and a personal and informal tone of voice. Service requirements involved improving suitability for different professionals, ensuring long-term viability, and a focus on implementation. Based on these requirements, we developed the final version of "the inclusive eHealth guide." Conclusions: The inclusive eHealth guide provides a practical, user-centric tool for professionals aiming to develop, adapt, evaluate, and implement eHealth interventions for people with a low SEP, with the aim of reducing health disparities in this population. Future research should investigate its suitability for different end-user goals, its external validity, its applicability in specific contexts, and its real-world impact on social health inequality.

N2  - Background: There is currently an increased interest in and acceptance of technology-enabled mental health care. To adequately harness this opportunity, it is critical that the design and development of digital mental health technologies be informed by the needs and preferences of end users. Despite young people and clinicians being the predominant users of such technologies, few studies have examined their perspectives on different digital mental health technologies. Objective: This study aims to understand the technologies that young people have access to and use in their everyday lives and what applications of these technologies they are interested in to support their mental health. The study also explores the technologies that youth mental health clinicians currently use within their practice and what applications of these technologies they are interested in to support their clients' mental health. Methods: Youth mental health service users (aged 12-25 years) from both primary and specialist services, young people from the general population (aged 16-25 years), and youth mental health clinicians completed a web-based survey exploring technology ownership, use of, and interest levels in using different digital interventions to support their mental health or that of their clients. Results: A total of 588 young people and 73 youth mental health clinicians completed the survey. Smartphone ownership or private access among young people within mental health services and the general population was universal (611/617, 99%), with high levels of access to computers and social media. Youth technology use was frequent, with 63.3% (387/611) using smartphones several times an hour. Clinicians reported using smartphones (61/76, 80%) and video chat (69/76, 91%) commonly in clinical practice and found them to be helpful. Approximately 50% (296/609) of the young people used mental health apps, which was significantly less than the clinicians (chi23=28.8, n = 670; P < .001). Similarly, clinicians were significantly more interested in using technology for mental health support than young people (H3 = 55.90; P < .001), with 100% (73/73) of clinicians being at least slightly interested in technology to support mental health compared with 88% (520/591) of young people. Follow-up tests revealed no difference in interest between young people from the general population, primary mental health services, and specialist mental health services (all P > .23). Young people were most interested in web-based self-help, mobile self-help, and blended therapy. Conclusions: Technology access is pervasive among young people within and outside of youth mental health services; clinicians are already using technology to support clinical care, and there is widespread interest in digital mental health technologies among these groups of end users. These findings provide important insights into the perspectives of young people and clinicians regarding the value of digital mental health interventions in supporting youth mental health.

N2  - Background: The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and Insomnia Severity Index-2 (ISI-2) are screening assessments that reflect the past 2-week experience of depression and insomnia, respectively. Retrospective assessment has been associated with reduced accuracy owing to recall bias. Objective: This study aimed to increase the reliability of responses by validating the use of the PHQ-2 and ISI-2 for daily screening. Methods: A total of 167 outpatients from the psychiatric department at the Yongin Severance Hospital participated in this study, of which 63 (37.7%) were male and 104 (62.3%) were female with a mean age of 35.1 (SD 12.1) years. Participants used a mobile app ("Mental Protector") for 4 weeks and rated their depressive and insomnia symptoms daily on the modified PHQ-2 and ISI-2 scales. The validation assessments were conducted in 2 blocks, each with a fortnight response from the participants. The modified version of the PHQ-2 was evaluated against the conventional scales of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised. Results: According to the sensitivity and specificity analyses, an average score of 3.29 on the modified PHQ-2 was considered valid for screening for depressive symptoms. Similarly, the ISI-2 was evaluated against the conventional scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and a mean score of 3.50 was determined to be a valid threshold for insomnia symptoms when rated daily. Conclusions: This study is one of the first to propose a daily digital screening measure for depression and insomnia delivered through a mobile app. The modified PHQ-2 and ISI-2 were strong candidates for daily screening of depression and insomnia, respectively.

N2  - Background: Blended cognitive behavioral therapy (bCBT)-the combination of digital elements and face-to-face psychotherapy-has been proposed to alleviate challenges that patients and therapists face in conventional cognitive behavioral therapy. There is growing evidence that adding digital elements to face-to-face psychotherapy can contribute to better treatment outcomes. However, bCBT programs still show considerable shortcomings, and knowledge on how to improve digital apps using a bCBT protocol is limited. Objective: This study aimed to inductively identify functions and qualities that are expected from a bCBT treatment for depression in the eyes of patients and psychotherapists who were not currently receiving or practicing bCBT treatment. Methods: We used a qualitative exploratory study design and conducted 3 focus group interviews (n = 6 in each) and 5 semistructured in-depth interviews with therapists as well as 11 individual interviews with patients with a primary diagnosis of depression and currently undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy treatment in Germany. Themes and categories were established inductively from transcribed interview records based on a rigorous coding method. Results: Both therapists and patients expected a digital app to provide patients with the opportunity to track their mood, work on therapeutic homework activities, easily access an intervention set for harder moments, and efficiently facilitate administrative tasks. The desire to be able to customize bCBT protocols to individual patient circumstances was evident in both patient and therapist interviews. Patients differed with respect to what content and the amount of material the app should focus on as well as the method of recording experiences. Therapists viewed digital apps as potentially aiding in their documentation work outside of sessions. Different attitudes surfaced on the topic of data security, with patients not as concerned as therapists. Conclusions: Both patients and therapists had substantially positive attitudes toward the option of an integrated bCBT treatment. Our study presents novel findings on the expectations and attitudes of patients and therapists. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: The effectiveness of virtual reality exposure (VRE) in the treatment of anxiety disorders is well established. Several psychological mechanisms of VRE have been identified, whereby both emotional processing and the sense of presence play a key role. However, there are only few studies that contribute to our knowledge of examples of implementation in the case of VRE for claustrophobia based on patients' experiences and the perspective of therapists. Objective: This study asks for key elements of a VRE app that are necessary for effective exposure for people with claustrophobic symptoms. Methods: A mixed methods design was applied in which patients (n = 15) and therapeutic experts (n = 15) tested a VRE intervention of an elevator ride at 5 intensity levels. Intensity was varied by elevator size, duration of the elevator ride, and presence of virtual humans. Quantitative measures examined self-reported presence with the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) ranging from 0 to 6 and 15 Likert-scaled evaluation items that had been developed for the purpose of this study, ranging from 1 to 5. In both measures, higher scores indicate higher levels of presence or agreement. Think-aloud protocols of the patients and semistructured interviews posttreatment of all participants were conducted to gain in-depth perspectives on emotional processes. Results: The intervention induced a feeling of presence in patients and experts, posttreatment scores showed a high IPQ presence score (mean 3.84, SD 0.88), with its subscores IPQ spatial presence (mean 4.53, SD 1.06), IPQ involvement (mean 3.83, SD 1.22), and IPQ experienced realism (mean 2.75, SD 1.02). Patients preferred a setting in the presence of a therapist (mean 4.13, SD 0.83) more than the experts did (mean 3.33, SD 1.54). Think-aloud protocols of the patients revealed that presence and anxiety both were achieved. Qualitative interviews of patients and experts uncovered 8 topics: feelings and emotions, personal story, telepresence, potential therapeutic effects, barriers, conditions and requirements, future prospects, and realization. The intensity levels were felt to appropriately increase in challenge, with ambivalent results regarding the final level. Virtual humans contributed to feelings of fear. Conclusions: Key elements of a VRE app for claustrophobic symptoms should include variation of intensity by adding challenging cues in order to evoke presence and anxiety. Virtual humans are a suitable possibility to make the intervention realistic and to provide a sense of closeness; however, some of the fears might then be related to symptoms of social phobia or agoraphobia. Patients may need the physical presence of a therapist, though not all of them share this view. A higher degree of sophistication in the intensity levels is needed to deliver targeted help for specific symptoms of anxiety. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Common mental health disorders (CMDs) are leading causes of disability globally. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the burden of CMDs. COVID-19 containment measures, including lockdowns, have disrupted access to in-person mental health care. It is therefore imperative to explore the utility of digital mental health interventions to bridge the treatment gap. Mobile health technologies are effective tools for increasing access to treatment at a lower cost. This study explores the utility of Inuka, a chat-based app hinged on the Friendship Bench problem-solving therapy intervention. The Inuka app offers double anonymity, and clients can book or cancel a session at their convenience. Inuka services can be accessed either through a mobile app or the web. Objective: We aimed to explore the feasibility of conducting a future clinical trial. Additionally, we evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, scalability, and preliminary effectiveness of Inuka. Methods: Data were collected using concurrent mixed methods. We used a pragmatic quasiexperimental design to compare the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical effectiveness of Inuka (experimental group) and WhatsApp chat-based counseling (control). Participants received 6 problem-solving therapy sessions delivered by lay counselors. A reduction in CMDs was the primary clinical outcome. The secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability and functioning, and social support. Quantitative outcomes were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistics. Finally, we used administrative data and semistructured interviews to gather data on acceptability and feasibility; this was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Altogether, 258 participants were screened over 6 months, with 202 assessed for eligibility, and 176 participants were included in the study (recruitment ratio of 29 participants/month). The participants' mean age was 24.4 (SD 5.3) years, and most participants were female and had tertiary education. The mean daily smartphone usage was 8 (SD 3.5) hours. Eighty-three users signed up and completed at least one session. The average completion rate was 3 out of 4 sessions. Inuka was deemed feasible and acceptable in the local context, with connectivity challenges, app instability, expensive mobile data, and power outages cited as potential barriers to scale up. Generally, there was a decline in CMDs (F2,73 = 2.63; P = .08), depression (F2,73 = 7.67; P < .001), and anxiety (F2,73 = 2.95; P = .06) and a corresponding increase in HRQoL (F2,73 = 7.287; P < .001) in both groups. Conclusions: Study outcomes showed that it is feasible to run a future large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) and lend support to the feasibility and acceptability of Inuka, including evidence of preliminary effectiveness. The app's double anonymity and structured support were the most salient features. There is a great need for iterative app updates before scaling up. Finally, a large-scale hybrid RCT with a longer follow-up to evaluate the clinical implementation and cost-effectiveness of the app is needed.

N2  - Background: Brief interventions such as mental health apps and single-session interventions are increasingly popular, efficacious, and accessible delivery formats that may be beneficial for college students whose mental health needs may not be adequately met by college counseling centers. However, no studies so far have examined the effectiveness of these modes of treatment for college students who are already receiving traditional therapy, despite it being common among this population. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the differences in self-reported momentary negative affect between college students in therapy and not in therapy who received a brief single-session intervention delivered by counseling center staff and a supplemental mobile app. Methods: Data for this study were drawn from E-Manage, a brief mobile health intervention geared toward college students. Participants in the study were 173 college students who indicated whether they had received therapy. We conducted a multilevel model to determine whether there were differences between those in therapy versus not in therapy in negative affect reported throughout the study. Following this, we conducted multilevel models with therapy status as the predictor and negative affect as the outcome. Results: Results of the multilevel model testing showed that the cross-level interaction between the time point (ie, pre- vs postexercise) and therapy status was significant (P=.008), with the reduction in negative affect from pre- to postexercise greater for those in therapy (b=-0.65, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.40; P<.001) than it was for those not in therapy (b=-0.31, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.19; P<.001). Therapy status was unassociated with both the pre-exercise (b=-1.69, 95% CI -3.51 to 0.13; P=.07) and postexercise (b=-1.37, 95% CI -3.17 to 0.43; P=.14) ratings of negative affect. Conclusions: These findings suggest that app-based and single-session interventions are also appropriate to use among college students who are receiving traditional therapy. A randomized controlled trial comparing students receiving therapy to students receiving therapy and E-Manage will be necessary to determine to what extent E-Manage contributed to the reductions in negative affect that therapy-attending college students experienced.

N2  - Heavy drinking among people living with HIV (PLWH) reduces ART adherence and worsens health outcomes. Lengthy interventions are not feasible in most HIV care settings, and patients infrequently follow referrals to outside treatment. Utilizing visual and video features of smartphone technology, we developed HealthCall as an electronic means of increasing patient involvement in a brief intervention to reduce drinking and improve ART adherence. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of HealthCall to improve ART adherence among PLWH who drink heavily when paired with two brief interventions: the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) Clinician's Guide (CG) or Motivational Interviewing (MI). Therefore, we conducted a 1:1:1 randomized trial among 114 participants with alcohol dependence at a large urban HIV clinic. Participants were randomized to one of three groups: (1) CG only (n = 37), (2) CG and HealthCall (n = 38), or (3) MI and HealthCall (n = 39). Baseline interventions targeting drinking reduction and ART adherence were ~ 25 min, with brief (10-15 min) booster sessions at 30 and 60 days. The outcome was ART adherence assessed using unannounced phone pill-count method (possible adherence scores: 0-100%) at 30-day, 60-day, 3, 6, and 12 months. Analyses were conducted using generalized linear mixed models with pre-planned contrasts. Of the 114 enrolled patients, 58% were male, 75% identified as Black/African American, 28% were Hispanic, and 62% had less than a high school education. The mean age was 47.5 years (standard deviation [SD] 10 years) and the mean number of years since they were diagnosed with HIV was 18.6 (SD 7.6). Participants assigned to HealthCall to extend the CG had increased levels of ART adherence at 60-day and 6-month follow-up (compared to CG only), although there was no statistically significant difference by 12-month follow-up. Participants who were assigned to HealthCall to extend the MI never had statistically significant higher levels of ART adherence. These results suggest that the use of a smartphone app can be used to initially extend the reach of a brief drinking intervention to improve ART adherence over a short period of time; however, sustained long-term improvements in ART adherence after intervention activity ends remains a challenge.

N2  - Aim Patients with cancer experience various forms of psychological distress, including depressive symptoms, which can impact quality of life, elevate morbidity risk, and increase medical costs. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are effective for reducing depressive symptoms among patients with cancer, but most patients prefer psychotherapy. This study aimed to develop an efficient and effective smartphone psychotherapy component to address depressive symptom. Methods This was a decentralized, parallel-group, multicenter, open, individually randomized, fully factorial trial. Patients aged >=20 years with cancer were randomized by the presence/absence of three cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) skills (behavioral activation [BA], assertiveness training [AT], and problem-solving [PS]) on a smartphone app. All participants received psychoeducation (PE). The primary outcome was change in the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) total score between baseline and week 8. Secondary outcomes included anxiety. Results In total, 359 participants were randomized. Primary outcome data at week 8 were obtained for 355 participants (99%). The week 8 PHQ-9 total score was significantly reduced from baseline for all participants by -1.41 points (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.89, -0.92), but between-group differences in change scores were not significant (BA: -0.04, 95% CI -0.75, 0.67; AT: -0.16, 95% CI -0.87, 0.55; PS: -0.19, 95% CI -0.90, 0.52). Conclusion As the presence of any of the three intervention components did not contribute to a significant additive reduction of depressive symptoms, we cannot make evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of specific smartphone psychotherapy.

N2  - TGD individuals experience elevated levels of stress due to discrimination and oppression and, as a result, many TGD people drink alcohol to cope, resulting in elevated levels of high-risk alcohol use and disproportionate experiences of alcohol-related consequences compared to cisgender peers. TGD college students may be more likely to engage in alcohol use by virtue of typical age-related trajectories for alcohol use and risk factors associated with the college environment, including marginalization. However, there is an absence of extant brief alcohol interventions that serve TGD college students in an affirming way. One type of brief alcohol intervention, a personalized feedback intervention, may be best suited to meeting the needs of TGD college students because they reduce barriers associated with fearing negative interactions with healthcare or counseling personnel. Personalized feedback interventions utilize modules that gather and present different data about a student's alcohol use and related risk factors, as well as presenting psychoeducation to support use of skills to reduce the likelihood of experiencing alcohol-related harms. To increase the likelihood that new intervention materials will be utilized by TGD college students, it is critical to seek feedback from stakeholders on the acceptability and appropriateness of these materials during the development process. This dissertation utilized a community-based research approach to first develop three novel PFI modules addressing marginalization stress, drinking alcohol to cope, and fostering resilience, and then assess the relative acceptability and appropriateness of the modules from the perspective of TGD college students. Acceptability and appropriateness were assessed first through focus group and interview discussions with TGD college student stakeholder consultants and next through an online survey of TGD college students from across the United States. A framework analysis of participants' qualitative responses yielded three main themes: relevance of the material in each module (e.g., topics that were most useful to participants), affirming aspects of the material in each module (e.g., the use of correct pronouns and gender-neutral language), and requests for improvements in the material in each module (e.g., edits to module conciseness and organization). Overall, TGD stakeholders supported the preliminary acceptability and appropriateness of the novel modules, setting the stage for a possible feasibility pilot of the modules as part of a larger, integrated personalized feedback intervention.

N2  - Background: Digital interventions are increasingly used to support smoking cessation. Ex-smokers iCoach was a widely available app for smoking cessation used by 404,551 European smokers between June 15, 2011, and June 21, 2013. This provides a unique opportunity to investigate the uptake of a freely available digital smoking cessation intervention and its effects on smoking-related outcomes. Objective: We aimed to investigate whether there were distinct trajectories of iCoach use, examine which baseline characteristics were associated with user groups (based on the intensity of use), and assess if and how these groups were associated with smoking-related outcomes. Methods: Analyses were performed using data from iCoach users registered between June 15, 2011, and June 21, 2013. Smoking-related data were collected at baseline and every 3 months thereafter, with a maximum of 8 follow-ups. First, group-based modeling was applied to detect distinct trajectories of app use. This was performed in a subset of steady users who had completed at least 1 follow-up measurement. Second, ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the baseline characteristics that were associated with user group membership. Finally, generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between the user groups and smoking status, quitting stage, and self-efficacy over time. Results: Of the 311,567 iCoach users, a subset of 26,785 (8.6%) steady iCoach users were identified and categorized into 4 distinct user groups: low (n = 17,422, 65.04%), mild (n = 4088, 15.26%), moderate (n = 4415, 16.48%), and intensive (n = 860, 3.21%) users. Older users and users who found it important to quit smoking had higher odds of more intensive app use, whereas men, employed users, heavy smokers, and users with higher self-efficacy scores had lower odds of more intensive app use. User groups were significantly associated with subsequent smoking status, quitting stage, and self-efficacy over time. For all groups, over time, the probability of being a smoker decreased, whereas the probability of being in an improved quitting stage increased, as did the self-efficacy to quit smoking. For all outcomes, the greatest change was observed between baseline and the first follow-up at 3 months. In the intensive user group, the greatest change was seen between baseline and the 9-month follow-up, with the observed change declining gradually in moderate, mild, and low users. Conclusions: In the subset of steady iCoach users, more intensive app use was associated with higher smoking cessation rates, increased quitting stage, and higher self-efficacy to quit smoking over time. These users seemed to benefit most from the app in the first 3 months of use. Women and older users were more likely to use the app more intensively. Additionally, users who found quitting difficult used the iCoach app more intensively and grew more confident in their ability to quit over time.

N2  - Introduction Help-seeking regarding sexual health issues is low among women despite its high prevalence. The present study aims to investigate the effect of a mobile app-based psychosexual intervention on enhancing help-seeking behavior of newly married women in Iran, Rasht, regarding their sexual health issues. Methods This study was a parallel randomized controlled trial, performed during December 25, 2021, to January 12, 2022, on 140 newly married women in Iran, Rasht. Data collection tools included a demographic data questionnaire, General Help-Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ), Actual Help-Seeking Questionnaire (AHSQ), and the female sexual function index-short form (FSFI-6). The intervention group received psychosexual intervention using a mobile app, the HISSS App, while the control group received an unrelated intervention regarding menstruation hygiene using the Easy Period App. The intervention lasted 6 weeks, and the outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately after, and 8 weeks after the intervention. Results A total of 119 participants successfully completed the study. The mean differences between groups for GHSQ and formal AHSQ immediately after the intervention were significant (10.49 [95% CI (8.33 to 12.65)], P < .001; (.57 [95% CI (.23 to .69)], P < .001). They remained significant after 8 weeks as well (11 [95% CI (8.02 to 13.99)], P < .001); (.69 [95% CI (.23 to 1.15)], P = .003) when compared to baseline. However, the between groups mean that differences of informal AHSQ and FSFI-6 were only significant immediately after the intervention (.52, [95% CI (.14, .90)], P = .007); (2.93 [95% CI (2.04, 3.82)], P < .001) and not after 8 weeks. Conclusions Based on the results of the present study, a mobile app-based psychosexual intervention can enhance help-seeking behavior regarding sexual health issues among women in a short time.Policy ImplicationsIt is recommended that public health policies prioritize community-based interventions to boost the accessibility and effectiveness of both informal and formal help-seeking sources.

N2  - Many individuals in need of mental health services do not currently receive care. Scalable programs are needed to reduce the burden of mental illness among those without access to existing providers. Digital interventions present an avenue for increasing the reach of mental health services. These interventions often rely on paraprofessionals, or coaches, to support the treatment. Although existing programs hold immense promise, providers must ensure that treatments are delivered with high fidelity and adherence to the treatment model. In this paper, we first highlight the tension between the scalability and fidelity of mental health services. We then describe the design and implementation of a peer-to-peer coach training program to support a digital mental health intervention for undergraduate students within a university setting. We specifically note strategies for emphasizing fidelity within our scalable framework, including principles of learning theory and competency-based supervision. Finally, we discuss future applications of this work, including the potential adaptability of our model for use within other contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction Novel, scalable, low-cost interventions are needed to reduce harmful drinking amongst middle-older adults. Approach bias modification (ApBM) is a promising form of cognitive training for preventing/reducing alcohol use that can be delivered via smartphone. This study explored the acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of smartphone delivered and personalised ApBM amongst Australians >=55 years, an age cohort at risk of alcohol-related harms. Methods Secondary analyses in a middle-older adult subsample (>=55 years, n = 289) of an open-label pilot study using a retrospective, repeated measures design. We explored acceptability (adherence, user mobile acceptability ratings, free-text responses) and preliminary effectiveness (changes in drinking quantity and frequency, craving, dependence and proportion drinking within government-recommended guidelines) of two sessions/week over 4 weeks of evidence-based ApBM training, adapted to include personalisation and smartphone delivery amongst Australians >=55 years. Results Although minor adaptations to training were suggested, the intervention was acceptable amongst survey completers, with 72% training adherence. Relative to baseline, there was a significant increase in the proportion of drinking within recommended single-session and weekly guidelines post-training (from 25% to 41% and 6% to 28%, respectively, p < 0.001), with past-week standard drinks significantly decreasing by 18% (p < 0.001) and significant reductions in drinking days, mean craving and dependence scores (p < 0.001). Discussion and Conclusions Findings suggest smartphone ApBM is acceptable amongst middle-to-older aged Australians and may support this 'at risk' cohort to remain within government-recommended alcohol consumption guidelines to optimise healthy aging, although, in the context of a single-arm study, preliminary results should be interpreted cautiously.

N2  - Social anxiety disorder is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders. There is a need to develop brief, virtual, single-session interventions targeting constructs associated with social anxiety, such as anxiety sensitivity social concerns (ASSC). ASSC is the maladaptive belief about consequences arising from observable symptoms of anxious arousal. This study was designed to evaluate the initial acceptability and feasibility of a brief ASSC reduction program (Brief Observable Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment [BOAST]) which included a single clinician-led intervention session followed by a two-week ecological momentary intervention (EMI), delivered via mobile app. Participants (N = 36) were adults with elevated ASSC who were randomly assigned to receive BOAST (n = 19) or a waitlist control (n = 17). The trial was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04859790). Results supported the acceptability of BOAST with mixed findings for feasibility. Feasibility metrics for the EMI component were below pre-defined thresholds; however, there was evidence that homework completion was associated with symptom reduction. Preliminary efficacy metrics indicated that participants in the BOAST condition had large reductions in ASSC and one measure of social anxiety at 1-month follow-up. This study provides preliminary support for the acceptability of BOAST and elucidates avenues for future clinical and research efforts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In response to the opioid epidemic and high rates of chronic pain among the veteran population, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs implemented the TelePain-Empower Veterans Program (EVP), a nonpharmacological pain management program for veterans. Delivered virtually, TelePain-EVP incorporates integrated health components (Whole Health, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Mindful Movement) through interdisciplinary personalized coaching. The objective of this quality improvement project was to evaluate the implementation of TelePain-EVP to identify determinants to implementation, benefits and challenges to participation, and recommendations for future direction. We used a qualitative descriptive design to conduct semistructured telephone interviews with TelePain-EVP leaders (n = 3), staff (n = 10), and veterans (n = 22). The interview guides aligned with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Thematic content analysis organized and characterized findings. Several CFIR domains emerged as determinants relevant to program implementation, including innovation (eg, design); individuals (eg, deliverers, recipients); inner (eg, communications) and outer settings (eg, local conditions); and implementation process (eg, reflecting and evaluating). Identified determinants included facilitators (eg, virtual delivery) and barriers (eg, staff shortages). Participants reported improvements in pain management coping skills, interpersonal relationships, and sense of community, but no self-reported reductions in pain or medication use. Program improvement recommendations included using centralized staff to address vacancies, collecting electronic data, offering structured training, and providing course materials to veteran participants. Qualitative data can inform the sustained implementation of TelePain-EVP and other similar telehealth pain management programs. These descriptive data should be triangulated with quantitative data to objectively assess participant TelePain-EVP outcomes and associated participant characteristics. PERSPECTIVE: A qualitative evaluation of a telehealth program to manage chronic pain, guided by the CFIR framework, identified determinants of program implementation. Additionally, participants reported improvements in pain management coping skills, interpersonal relationships, and sense of community, but no self-reported reductions in pain or medication use.

N2  - Objective Digital mental health services (DMHS) overcome many barriers to help-seeking. Yet, people's use and uptake of treatment with DMHSs varies considerably. This study explored service user perspectives on deciding to take up online assessment and treatment for anxiety and/or depression within a large national DMHS. Method Participants were 20 adults who had self-referred or were referred by a GP to an Australia-wide DMHS for psychological assessment (group 1), plus follow-up discussion of treatment/other service options with a therapist (group 2), plus enrolment into internet-delivered treatment with optional therapist guidance (group 3). Participants took part in one-to-one semi-structured interviews, with parallel question guides tailored to their group status. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using framework methods. Results Analyses yielded three interlinking themes. Theme 1 highlighted the "importance of the broader treatment context, and its interaction with DHMS"; Theme 2 drew attention to "how the internal service structure shapes decision-making"; Theme 3 focussed on "the scope and limitations of DMHS". Conclusion Findings provide in-depth insights into service user decision-making around engagement with DMHS and can inform the development of interventions to support users to take up DMHS offerings that are best suited to their needs, preferences, and current circumstances. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) Key points What is already known about this topic: Digital mental health services (DMHSs) bypass many of the barriers to treatment-seeking DMHS users vary in how and the extent to which they engage with digital treatments. There is limited understanding of factors influencing user decisions to uptake and engage with DMHS. What this topic adds: Service user attitudes and experiences, the DMHS's internal structure and service delivery model, and the broader treatment landscape including external health professionals, all appear to shape user decision-making. Identified themes align with constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Framework, namely intervention characteristics; outer setting; inner setting;and characteristics of individuals. Consistent with models of shared decision-making, service users value the role of therapists in supporting active and informed decision-making around uptake and engagement with the DMHS.

N2  - Depression is a chronic and debilitating mental disorder. Despite the existence of several evidence-based treatments, many individuals suffering from depression face myriad structural barriers to accessing timely care which may be alleviated by digital mental health interventions (DMHI). Accordingly, this randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04738084) investigated the efficacy of a newer version of the therapist-supported and guided DMHI, the Meru Health Program (MHP), which was recently enhanced with heart rate variability biofeedback and lengthened from 8- to 12-weeks duration, among people with elevated depression symptoms (N = 100, mean age 37). Recruited participants were randomized to the MHP (n = 54) or a waitlist control (n = 46) condition for 12 weeks. The MHP group had greater decreases in depression symptoms compared to the waitlist control (d = -0.8). A larger proportion of participants in the MHP group reported a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in depression symptoms than participants in the waitlist control group (39.1 % vs. 9.8 %, chi2(1) = 9.90, p = .002). Similar effects were demonstrated for anxiety symptoms, quality of life, insomnia, and resilience. The results confirm the utility of the enhanced MHP in reducing depression symptoms and associated health burdens. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - To widen treatment access for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in resource-constrained South Africa, we evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a counsellor-supported PTSD Coach mobile application (app) (PTSD Coach-CS) intervention on PTSD and associated sequelae in a community sample. Participants (female = 89%; black = 77%; aged 19-61) with PTSD were randomised to PTSD Coach-CS (n = 32) or enhanced Treatment-as-Usual (n = 30), and assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items, at pre- to post-treatment and follow-up (1 and 3 months). We also collected data on user experiences of the PTSD Coach app with self-administered surveys. We conducted an intent-to-treat analysis and linear mixed models. A significant (group x time) effect for the CAPS-5 (F3.136 = 3.33, p = 0.02) indicated a greater reduction in PTSD symptom severity over time for the intervention group with a significant between-group effect size detected at 3-month follow-up. Significant between-group effect sizes were detected in self-reported stress symptom reduction in the intervention group at post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. Participants perceived the app as helpful and were satisfied with the app. Findings suggest PTSD Coach-CS as a suitable low-cost intervention and potential treatment alternative for adults with PTSD in a resource-constrained country. Replication in larger samples is needed to fully support effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Gamification in smoking cessation apps has been found to improve cognitive outcomes associated with higher odds of quitting. Although some research has shown that gamification can also positively impact behavioral outcomes such as smoking cessation, studies have largely focused on physical activity and mental health. Only a few studies have explored the effects of gamification on smoking cessation outcomes, of which the majority have adopted qualitative methodologies and/or assessed engagement with apps using self-report. Objective: This study aimed to explore levels of user engagement with gamification features in a smoking cessation app via in-app metrics. Specifically, the objective of this paper was to investigate whether higher engagement with gamification features is associated with the likelihood of quitting in the short term. Methods: Data from a larger online study that recruited smokers seeking to quit were analyzed to address the objectives presented in this paper. The study took place between June 2019 and July 2020, and participants were primarily recruited via social media posts. Participants who met the eligibility criteria used 1 of 2 mobile apps for smoking cessation. In-app metrics shared by the developer of one of the smoking cessation apps, called Kwit, were used to assess engagement with gamification features. Out of 58 participants who used the Kwit app, 14 were excluded due to missing data or low engagement with the app (ie, not opening the app once a week). For the remaining 44 participants, mean (SD) values were calculated for engagement with the app using in-app metrics. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between engagement with gamification and 7-day smoking abstinence. Results: In total, data from 44 participants who used the Kwit app were analyzed. The majority of participants were male, married, and employed. Almost 30% (n = 13) of participants self-reported successful 7-day abstinence at the end of the study. On average, the Kwit app was opened almost 31 (SD 39) times during the 4-week study period, with the diary feature used the most often (mean 22.8, SD 49.3). Moreover, it was found that each additional level unlocked was associated with approximately 22% higher odds of achieving 7-day abstinence after controlling for other factors such as age and gender (odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47). Conclusions: This study highlights the likely positive effects of certain gamification elements such as levels and achievements on short-term smoking abstinence. Although more robust research with a larger sample size is needed, this research highlights the important role that gamification features integrated into mobile apps can play in facilitating and supporting health behavior change.

N2  - Objectives To examine baseline factors (i.e., age, gender, mobile device proficiency, sensory impairment) associated with app engagement in a 12-week mental health app intervention and to explore whether app engagement predicts changes in depression and anxiety symptoms among middle-aged and older adults. Method Mobile device proficiency, sensory impairment, depression, and anxiety symptoms were measured using questionnaires. App engagement was defined by metrics characterizing the core intervention features (i.e., messages sent to therapist, mindfulness meditation minutes, action tasks completed). Multiple regressions and multilevel models were conducted. Results Forty-nine participants (M age = 57.40, SD = 11.09 years) enrolled. Women (beta = .35, p < .05) and participants with less sensory impairment completed more action tasks (beta = -.40, p < .05). Depressive and anxiety symptoms measured within the app declined significantly across treatment. Clinical significant improvements were observed for depression in 48.9% and for anxiety in 40% of participants. App engagement metrics were not predictive of depression or anxiety symptoms, either incrementally in time-lagged models or cumulatively in hierarchical linear regression analyses. Conclusion App engagement is multifaceted; participants engaged differently by gender and ability. Participation in this digital mental health intervention reduced depression and anxiety symptoms, but these findings should be interpreted with caution as the study did not include a control condition. Our findings underscore the importance of considering individual factors that may influence use of a digital mental health intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Although empirically validated for fibromyalgia (FM), cognitive and behavioral therapies, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), are inaccessible to many patients. A self-guided, smartphone-based ACT program would significantly improve accessibility. The SMART-FM study assessed the feasibility of conducting a predominantly virtual clinical trial in an FM population in addition to evaluating preliminary evidence for the safety and efficacy of a digital ACT program for FM (FM-ACT). Sixty-seven patients with FM were randomized to 12 weeks of FM-ACT (n = 39) or digital symptom tracking (FM-ST; n = 28). The study population was 98.5% female, with an average age of 53 years and an average baseline FM symptom severity score of 8 out of 11. Endpoints included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQ-R) and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). The between-arm effect size for the change from baseline to Week 12 in FIQ-R total scores was d = 0.44 (least-squares mean difference, - 5.7; SE, 3.16; 95% CI, - 11.9 to 0.6; P = .074). At Week 12, 73.0% of FM-ACT participants reported improvement on the PGIC versus 22.2% of FM-ST participants (P < .001). FM-ACT demonstrated improved outcomes compared to FM-ST, with high engagement and low attrition in both arms. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Understanding parent support for physical activity and motor skill development during early childhood.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Physical activity (PA) during early childhood is associated with physical, cognitive and mental health benefits and is predictive of PA across the lifespan. The development of fundamental movement skills (FMS) in the early years provides the foundation for lifelong PA participation. In the early years, parents are among the most influential to a child's development and help shape their learning and behaviours. A better understanding of how parents support children's PA and FMS is necessary to help address the declining rates of PA and FMS among young children. This doctoral research program consisted of three independent and complimentary studies. Study 1 was a feasibility study that examined parents' (n=20) usage and perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of an online parent-mediated physical literacy intervention for preschool-aged children. The findings from this study suggested that while online approaches may be a feasible way to engage parents of young children, further investigation into the theoretical determinants of parent PA and FMS support was warranted. Study 2 and 3 focused on gaining an in-depth understanding of the role of parents for supporting PA and FMS in early childhood. In Study 2, moderation analyses were used to examine the relationship between parent support, child PA and motor skills among 589 children aged four to five years old. Parent support had a significant, positive relationship with motor skills among children who engaged in relatively low levels of PA (B=5.96, p=0.004). Similarly, parent support had a positive relationship with child PA among children with relatively low (B=2.49, p=0.066) and moderate (B=0.90, p=0.372) motor skills. Study 3 sought to examine the antecedents to parent PA and FMS support using a mixed-methods study design. Positioned within the multi-process action control framework, a cross-sectional design was used to survey 124 parents of children aged three to four years on reflective (e.g., attitudes), regulatory (e.g., planning) and reflexive (e.g., habit) processes related to PA and FMS support. Follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of 20 parents to gain a more nuanced understanding of parent PA and FMS support behaviours. Survey findings demonstrated that parents' intentions and support behaviours for child PA and FMS were associated with a combination of reflective, regulatory and reflexive processes. Interview findings highlighted the ways by which parents viewed support for PA and FMS differently and the unique barriers and facilitators to PA and FMS support. The collective findings from this doctoral research program provide evidence that parent support influences child PA and FMS in the early years. Importantly, this program of research provides the practical and theoretical foundations that can be used to inform future development and testing of parent PA and FMS support interventions to increase PA and FMS in young children.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Digital health interventions are increasingly being designed to support health behaviour changes. Despite the promise of digital health behaviour change interventions to improve health outcomes, there is mixed evidence on whether they are effective in doing so. One key concern is that digital health behaviour change interventions are not "effectively engaging" patient and public users. "Effective engagement" with a digital health behaviour change intervention necessitates that users "micro-engage" with the digital intervention itself (e.g., log-in and use app features) and "macro- engage" with the behaviours the intervention aims to support (e.g., complete physiotherapy exercises). This thesis explored the research question: how can design methods be optimized to support the development of digital health behaviour change interventions that aim to "effectively engage" patients and the public? Paper 1 scoped the literature to examine how digital health design teams can integrate insights from behavioural science and design thinking to develop more "effectively engaging" digital health behaviour change interventions. This paper found that design teams can follow an interdisciplinary, amalgamated approach, referred to as "Behavioural Design Thinking." Paper 2 used qualitative interviews with digital health design leaders and patient-public partners to explore how to maximize the value of patient-public co-design in the digital health behaviour change design process. This paper found that the value of patient-public co-design extends far beyond product design improvement; patient-public co-design also adds value by ensuring more appropriate implementation planning and more empowering, sustainable partnership building. Paper 3 used qualitative interviews with digital health design leaders to explore how design leaders select and use behavioural science theories, models, and frameworks (TMFs) to guide digital health behaviour change design. This paper found that there is no "magic bullet" behavioural science TMF. The selection of TMFs in digital health behaviour change design is highly nuanced and clearer guidance is needed to help design teams select and use TMFs more meticulously. Overall, this thesis provided a starting point to open the "black box" of digital health behaviour change design methods optimization. Future work is needed to create design methodological guidance that will help ensure digital health interventions are purposefully designed to support "effective engagement.".

N2  - Background: A healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity and a healthy diet, is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of chronic diseases. eHealth interventions that incorporate behavior change techniques (BCTs) and dynamic tailoring strategies could effectively support a healthy lifestyle. E-Supporter 1.0 is an eCoach designed to support physical activity and a healthy diet in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Objective: This paper aimed to describe the systematic development of E-Supporter 1.0. Methods: Our systematic design process consisted of 3 phases. The definition phase included the selection of the target group and formulation of intervention objectives, and the identification of behavioral determinants based on which BCTs were selected to apply in the intervention. In the development phase, intervention content was developed by specifying tailoring variables, intervention options, and decision rules. In the last phase, E-Supporter 1.0 integrated in the Diameter app was evaluated using a usability test in 9 people with T2D to assess intervention usage and acceptability. Results: The main intervention objectives were to stimulate light to moderate-vigorous physical activities or adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines in people with T2D. The selection of behavioral determinants was informed by the health action process approach and theories explaining behavior maintenance. BCTs were included to address relevant behavioral determinants (eg, action control, self-efficacy, and coping planning). Development of the intervention resulted in 3 types of intervention options, consisting of motivational messages, behavioral feedback, and tailor-made supportive exercises. On the basis of IF-THEN rules, intervention options could be tailored to, among others, type of behavioral goal and (barriers to) goal achievement. Data on these variables could be collected using app data, activity tracker data, and daily ecological momentary assessments. Usability testing revealed that user experiences were predominantly positive, despite some problems in the fixed delivery of content. Conclusions: The systematic development approach resulted in a theory-based and dynamically tailored eCoach. Future work should focus on expanding intervention content to other chronic diseases and lifestyle behaviors, enhancing the degree of tailoring and evaluating intervention effects on acceptability, use, and cost-effectiveness.

N2  - Self-monitoring of mood and lifestyle habits is the cornerstone of many therapies, but it is still hindered by persistent issues including inaccurate records, gaps in the monitoring, patient burden, and perceived stigma. Smartwatches have the potential to deliver enhanced self-reports, but their acceptance in clinical mental health settings is unexplored and rendered difficult by a complex theoretical landscape and need for a longitudinal perspective. We present the Mood Monitor smartwatch application for mood and lifestyle habits self-monitoring. We investigated patient acceptance of the app within a routine 8-week digital therapy. We recruited 35 patients of the UK's National Health Service and evaluated their acceptance through three online questionnaires and a post-study interview. We assessed the clinical feasibility of the Mood Monitor by comparing clinical, usage, and acceptance metrics obtained from the 35 patients with a smartwatch with those from an additional 34 patients without a smartwatch (digital treatment as usual). Findings showed that the smartwatch app was highly accepted by patients, revealed which factors facilitated and impeded this acceptance, and supported clinical feasibility. We provide guidelines for the design of self-monitoring on a smartwatch and reflect on the conduct of human-computer interaction research evaluating user acceptance of mental health technologies.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Schizophrenia presents a significant mental health challenge requiring innovative solutions for relapse prevention, self-management, and health promotion. Patients face an excess mortality gap, driven by increased rates of chronic health conditions, exacerbated in low-resource settings. Digital interventions are a promising avenue to address the multifaceted needs of individuals with schizophrenia. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from digital intervention trials for schizophrenia published from January 2020 to June 2023. Recent Findings: 23 studies were identified, encompassing smartphone applications and web-based platforms to mitigate symptom severity, prevent relapse, and promote physical health. Key developments thus far have shown reduced symptom burden, and enhanced medication adherence and physical activity engagement. Despite more than a decade of research on digital interventions, many trials in this review continued to focus on acceptability and feasibility, with emphasis on patient uptake. This suggests the field has shown limited advancement in effectiveness studies of digital interventions. Summary: As the field evolves, further fully powered effectiveness studies, greater emphasis on implementation studies for digital tools for schizophrenia, and attention on digital health equity and evidence generation among those in lower-income countries are warranted. These findings hold implications for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers towards optimizing digital care for individuals with schizophrenia.

N2  - Given the limited effectiveness of conventional treatments for children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorders and conduct disorders, a supplement to conventional social skills training (SST) is needed. Digital health interventions (DHI) such as computer programs, smartphone applications, or virtual reality are likely to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional SST and may make treatments more stimulating for young people. Moreover, DHI may help to target specific problems in therapy sessions and to implement therapeutic tasks into everyday life. Reviews and meta-analyses of empirical studies on the efficacy of DHI in children and adolescents with mental disorders have provided hints on their therapeutic potential. Initial small-scale and pilot studies suggest that digital facilitations may improve conventional SST, including the assessment of social skills in children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorders and conduct disorders.

N2  - Why is psychiatry unable to define clinically useful biomarkers? We explore this question from the vantage of data and decision science and consider biomarkers as a form of phenotypic data that resolves a well-defined clinical decision. We introduce a framework that systematizes different forms of phenotypic data and further introduce the concept of decision model to describe the strategies a clinician uses to seek out, combine, and act on clinical data. Though many medical specialties rely on quantitative clinical data and operationalized decision models, we observe that, in psychiatry, clinical data are gathered and used in idiosyncratic decision models that exist solely in the clinician's mind and therefore are outside empirical evaluation. This, we argue, is a fundamental reason why psychiatry is unable to define clinically useful biomarkers: because psychiatry does not currently quantify clinical data, decision models cannot be operationalized and, in the absence of an operationalized decision model, it is impossible to define how a biomarker might be of use. Here, psychiatry might benefit from digital technologies that have recently emerged specifically to quantify clinically relevant facets of human behavior. We propose that digital tools might help psychiatry in two ways: first, by quantifying data already present in the standard clinical interaction and by allowing decision models to be operationalized and evaluated; second, by testing whether new forms of data might have value within an operationalized decision model. We reference successes from other medical specialties to illustrate how quantitative data and operationalized decision models improve patient care.

N2  - Single-session, brief interventions in therapy for young people make up a large proportion of service provision, including in digital mental health settings. Current nomothetic mental health measures are not specifically designed to capture the benefit or 'change' directly related to these brief interventions. As a consequence, we set out to design an outcome measure to concretely demonstrate the value of single-session interventions. The Session Wants and Needs Outcome Measure (SWAN-OM) aims to capture in-session goals and focuses on being user-centric, elements critical to the success of single-session and brief interventions which typically are asset-based and solution-focused. We describe the 4-stage process that was followed to develop this measure: (I) classical item generation and development, (II) content and (III) face validity pilot testing, and (IV) a user-experience approach with young people using framework analysis. This final stage was critical to ensure the integration of this outcome tool into a web-based digital therapy setting, a context which adds another layer of design complexity to item and measure development. This iterative methodology was used to overcome the challenges encountered and to place the needs of the young people and service practitioners at the centre of the design process, thus ensuring measure usability. To end, we highlight the main lessons learnt from engaging in this design process. Specifically, the needs of a measure for single-session interventions are considered, before outlining the learning associated with integrating the measure into a digital mental health platform. Both of these areas are emerging fields and, as such, this study contributes to our understanding of how an idiographic patient outcome theory driven measure can be created for use in a web-based digital mental health therapy service.

N2  - The use of mHealth to address modifiable health risk factors has increased exponentially in recent years. This chapter focuses on how mHealth has been used to intervene in substance use disorders and insomnia, with a specific focus on short messaging service (SMS) interventions, smartphone applications, and sensor-based technology. Brief descriptions of mHealth interventions for physical activity, medication management, and glucose monitoring are also provided. Recommendations for future research are provided throughout, and the chapter concludes by emphasizing the need for continued technological advancement, new conceptual models of behavior change, large-scale randomized controlled trials, interdisciplinary collaborations, and innovative funding opportunities.

N2  - The possibilities mobile sensing opens up for the social, behavioral, biomedical, and life sciences appear almost infinite and are bound to become even more comprehensive in the years to come. However, data collection with new information technology also poses new challenges for research and applied fields. Is everything that is possible also legally allowed? What are the personal and societal consequences of the possible deep insights into very private areas of life for research ethics and the relations between the researchers and those being researched? How can data be stored so that anonymity and privacy are preserved? How can quality criteria be formulated for this new and rapidly developing field of research? And how can we ensure that information and predictions derived from mobile sensing are psychometrically accurate and practically useful as we move from scientific proof-of-concept measurements to medical/clinical measurements that aim at supporting and improving the diagnostic process? To find answers to these questions, the German Data Forum, an independent council that advises the German federal government and the federal states with respect to the research data infrastructure for the empirical social, behavioral, and economic sciences, established a working group of experts in which four of the five editors of this handbook participated. Over the course of the council's activity, the need for a comprehensive handbook that would allow students, researchers, and users of mobile sensing methods to obtain comprehensive and state-of the-art information about the many opportunities, promises, challenges, and limitations that characterize this new area of social and behavioral sciences became apparent. This handbook is intended to fill this gap. It is based on the conviction that a profound understanding and the sound application of mobile sensing methods require specific knowledge and competencies: * Knowledge of the scientific background and the key concepts * Knowledge of how to generally plan and conduct a mobile sensing study * Knowledge of the different methods of data collection with mobile sensing, in terms of both the technological know-how and the methodological how-to * Knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of mobile sensing and of best practice examples from different areas of application. In order to turn this handbook idea into reality, the original group of initiators not only succeeded in inviting another highly renowned colleague as coeditor, but also managed to convince 79 leading international authors, from a range of disciplines, to participate in the handbook project and contribute their specific mobile sensing expertise in the form of a chapter. Working on the publication of this handbook, we editors have learned a great deal about methods and applications of mobile sensing from the chapters provided by the authors, and we are convinced that readers will as well.

N2  - Summary The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of digital therapeutic application of Sleep Index-Based Treatment for Insomnia (dSIBT-I) and compare them with those of digital application of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (dCBT-I). This randomised prospective pilot study was conducted at the Asan Medical Center. A total of 50 patients with insomnia were recruited between December 2022 and January 2023 and randomly allocated to the dSIBT-I or dCBT-I group. The study was carried out for one month. The primary outcome was the significant reduction in Insomnia Severity Index score at Week 4 compared to baseline, while the secondary outcome was proportion of participants whose Insomnia Severity Index scores were reduced to <15 at Week 4. We performed linear mixed model and generalised estimating equation analyses. Both dSIBT-I and dCBT-I groups showed significant improvements in Insomnia Severity Index scores at Week 4. There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of Insomnia Severity Index scores at Week 4 (group x time effect, F = 1.07, p = 0.382) and proportion of participants whose Insomnia Severity Index scores were reduced to <15 at Week 4 (group x time effects, F = 1.80, p = 0.615). However, at Week 2, the dSIBT-I group showed better results than the dCBT-I group in terms of both Insomnia Severity Index scores (p = 0.044) and proportion of participants whose Insomnia Severity Index scores were reduced to <15 (82.6% vs. 48.0%, p = 0.017). No treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in either group. The dSIBT-I is a safe and effective therapy for insomnia, with rapid treatment effects.

N2  - This study describes the online adaptation of a Positive Psychology intervention for health promotion. The methodological guidelines used were The Formative Method for Adapting Psychotherapy and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation, based on: characteristics of the intervention; of the individuals; internal and external contexts; implementation process. The intervention consisted of 6 online group sessions, with 10 staff members from the health management team of a retiree association in RS/Brazil, mean age 43.6 years (SD = 15.86). An evaluation questionnaire was completed at the end of the activities and descriptive statistics revealed participants' satisfaction with the intervention and with the moderator, as well as generalization of the contents. Changes were suggested specially to increase the duration of the sessions. We suggest the systematization the processes used in this study to support research on the implementation and adaptation of online interventions for different contexts and populations.

N2  - Anxiety sensitivity (AS), defined as the fear of anxious arousal, is a promising therapeutic target to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom development after trauma exposure. Computerized AS interventions have been shown to be acceptable to individuals with PTSD symptoms and effective in achieving symptom reduction; however, to our knowledge, no research has examined AS interventions initiated in the immediate aftermath of trauma. We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of a brief (i.e., ~75 min of psychoeducation, ~2 hr of ecological momentary intervention) smartphone-based AS intervention in a pilot study. Participants were 12 women who presented for emergency care after sexual assault with high levels of peritraumatic PTSD symptoms. Most women who started the intervention completed the majority of it and reported using the techniques provided. Results indicated that participants perceived the intervention as logical and believed it would help in reducing their symptoms. Qualitative feedback was mostly positive but also indicated concern regarding intervention length. Although not the purpose of the study, results indicated medium-to-large, statistically significant decreases in AS, g = 0.74, and PTSD symptoms, g = 1.20. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that this novel smartphone-based intervention targeting AS was feasible, acceptable, and credible in this small sample of women receiving emergency care following sexual assault. Treatment outcome data must be considered in the context of natural recovery; however, these promising preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and credibility data support continuing to pilot the feasibility and potential efficacy of the intervention to reduce AS and prolonged PTSD symptoms.

N2  - Purpose: Risk assessment is a fundamental part of clinical practice in mental health and learning disability services in the UK. Most services use a tool or framework to structure their clinical judgments, but there does not appear to be a consensus on which risk assessment tool should be used. This paper aims to describe the development, implementation and evaluation of an evidence-based formulation informed risk management (FIRM) framework in mental health and LD services. Design/methodology/approach: The development of FIRM and evaluation was based on the model for improvement, with an emphasis on co-production broken down into three distinct yet interdependent phases of co-production: co-design, co-create and co-deliver. Following the implementation of the FIRM framework, a post-implementation survey was distributed to a sample of clinical staff to capture experiences in the first three months post-implementation. Findings: The three co-production stages were pivotal for successful implementation in clinical practice. The key ingredients for success seemed to be acknowledging human factors and varied responses to change, communication, engagement and involvement of stakeholders. Early evaluation post-implementation demonstrated the benefits in terms of confidence in use, formulation of risk, risk management and communication. Further quality improvement initiatives are underway to evaluate impact up to 12 months post-implementation and to improve the quality of FIRM in practice. Future research is planned to look at enhancing personalised risk assessment and management. Originality/value: This paper describes and demonstrates the value of co-production with clinicians and stakeholders in service development. The FIRM has improved the clinical practice of risk assessment, formulation and management and use of digital technology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - While multiple studies suggest that social skills are considered as essential in promoting employment, literature highlights a deficit in these skills among workers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) for whom difficulties in communication and social interaction are often reported. In this article, we explain how we used a User-Centered Design to identify and define in detail the work-related social skills that need to be trained. The aim was to develop social scenarios to train work-related social skills relevant for people with ASD using a digital app on a tablet. Participatory Design in our study included a needs analysis with questionnaires and interviews, as well as focus-groups and workshops with professionals of several disability employment services and workers or job seekers with ASD. Sixty-six social scenarios were written and 28 social skills were identified as relevant. This approach allowed us to design a tablet-based intervention which is an intelligent system by design since its content and structure target the social skills which require training for users with ASD.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a digital patient support (DPS) tool, complementary to standard care on continuous or automatic positive airway pressure (auto)CPAP adherence and daytime sleepiness after 12 weeks in patients diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). All patients with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 30 per hour were prospectively included and randomized to receive standard care (SC) or standard care with personalized DPS via a mobile app prototype version (SC + DPS). Patients in the SC + DPS arm received additionally automated feedback on their therapy, motivational messages and therapy recommendations. 100 patients completed the study (SC: 50, SC + DPS: 50). No differences were found in characteristics of SC vs. SC + DPS (mean +/- SD) for age (53.9 +/- 10.8 vs. 51.7 +/- 12.3 years), initial diagnostic apnea-hypopnea index (51.1 +/- 15.5 vs. 50.9 +/- 17.7 events/h), BMI (33.8 +/- 6.7 vs. 33.5 +/- 4.5 kg/m), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) baseline score (9.5 +/- 4.2 vs. 9.1 +/- 5.2). After 12 weeks, mean ESS score was significantly lower (SC: 7.6 +/- 4.1 vs. SC + DPS: 5.5 +/- 3.9; p = 0.006) in the SC + DPS group vs. standard care group. Therapy adherence was significantly higher (SC: 268.7 +/- 122.1 vs. SC + DPS: 338.8 +/- 106.8 min; p = 0.002) in the SC + DPS group compared to standard care group. No difference was found in the residual AHI between both groups. However, SC + DPS group showed a trend towards fewer phases with increased leakage compared to SC group. Intention-to-treat analysis (112 (56/56) patients) showed similar results. After 12 weeks, (auto)CPAP adherence and daytime sleepiness improved significantly in patients with severe OSA using the digital patient support tool.

N2  - Purpose: Placebo terminology and their applications are well embedded in clinical and research contexts. This review seeks to clarify the principles of good placebo control design and to offer recommendations for improving placebos in digital mental healthcare. Recent Findings: Terminological confusions associated with understanding the function of placebos in pharmacology and psychotherapy reveal an underappreciation of the challenges associated with designing adequate placebo controls in clinical trials. It would be surprising if similar challenges did not arise with the testing of digital therapeutics, and emerging evidence shows an attendant lack of placebo literacy in digital health. Summary: Despite the burgeoning health app economy with tens of thousands of apps now available to download by consumers, few researchers have interrogated what constitutes a good placebo control in digital healthcare. This review sought to disambiguate placebo concepts and to offer recommendations for improving placebo design to advance and future proof the field digital therapeutics.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Objective: Digital interventions may serve as an opportune modality for improving physical activity. However, their lack of empirical decision points is an evidence gap in the optimization of digital physical activity interventions. Given that adolescents are most likely to complete their exercise between the hours of 5pm-8pm, digital prompts could occur before or during this time to maximize engagement with the intervention and exercise. The current study experimentally manipulated the timing of a digital physical activity intervention to understand the effects of intervention timing on exercise attainment. Methods: Ten adolescents completed a seven-day baseline monitoring period and TAGS, a 20- day temporally-augmented digital intervention. These participants were matched to participants who previously completed a 20-day non-temporally tailored digital intervention (NUDGE intervention; n = 10). All participants wore an accelerometer to measure their physical activity. Participants completed questionnaires about their satisfaction with the TAGS intervention, perceptions regarding the usability of the TAGS intervention, and acceptability of the TAGS protocol. The investigator assessed the feasibility and acceptability of TAGS. The investigator performed multilevel models to evaluate the effect of the TAGS intervention on physical activity compared to the NUDGE. The investigator also compared pre-intervention to intervention changes in physical activity within the TAGS group. Results: The TAGS intervention was mostly feasible and acceptable. Adolescents showed adequate levels of engagement with the TAGS-specific intervention components. Preliminary efficacy data suggest no greater benefit of TAGS on physical activity compared NUDGE. Further, pre-intervention to intervention changes in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) for the TAGS group were small (approximately a two-minute change). TAGS demonstrated a small effect (d=0.37) on MVPA compared to matched attention control participants. Conclusions: The main outcome of this study is a feasible and acceptable digital physical activity intervention for adolescents with evidence of small improvement in MVPA from pre-intervention to intervention as well as greater levels of MVPA compared to matched attention control participants. TAGS shows promise for future trials with additional refinements given participants' engagement with the system and the MVPA improvements relative to its minimalistic structure. Further optimization of TAGS will prepare the intervention for additional, more rigorous testing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia. However, guideline care is very seldom available and most patients receive no treatment, or less effective second-line pharmacotherapy or sleep hygiene, neither of which are evidence-based for chronic insomnia. The primary challenge for CBT has been supply. There are not enough therapists to meet the enormous demand. We must accelerate clinician training, but this approach can never be sufficient, even with abbreviated, efficient therapies. Fortunately, however, the treatment landscape has also changed dramatically. Fully-automated digital CBT (dCBT) has emerged as a safe, effective, and scalable treatment delivery format. dCBT is software only, so it can be disseminated as readily and widely as sleep medication. Moreover, dCBT can be integrated into services. Just as medications can be delivered through health professionals and health systems, approved dCBT programmes can be the same. However, an ecosystem of psychologically-based care should not necessitate a medical prescription model. Our proposed stepped care framework, comprises both population health and clinical health service initiatives, enabling universal access to guideline care for insomnia. The diverse ways in which CBT may be delivered (in-person, face-to-face, using telehealth, group therapy, digitally) can operate congruently and efficiently to optimise treatment for people at all levels of complexity and need. With safe and clinically effective dCBT products now set to become established as treatments, clearly differentiated from wellness apps, there is potential to rapidly transform insomnia services and, for the first time, to deliver clinical guideline care at international scale.

N2  - Background: The treatment gap for alcohol use disorders (AUD) in India is the highest among all mental health and substance use disorders. Despite evidence of the cost effectiveness of brief interventions (BIs) for hazardous drinking, implementation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is rare due to several human resource-related barriers. This paper describes the processes and outputs of a study aimed at systematically developing a mobile phone-delivered BI to overcome such barriers. Methods: This is a mixed methods study with four steps: (1) Review of existing relevant evidence base by extracting data from studies cited in two recent, relevant and high-quality systematic reviews; (2) In-depth interviews (IDIs) with 11 national experts in addictions research and practice, and 22 hazardous drinkers; (3) Delphi survey (2 rounds) to identify components for the intervention package through consensus building; and (4) Content and intervention development workshops with a range of stakeholders to develop the intervention package. Results: The research team sourced 72 journal articles from two selected systematic reviews. Key content areas extracted from the studies included facts and statistics about health related to drinking behavior, self-reflection, goal-setting messages, motivational messages, and skills to manage risky situations. The IDIs with experts and hazardous drinkers endorsed most of these content areas as well. The Delphi survey achieved consensus on 19 content areas, which included targeted recommendations, personalized feedback and information, goal management, and coping skills. The content and intervention development workshops resulted in an intervention package delivered over 8 weeks, with the following seven themes guiding the content of the weekly messages: safe drinking/health education, alcohol reduction, drinking and risk management, drinking alternatives, situational content, urge management, and maintenance and relapse prevention. Conclusion: The research team designed this study to consider contextual factors while developing the intervention, which is important to ensure acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Interestingly, the contextually informed intervention components had several commonalities with BIs developed and tested in high-income countries.

N2  - This letter discusses whether digital phenotyping could be a possible answer to the COVID-19 challenges in psychiatry in India. People with psychiatric illness in India are particularly vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. This could be due to presence of multiple risk factors such as increased medical comorbidities, reduced access to health care services, overcrowding in psychiatric hospitals and difficulty in enforcing preventive measures in uncooperative patients. Hence, vigilance and special attention in providing care for people with psychiatric illness at times of COVID-19 is of elevated importance. COVID-19 pandemic adds hurdles to care including further reduced accessibility and mobility, irregular follow up, reduced access to usual medication, and worsening of symptoms due to added stress of COVID19 such as anxiety, obsessions and depressive symptoms. Digital phenotyping is defined as the 'moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype in situ using data from personal digital devices'. "Mobile sensing" including collecting data on activity patterns, changes in location, social interactions such as number of calls and text messages etc., keyboard interactions and voice analysis tools constitute the technology behind digital phenotyping. There is a dearth of Indian literature evaluating digital phenotyping in its population. This technology will need to be developed to suit the population, be rigorously tested and implemented with minimal risk to users. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in online gaming behaviour among college students. This study aimed to examine the impact of online self-help interventions consisting of different components within the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) framework on college students' gaming disorder and gaming frequency. Additionally, it evaluated the effectiveness of both interventions in addressing psychological distress among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. One intervention was a full ACT program, which consists of six core components, while the other intervention focused on the engaged components of ACT (specifically targeting value-based actions). The study employed a 2 conditions (Full ACT vs. Engaged ACT) x 3 times (pre-, mid- and post-program) design to examine the effectiveness of these interventions. Each intervention consisted of 10 sessions, delivered at a frequency of five sessions per week over a 2-week period for both groups. The participants in this study were enrolled in two online classes. Participants with gaming disorder scores in the top 20% were selected and assigned to either the Full group (N = 49) or the Engaged group (N = 41) for the interventions. The study assessed outcome variables, including gaming disorder, psychological flexibility, daily gaming hours, weekly gaming days and psychological distress, at pre-intervention, mid-intervention, post-intervention and one-month follow-up for both groups. No significant differences were observed between the two groups on these outcomes at the pre-intervention stage. The findings of this study indicate that both interventions effectively reduced gaming disorder and weekly gaming frequency, while enhancing psychological flexibility. Nonetheless, the Engaged group exhibited a significant reduction in daily gaming hours. There was no substantial change in psychological distress in either group during and after the intervention. The implications and limitations of this study were also reported. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Individualization of mhealth interventions for children and adolescents.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Introduction: Insufficient physical activity has been established as a significant risk factor for non-communicable diseases, increasing the risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, dementia, obesity, and breast and colon cancer. Meanwhile regular physical activity is associated with positive effects on stress management and related health risks. The benefits of physical activ-ity are particularly impactful for children and adolescents, as behavioral changes during adolescence can extend into adulthood. However, the prevalence of insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior among youth worldwide is steadily increasing, potentially due to the rise of digitalization and increased screen time. Surprisingly, longitudinal and representative data from the KIGGS study demonstrates no correlation between screen time and reduced physical activity in children. Addressing the digital realities of modern childhood and adolescents, digital health interventions (e.g., mHealth) may provide a life-relevant and motivating entry point for changing physical activity related behaviors. Numerous meta-analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of smartphone interventions among youth, although effect sizes remain low. The lack of scientific foundations of content, non-specific approaches, inadequate age-appropriateness, low individualization, and poor usability are cited as possible reasons. Thus, innovative approaches are needed to increase the effectiveness and adherence of digital health interventions among children and adolescents, involving evidence-based techniques for behavior change (e.g., gamification, goal setting), age-appropriate developmental theories, motivational aspects, and multi-level individualization. As such, this dissertation focuses on the following research questions: (1) How does individualization and age as moderators impact the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for reducing sedentary behavior in children and adolescents? (2) What are the feasible mHealth-based physical activity and health objectives that can be achieved within the family context involving early adolescents? (3) How can digital health literacy be promoted in the school setting to encourage reflective and responsible use of mHealth applications among mid-adolescents? (4) How does individualization affect the effectiveness of physical activity-based mHealth interventions? Methods: A cumulative dissertation consisting of seven pre-registered publications in national and international peer-reviewed journals was developed to address these research questions. To answer the first research question, a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis (1) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of digital health interventions for preventing insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior in children and adolescents across different developmental stages, as well as to compare individualized interventions with non-individualized interventions. To answer the next two research questions, which were based on the results of the aforementioned literature review, two mixed-methods cross-sectional studies were conducted to examine the prerequisites for digital health promotion for children and adolescents in (2) family and (3) school settings. Qualitative sub-studies were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with MAXQDA, while quantitative sub-studies were analyzed using SPSS, rStudio, and JASP. The family-focused study (2) was an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study that aimed to identify family health goals through interviews with N=60 parents and focus groups with N=120 adolescents. The subsequent quantitative sub-study surveyed N=1008 families nationwide on their interest in the identified family health goals and their health behavior.

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote patient monitoring technology, which offers exciting opportunities for expanded connected care at a distance. However, while the mode of clinicians' interactions with patients and their health data has transformed, the larger framework of how we deliver care is still driven by a model of episodic care that does not facilitate this new frontier. Fully realizing a transformation to a system of continuous connected care augmented by remote monitoring technology will require a shift in clinicians' and health systems' approach to care delivery technology and its associated data volume and complexity. In this article, we present a solution that organizes and optimizes the interaction of automated technologies with human oversight, allowing for the maximal use of data-rich tools while preserving the pieces of medical care considered uniquely human. We review implications of this "augmented continuous connected care" model of remote patient monitoring for clinical practice and offer human-centered design-informed next steps to encourage innovation around these important issues.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2021-82249-001). Background: Depressive symptoms are one of the most common and ever-increasing mental health problems among students worldwide. Conventional treatment options, particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet- and mobile-based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the treatment gap. Objective: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self-help smartphone app (MCT & More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of students with self-reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions on treatment adherence and effectiveness. Methods: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and randomized to either the intervention group (n = 200), who received access to the self-help smartphone app MCT & More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait-list control group (n = 200). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (depression) served as the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (self-esteem) and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life-abbreviated version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure attitudes toward internet- and mobile-based interventions. Outcome expectations were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy. Results: Per-protocol (PP), complete-case, and intention-to-treat analyses showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F1222 = 3.98; P = .047; d = 0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self-esteem (PP: F1220 = 8.79; P = .003; d = 0.77) in the intervention group than in the wait-list control group. Most participants regularly used the self-help smartphone app (91/120, 75.8%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward internet- and mobile-based interventions (r = 0.260; P = .004) and the more positive the outcome expectation (r = 0.236; P = .009), the more frequently the self-help smartphone app was used. Conclusions: The effectiveness of the self-help smartphone app MCT & More was demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait-list control group. The app could be offered regularly as a low-threshold intervention to enhance students' health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Strong evidence suggests that parents of children on the autism spectrum face increased stressors to their physical and mental wellbeing due to the demands of caregiving and paucity of support. The disparity between the services currently offered and unmet needs indicates that accessible and flexible support through online delivery is needed for parents. This study presents the ideas and perspectives collected from five focus groups of 17 parents of autistic children, on the optimal content and implementation strategy of an online intervention. Using thematic framework analysis, we derived themes under the categories: the need for online interventions; content and design; and implementation. Parents supported the development of a multicomponent online intervention which combines psychoeducation with peer-support and access to healthcare professionals.

N2  - Objective: Problematic anger is commonly reported among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and is associated with numerous psychosocial impairments. There is a clear need to develop innovative and effective anger interventions. One of the cognitive mechanisms associated with anger is the hostile interpretation bias, which is the tendency to interpret ambiguous interpersonal situations as hostile. The current study presents a successive cohort design methodology to develop and refine a mobile treatment application, entitled Mobile Anger Reduction Intervention (MARI), which uses interpretation bias modification techniques to modify hostile interpretation bias. Method: Two cohorts (total N = 13) of veterans with PTSD and problematic anger used the MARI application for 4 weeks. After each cohort, qualitative and quantitative data were used to modify the MARI application. The intervention is described, as well as the qualitative and quantitative findings and subsequent changes made to the mobile application based on participant feedback. Results: Treatment adherence was high (90% of participants completed all sessions). Participants reported that they found the treatment helpful and easy to use and experienced improvements in hostile interpretation bias and problematic anger. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the utility of a successive cohort treatment design for the development of mobile interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder often experience difficulty controlling their anger, which can negatively affect their lives. Many individuals with problematic anger have a tendency to think that others are behaving in a hostile way, when that it not necessarily the case. We have developed a mobile intervention (Mobile Anger Reduction Intervention [MARI]) to reduce this tendency by helping veterans make benign interpretations to various situations. This study presents data from two groups of veterans who used MARI for 4 weeks and provided feedback on their opinions about the intervention. After each group used the intervention, changes were made to its design and content. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To estimate the effects of providing access to an alcohol intervention based on a smartphone. Design: Randomised controlled trial.. Setting: Four higher education institutions in Switzerland. Participants: 1770 students (>=18 years) who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use (ie, a score on the alcohol use disorders identification test-consumption (AUDIT-C) of >=4 for men and >=3 for women) were randomly assigned by 1:1 allocation ratio in blocks of 10. Intervention: Providing access to a brief, smartphone based alcohol intervention. Outcome measures: The primary outcome studied was number of standard drinks per week at six months and the secondary outcome was number of heavy drinking days (past 30 days). Additional outcomes were maximum number of drinks consumed on one occasion, alcohol related consequences, and academic performance. Follow-up assessments occurred at months three, six, and 12. Data were analysed by intention to treat and by using generalised linear mixed models with random intercepts for the recruitment site and participants nested within the recruitment site, and with intervention (v control), time (three months v six months; 12 months v six months), and baseline outcome values as fixed effects. Results: Between 26 April 26 2021 and 30 May 2022, 1770 participants (intervention group (n=884); control group (n=886)) were included. Mean age was 22.4 years (standard deviation 3.07); 958 (54.1%) were women; and 1169 (66.0%) were undergraduate students, 533 (30.1%) were studying for a master's degree, 43 (2.4%) were studying for a doctorate, and 25 (1.4%) were students of other higher education programme. The baseline mean number of standard drinks per week was 8.59 (standard deviation 8.18); the baseline number of heavy drinking days was 3.53 (4.02). Of 1770 participants, follow-up rates were 1706 (96.4%) at three months, 1697 (95.9%) at six months, and 1660 (93.8%) at 12 months. Of 884 students randomly assigned to the intervention group, 738 (83.5%) downloaded the smartphone application. The intervention had a significant overall effect on the number of standard drinks per week (incidence rate ratio 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.96)), heavy drinking days (0.89 (0.83 to 0.96)), and the maximum number of drinks consumed on one occasion (0.96 (0.93 to 1.00), P=0.029), indicating significantly lower drinking outcomes in the intervention group than in the control group during the follow-up period. The intervention did not affect alcohol related consequences or academic performance. Conclusions: Providing access to the smartphone application throughout the 12 month follow-up was effective at limiting the average drinking volume of university students who had self-reported unhealthy alcohol use at baseline.

N2  - Background: Mental health apps offer a transformative means to increase access to scalable evidence-based care for college students. Yet low rates of engagement currently preclude the effectiveness of these apps. One promising solution is to make these apps more responsive and personalized through digital phenotyping methods able to predict symptoms and offer tailored interventions. Objective: Following our protocol and using the exact model shared in that paper, our primary aim in this study is to assess the prospective validity of mental health symptom prediction using the mindLAMP app through a replication study. We also explored secondary aims around app intervention personalization and correlations of engagement with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Digital Working Alliance Inventory scale in the context of automating the study. Methods: The study was 28 days in duration and followed the published protocol, with participants collecting digital phenotyping data and being offered optional scheduled and algorithm-recommended app interventions. Study compensation was tied to the completion of weekly surveys and was not otherwise tied to engagement or use of the app. Results: The data from 67 participants were used in this analysis. The area under the curve values for the symptom prediction model ranged from 0.58 for the UCLA Loneliness Scale to 0.71 for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Engagement with the scheduled app interventions was high, with a study mean of 73%, but few participants engaged with the optional recommended interventions. The perceived utility of the app in the TAM was higher (P=.01) among those completing at least one recommended intervention. Conclusions: Our results suggest how digital phenotyping methods can be used to create generalizable models that may help create more personalized and engaging mental health apps. Automating studies is feasible, and our results suggest targets to increase engagement in future studies. International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/37954.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Digital behavior change interventions are capable of promoting significant change in health behaviors, but often suffer high disengagement and nonusage dropout. The purpose of this dissertation was to determine if depressive symptoms or pessimistic attributional styles negatively influenced proximal engagement behaviors among users of study websites or smartphone apps. Three different interventions were assessed across the three Aims. Aim One used structural equation modeling to determine if CES-D scores were indirectly associated with 6-month weight change outcomes through mediating latent constructs for engagement and adherence among adults (N=338) in a 12-month eHealth intervention. CES-D scores were negatively associated with both engagement and adherence, which were positively associated with 6-month weight loss, contributing to a significant negative indirect effect. Additionally, CES-D scores predicted significantly higher risk of users disengaging from the website over time. Aim Two applied mixed effects modeling to estimate participants' (N=52) likelihood of viewing messages as a function of the number of goals they were currently failing in an mHealth microrandomized pilot, and a generalization of log-linear regression analysis to assess the likelihood of reading consecutive program messages following receipt of goal-discrepant messages, and if these relationships were moderated by CES-D scores, net of other covariates. The more goals participants were failing, the less likely they were to read any program messages sent. Additionally, receipt of goal discrepant messages was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of participants reading the next program message sent, compared to neutral messages or no message; however, these relationships did not appear to be influenced by CES-D scores. Aim Three compared the CES-D indicating depressive symptoms and the DAQ indicating pessimistic attributional styles for their potential to predict lower engagement following goal-discrepant feedback using mixed effects regression among a subsample of participants (N=132) in an ongoing mHealth intervention. Both scales were associated with lower odds of reading the next program message sent following receipt of goal-discrepant feedback, and higher odds of disengagement, but no effects on app page views between messages. These results provide some support for tailoring message content based on psychological indicators to reduce negative influences on program engagement.

N2  - Background: In 2020, more than 250 eHealth solutions were added to app stores each day, or 90,000 in the year; however, the vast majority of these solutions have not undergone clinical validation, their quality is unknown, and the user does not know if they are effective and safe. We sought to develop a simple prescreening scoring method that would assess the quality and clinical relevance of each app. We designed this tool with 3 health care stakeholder groups in mind: eHealth solution designers seeking to evaluate a potential competitor or their own tool, investors considering a fundraising candidate, and a hospital clinician or IT department wishing to evaluate a current or potential eHealth solution. Objective: We built and tested a novel prescreening scoring tool (the Medical Digital Solution scoring tool). The tool, which consists of 26 questions that enable the quick assessment and comparison of the clinical relevance and quality of eHealth apps, was tested on 68 eHealth solutions. Methods: The Medical Digital Solution scoring tool is based on the 2021 evaluation criteria of the French National Health Authority, the 2022 European Society of Medical Oncology recommendations, and other provided scores. We built the scoring tool with patient association and eHealth experts and submitted it to eHealth app creators, who evaluated their apps via the web-based form in January 2022. After completing the evaluation criteria, their apps obtained an overall score and 4 categories of subscores. These criteria evaluated the type of solution and domain, the solution's targeted population size, the level of clinical assessment, and information about the provider. Results: In total, 68 eHealth solutions were evaluated with the scoring tool. Oncology apps (22%, 20/90) and general health solutions (23%, 21/90) were the most represented. Of the 68 apps, 32 (47%) were involved in remote monitoring by health professionals. Regarding clinical outcomes, 5% (9/169) of the apps assessed overall survival. Randomized studies had been conducted for 21% (23/110) of the apps to assess their benefit. Of the 68 providers, 38 (56%) declared the objective of obtaining reimbursement, and 7 (18%) out of the 38 solutions seeking reimbursement were assessed as having a high probability of reimbursement. The median global score was 11.2 (range 4.7-17.4) out of 20 and the distribution of the scores followed a normal distribution pattern (Shapiro-Wilk test: P = .33). Conclusions: This multidomain prescreening scoring tool is simple, fast, and can be deployed on a large scale to initiate an assessment of the clinical relevance and quality of a clinical eHealth app. This simple tool can help a decision-maker determine which aspects of the app require further analysis and improvement.

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - The article discusses the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms, regarded as a core aspect of schizophrenia, still are an unmet treatment need. Controversial definitions and assessment methods have contributed to the poor understanding of their pathophysiology and hindered the development of targeted treatment options. The technological development allows the use of largely available devices, such as smartphones. Although there is still a digital divide among countries, the possible outreach of digital phenotyping is several times larger than that of expert assessment in clinical settings. Expressive negative symptoms have been modeled through automated speech and facial expression analysis, while experiential negative symptoms through passive data collection (e.g., geo-localization, activity levels, analysis of social interactions through social media) matched with ecological momentary assessment (EMA, consisting in repeated, prompted self-report in natural context) of internal experience. Proof-of-concept studies have flourished in the last decade, but the uptake in clinical trials or routine settings has been challenged by the modest or no association of these measures with experts' ratings of negative symptoms and by a poor trust in sustainability and security of available apps. The expectation of correlations was probably naive as the two types of measures have very different granularity, during an interview, for instance, the expressivity with the expected norms and the interview context (changes in expressivity during neutral or emotional conversation), but this is not the case with digital methods. Digital phenotyping data multiply the sampling frequency of behavior and experience in real-life contexts, but relevant normative data are not yet available. Thus, high-resolution data from healthy subjects need to be collected and integrated in the analysis. Furthermore, large studies in patients are needed to verify the acceptance and feasibility of ecological data collection. To harness the power of digital phenotyping input by multiple stakeholders is needed, as for the whole field of precision psychiatry, to improve data protection and sustainability of available apps, collect normative data, and provide validated measures of negative symptoms in real-life.

N2  - Comments on an article by Eric Achtyes et al. (see record 2024-02413-006). A recent letter published by Eric Achtyes et al. emphasizes the urgent need for establishing adequate regulatory methods for digital health products. The authors argue that big tech companies have received preferential treatment under the guise of technology exceptionalism, leading to the offering of products without sufficient guarantees of effectiveness and safety. While the authors partially agree with this point of view, they would like to provide additional context. The authors agree with Achtyes et al. that safety and efficacy should be prioritized to fully harness the immense potential offered by digital health. Nevertheless, over the last decade, regional regulatory bodies have diligently worked to keep pace with digital health advancements, which will undoubtedly require further refinement. Ideally, a joint and collaborative effort among regulators, academic and health institutions, and big-tech companies could lead to better quality and safer app store environments with a global outreach.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - This dissertation examines the relationship between the physical isolation of online graduate students and their self-efficacy, motivation, and help-seeking. The theoretical frameworks underpinning the study were Knowles's adult learning theory and Zimmerman's self-regulation theory. While there have been studies about student isolation in online classes, student self-regulation in online classes, and student engagement in online classes, there is a lack of research examining the relationship between the isolation of online students and their self-regulation. This study adds to the current body of literature by addressing that relationship. A convergent mixed-methods design was employed to answer the research questions guiding the study: 1. What is the relationship between isolation from a physical campus and student self-efficacy in online classes? 2. How is isolation from physical interaction with faculty and peers related to student motivation in online courses? 3. How are help-seeking behaviors and attitudes associated with isolation from a physical class? A 67-item electronic survey was emailed to 645 current or recently graduated students from online graduate programs offered in three medium to large universities from a single state university system. Seventy-one participants completed the survey, providing quantitative and a small amount of qualitative data, and interviews with 11 participants who self-selected from the survey completers provided the bulk of qualitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis tests, Pearson's correlation coefficient tests, linear regression analyses, and a Spearman's rho analysis. Qualitative data were analyzed using in vivo coding, descriptive coding, code mapping, and pattern coding methods. Findings indicated that physical isolation from campus is strongly mitigated if students are allowed sufficient personal agency to engage with course content at times that worked best with their schedules and learning styles, if students were provided enough peer interaction to become comfortable reaching out to one another for help, and if students were sufficiently supported by faculty who provided assignment clarifications, personalized feedback, and occasional encouragement. Implications for online instruction and design are presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Emotion processing deficits of alexithymia are a transdiagnostic risk factor. While such deficits are malleable, the differential efficacy of brief scalable digital mental trainings remains understudied. Methods: This randomized controlled trial probed the efficacy of mindfulness-based (MB) and partner-based socio-emotional Affect Dyad (SE) practice, both supported by weekly coaching sessions, in reducing alexithymia in 285 adult participants. We investigated the predictive role of interoceptive awareness assessed a) before and after daily practice, b) in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) before and after the intervention, and c) weekly during the 10-week intervention. Results: Both interventions reduced emotion processing difficulties on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Similarly, both interventions improved interoceptive awareness immediately after daily practice and after the intervention period, yet SE outperformed MB training in EMA assessments. Further, only Dyad practice led to increases in body listening and self-regulatory aspects of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) over time, with the latter explaining a decrease in alexithymia. Limitations: Given the subclinical study sample, findings are limited in their generalizability to clinical samples. Conclusions: Findings suggest that app-based socio-emotional and mindfulness-based practices, supported by online coaching sessions, are effective in reducing emotion processing deficits. Dyad training showed advantages on some measures of body awareness, which predicted observed changes in alexithymia. This highlights the potential of using app-based dyadic approaches in the development of emotion awareness and regulation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The prevalence of alcohol misuse is high among people with HIV (PWH); however, access to and utilization of evidence-based alcohol misuse interventions remain limited. Telehealth is one treatment approach with the potential for enhancing substance use disorder treatment utilization for PWH served by Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). However, questions remain regarding barriers to alcohol-focused telehealth service integration and telehealth research in FQHCs. This study employed qualitative methods, guided by the Dynamic Sustainability Framework, to evaluate barriers and cultural factors impacting FQHC telehealth integration. Eighteen qualitative interviews were completed with staff and leaders across four FQHCs. Interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis, and codes were organized into a priori and emergent themes. Key themes included the presence of common workflows for referring clients to substance use disorder treatment; existing research workflows and preferences for active project staff involvement; telehealth barriers including exacerbation of healthcare disparities and high provider turnover; and the importance of cultural humility and telehealth adaptations for sexual, gender, racial and ethnic minority clients. Findings from this study will inform the development of an alcohol-focused telehealth implementation strategy for a Hybrid Type 1 implementation effectiveness trial to enhance FQHC substance use disorder treatment.

T1  - Developing e-covery, an app-based intervention to support individuals with co-occurring problem alcohol and opioid use.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2024//
N2  - Background: Co-occurring alcohol and opioid use are an under-addressed factor associated with increased drug overdose mortality. There are many challenges in the treatment of co-occurring alcohol and opioid use with most individuals in need of substance use treatment not receiving treatment services. Those that do have a high likelihood of returning to use, with resumption of use following treatment episodes increasing risk for overdose. Contextual factors have been recognized as triggers of cravings to return to use. Few interventions work to address the effect these factors have on individuals in early recovery, with locations serving as a particularly challenging trigger. Research suggests that raising awareness of such location-based triggers can support individuals in developing coping strategies and maintaining recovery. mHealth interventions have the potential to provide real-time support to individuals in triggering locations. Following the IDEAS framework for mHealth intervention design, this dissertation uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to build the knowledge base around the challenges facing individuals engaging in co-occurring alcohol and opioid use as well as potential intervention strategies that can support them in engaging in safer use behaviors. Methods: To start, this dissertation describes the demographics and spatial relationships of opioid overdose associated with co-occurring alcohol and opioid use. In the first part of Chapter 1, social network analysis techniques were used to visualize the detection of both alcohol and opioids in opioid overdose deaths in Connecticut from 2010 through 2020 (based on data from the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner), with Chi-square analyses and Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons used to determine how combinations of alcohol and other drugs varied by demographic characteristics. The second part of Chapter 1 uses spatial analysis techniques and regression models to determine how the spatial distribution of alcohol outlets relates to alcohol detection in opioid overdose deaths in 2019 and 2020 at both the individual and ecological levels. Information about alcohol outlets was obtained from the Department of Consumer Protection while information about census tracts was obtained from the 2018 American Community Survey. Moving on to intervention development, in Chapter 2, thematic analysis was used to explore how 30 individuals in substance use treatment in Connecticut and Georgia used smartphone technology in support of their recovery as well as their attitudes towards the use of tracking technology for research and intervention purposes. In Chapter 3, another round of qualitative interviews was conducted with 31 individuals reporting co-occurring alcohol and opioid use in both Connecticut and Georgia. Thematic analysis according to Marlatt and Gordon's cognitive behavioral model was used to understand how these individuals experienced location-based triggers and how they responded to these triggers. Themes and participant quotes related to these responses informed the generation of messaging for an mHealth intervention. Finally, in Chapter 4, the first round of testing was conducted on the functional prototype of the intervention, e-Covery, in order to determine its preliminary usability, feasibility, and acceptability through both a quantitative survey and a qualitative interview at the end of a seven-day trial period among ten participants in Connecticut reporting problem levels of both alcohol and opioid use. This was supplemented by a pair of focus groups with twelve individuals who provide services to people who use substances in order to understand how the intervention can be integrated into existing treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support interventions.

N2  - Driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, many in-person health behavior interventions were compelled to quickly pivot to a virtual format with little time or capacity to reflect on or examine possible equity-related implications of a format that required digital access and remote learning skills. Using a parenting program for low-income families as a case study, this paper (a) outlines the process of adapting the program from an in-person to a virtual format and (b) examines the equity-related implications of this adaptation. Parents Connect for Healthy Living (PConnect) is a 10-session empowerment-focused parenting intervention designed to promote family health for Head Start families. In 2020, PConnect was adapted over a 6-month period from an in-person to a virtual format due to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three core elements were retained in the adaptation; session content, provision of coaching support for facilitators, and the co-facilitation model. Key modifications include session length, group composition, and language of program delivery. Head Start and PConnect records provided data to compare reach, acceptability, and appropriateness of virtual and in-person PConnect. Seventy-eight parents enrolled in the in-person program and 58 in the virtual program. Participant demographics and satisfaction were similar across formats, and demographics similar to the general Head Start population. Participation was higher in the virtual format. Parents participated in the virtual program primarily via smart phones (68%). This case study supports the acceptability and appropriateness of virtual parenting programs in ethnically diverse, low-resource settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background. People with psychotic disorders tend to die earlier than the general population, primarily due to preventable cardiovascular disease. Behavioral risk factors, such as poor diet, have been identified as major contributors. Given the importance of prevention, the early stages of psychosis have been described as a "critical" time to intervene on health behaviors. As such, a mobile-based intervention, Nutrition Enhancement in Early Psychosis (NEEP) was created to improve diet quality in persons with early psychosis. This study has three aims: (1) assess the feasibility of the intervention, (2) examine preliminary outcomes, and (3) investigate mechanisms associated with dietary change. Methods. NEEP incorporates a combination of nutrition education, goal setting, and mobile technology (i.e., a mobile application for dietary tracking, as well both automated and personalized text-messages). Given the pilot nature of the study, all participants (N=15) received the intervention. Feasibility was assessed through different metrics related to recruitment and adherence to the dietary tracking application, as well as self-report responses regarding acceptability. Preliminary outcomes (i.e., two measures of diet quality) and potential mechanisms of change (i.e., self-efficacy and motivation) were also evaluated using paired sample t-tests. Qualitative interviews were conducted following study participation. Given the emphasis on feasibility with a small sample, all significance tests were set at p <.10, and Hedges g was used to examine effects over time. Results.15 participants were enrolled in the study and 12 participants completed follow-up assessments. Evaluative measures of feasibility suggest that the majority of those who were screened enrolled in this intervention and regularly engaged with the mobile tracking device to record their dietary consumption. In addition, participants enjoyed the intervention and found it self-efficacy significantly decreased after the intervention (p=.028) and motivation remained relatively stable. Conclusion. Conclusion. Results suggest that NEEP is feasible as a low-cost, low-resource mobile intervention that is well-tolerated and may improve diet quality in people with early psychosis; however, mechanisms of change require further exploration.

N2  - Smartphones allow the automatic and continuous collection of real-time self-reported and passive objective behavioral data, which have the potential to avoid inherent biases and complement standardized mental health assessments. Bipolar disorder (BD) represents the ideal diagnostic framework for capturing digital information, as its depressive and manic phases overtly translate into altered emotion, speech, and behavior. Smartphones offer unique capabilities to detect prodromal affective symptoms between outpatient visits in BD and, therefore, potential for facilitating early interventions. Even smartphone-based interventions have shown some efficacy for depression and anxiety, their efficacy for BD is still unclear.The heterogeneity of studies assessing smartphone-based interventions in BD so far fostered the development by the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) Big Data Task Force of an expert consensus to establish how studies assessing the efficacy of smartphone-based interventions for BD should be designed and report user-engagement indicators objectively. This consensus will allow clinicians to compare and replicate studies and reach higher scientific rigor, qualitatively and quantitatively classify and rank smartphone-based interventions, and have accurate and reliable UEI to evaluate smartphone-based interventions in BD.Smartphones could provide global, cost-effective, and evidence-based mental health services on demand and in real time. However, there are still many challenges still to be addressed that need the cooperation of multiple and distinct parties involved. This chapter provides an overview of the state-of-the-art efficacy of smartphone-based interventions for BD, the current challenges, barriers, and future directions.

N2  - The digital world has been growing exponentially, changing the way we do science-both in how we generate and disseminate it. This has consequently opened up opportunities to improve mental healthcare. Mobile interventions, real-time symptom monitoring, chatbots, and digital phenotyping are among those opportunities that take mental health outside of the office, empowering patients in their own treatment. However, these approaches do not rule out the presence of mental health professionals, who not only use technology for telepsychiatry consultations, but also for more effective and data-driven diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up in the clinic. New technologies can support direct interventions with patients, the collection of data outside the office, either active or passively, and a clearer look at the data both for patients and providers with the help of data curators. To guarantee privacy, efficacy, and evaluate risks attached to the treatment provided by these apps, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) developed an evaluation model to do such assessment. This way the clinician-patient relationship can expand, providing more clinical insights to both clinicians and patients and a more empathetic look for providers at their own patients. Ethical concerns must be considered when talking about the integration of technology with mental healthcare, but its perceived advantages, such as accessibility, efficacy, and engagement, promise a new era in this important department worldwide.

N2  - This innovative book focuses on potential, limitations, and recommendations for the digital mental health landscape. Authors synthesize existing literature on the validity of digital health technologies, including smartphones apps, sensors, chatbots and telepsychiatry for mental health disorders. They also note that collecting real-time biological information is usually better than just collect filled-in forms, and that will also mitigate problems related to recall bias in clinical appointments. Limitations such as confidentiality, engagement and retention rates are moreover discussed. Presented in fifteen chapters, the work addresses the following questions: may smartphones and sensors provide more accurate information about patients' symptoms between clinical appointments, which in turn avoid recall bias? Is there evidence that digital phenotyping could help in clinical decisions in mental health? Is there scientific evidence to support the use of mobile interventions in mental health? Digital Mental Health will help clinicians and researchers, especially psychiatrists and psychologists, to define measures and to determine how to test apps or usefulness, feasibility and efficacy in order to develop a consensus about reliability. These professionals will be armed with the latest evidence as well as prepared to a new age of mental health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The number of young people in New Zealand (Aotearoa) who experience mental health challenges is increasing. As those in Aotearoa went into the initial COVID-19 lockdown, an ongoing digital mental health project was adapted and underwent rapid content authoring to create the Aroha chatbot. This dynamic digital support was designed with and for young people to help manage pandemic-related worry. Objective: Aroha was developed to provide practical evidence-based tools for anxiety management using cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. The chatbot included practical ideas to maintain social and cultural connection, and to stay active and well. Methods: Stay-at-home orders under Aotearoa's lockdown commenced on March 20, 2020. By leveraging previously developed chatbot technology and broader existing online trial infrastructure, the Aroha chatbot was launched promptly on April 7, 2020. Dissemination of the chatbot for an open trial was via a URL, and feedback on the experience of the lockdown and the experience of Aroha was gathered via online questionnaires and a focus group, and from community members. Results: In the 2 weeks following the launch of the chatbot, there were 393 registrations, and 238 users logged into the chatbot, of whom 127 were in the target age range (13-24 years). Feedback guided iterative and responsive content authoring to suit the dynamic situation and motivated engineering to dynamically detect and react to a range of conversational intents. Conclusions: The experience of the implementation of the Aroha chatbot highlights the feasibility of providing timely event-specific digital mental health support and the technology requirements for a flexible and enabling chatbot architectural framework.

N2  - Background: Patients can struggle to make good use of psychotherapy owing to deficits in awareness, and digital technologies that support awareness are at a premium. Currently, when patients participate in cognitive analytic therapy (CAT), the technology supporting relational awareness work involves completion of paper-based worksheets as between-session tasks. Objective: We aimed to design, with therapists and patients, a prototype digital mobile app. This was to help patients better engage in the "recognition" phase of the CAT treatment model by providing an unobtrusive means for practicing relational awareness with dynamic feedback on progress. Methods: A national online survey was conducted with CAT therapists (n=50) to determine readiness for adoption of a mobile app in clinical practice and to identify core content, functionality, and potential barriers to adoption. A prototype mobile app based on data and existing paper-based worksheets was built. Initial face-to-face user testing of the prototype system was completed with three therapists and three CAT expatients. Results: Among the therapists surveyed, 72% (36/50) reported not currently using any digital tools during CAT. However, the potential value of a mobile app to support patient awareness was widely endorsed. Areas of therapist concern were data security, data governance, and equality of access. These concerns were mirrored during subsequent user testing by CAT therapists. Expatients generated additional user specifications on the design, functionality, and usability of the app. Results from both streams were integrated to produce five key changes for the reiteration of the app. Conclusions: The user-centered design process has enabled a prototype CAT-App to be developed to enhance the relational awareness work of CAT. This means that patients can now practice relational awareness in a much more unobtrusive manner and with ongoing dynamic feedback of progress. Testing the acceptability and feasibility of this technological innovation in clinical practice is the next stage in the research process, which has since been conducted and has been submitted. The important challenges of data protection and governance must be navigated in order to ensure implementation and adoption if the CAT-App is found to be acceptable and clinically effective.

N2  - A starting point of many digital health interventions informed by the Stages of Change Model of behavior change is assessing a person's readiness to change. In this paper, we use the concept of readiness to develop and validate a prediction model of health-seeking behavior in the context of family planning. We conducted a secondary analysis of routinely collected, anonymized health data submitted by 4,088 female users of a free health chatbot in Kenya. We developed a prediction model of (future) self-reported action by randomly splitting the data into training and test data sets (80/20, stratified by the outcome). We further split the training data into 10 folds for cross-validating the hyperparameter tuning step in model selection. We fit nine different classification models and selected the model that maximized the area under the receiver operator curve. We then fit the selected model to the full training dataset and evaluated the performance of this model on the holdout test data. The model predicted who will visit a family planning provider in the future with high precision (0.93) and moderate recall (0.75). Using the Stages of Change framework, we concluded that 29% of women were in the "Preparation" stage, 21% were in the "Contemplation" stage, and 50% were in the "Pre-Contemplation" stage. We demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict future healthcare-seeking behavior based on information learned during the initial encounter. Models like this may help intervention developers to tailor strategies and content in real-time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is known to be beneficial for health, but adherence to international PA guidelines is low across different subpopulations. Interventions have been designed to stimulate PA of different target groups by influencing relevant psycho-social determinants, essentially based on a combination of the Integrated Model for Change, the Theory of Planned Behaviour, its successor the Reasoned Action Approach and the self-determination theory. The current study investigates the pathways through which interventions influence PA. Further, gender differences in pathways of change are studied. Methods: An integrated dataset of five different randomised controlled trial intervention studies is analysed by estimating a Bayesian network. The data include measurements, at baseline and at 3, 6 (short-term), and 12 (long-term) months after the baseline, of important socio-cognitive determinants of PA, demographic factors, and PA outcomes. A fragment is extracted from the Bayesian network consisting of paths between the intervention variable, determinants, and short- and long-term PA outcomes. For each relationship between variables, a stability indicator and its mutual information are computed. Such a model is estimated for the full dataset, and in addition such a model is estimated based only on male and female participants' data to investigate gender differences. Results: The general model (for the full dataset) shows complex paths, indicating that the intervention affects shortterm PA via the direct determinants of intention and habit and that self-efficacy, attitude, intrinsic motivation, social influence concepts, planning and commitment have an indirect influence. The model also shows how effects are maintained in the long-term and that previous PA behaviour, intention and attitude pros are direct determinants of long-term PA. The gender-specific models show similarities as well as important differences between the structures of paths for the male- and female subpopulations. For both subpopulations, intention and habit play an important role for short-term effects and maintenance of effects in the long-term. Differences are found in the role of self-efficacy in paths of behaviour change and in the fact that attitude is relevant for males, whereas planning plays a crucial role for females. The average of these differences in subpopulation mechanisms appears to be presented in the general model. Conclusions: While previous research provided limited insight into how interventions influence PA through relevant determinants, the Bayesian network analyses show the relevance of determinants mentioned by the theoretical framework. The model clarifies the role that different determinants play, especially in interaction with each other. The Bayesian network provides new knowledge about the complex working mechanism of interventions to change PA by giving an insightful overview of influencing paths. Furthermore, by presenting subpopulation-specific networks, the difference between the influence structure of males and females is illustrated. These new insights can be used to improve interventions in order to enhance their effects. To accomplish this, we have developed a new methodology based on a Bayesian network analysis which may be applicable in various other studies.

N2  - Objective: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental disorder characterized by emotional crises. To date, crisis interventions for BPD have been conducted via telephone calls and emergency units, which are associated with an extra amount of resources. The aim of this research was to test the usability and satisfaction with a psychotherapeutic mobile app for self-managing crises in BPD. Method: The B.RIGHT app was designed based on Artificial Intelligence psychotherapeutic algorithms. Usability and satisfaction with the app were assessed in 25 outpatients diagnosed with BPD (84% female, mean age = 35.80 years) using the System Usability Scale (SUS) and other questionnaires. Clinical features were assessed using the Borderline Symptom List, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Beck's Depression Inventory. Results: Patients with BPD considered the app user-friendly (mean total score = 4.03) and highly satisfactory (mean total score = 4.02), resulting in a positive user experience (mean total score = 4.09). Total usability was negatively associated with age (r = -.44), positively associated with educational level (rho = .47) and with overall emotion dysregulation (r = .51), and negatively associated with depression severity (r = -.47). Conclusions: The usability and satisfaction testing of the B.RIGHT app showed promising findings, which warrant further research in order to validate its effectiveness.

N2  - This special issue, "Evidence-Based Clinical and Educational Digital Interventions via Video, Mobile Health, Apps and Wearable Technologies", will help providers, faculty, residents, program directors, administrators, and other interprofessional partners improve clinical care, training, and leadership at the interface of behavioral health and technology for culturally and otherwise diverse populations. When recruiting authors, we asked them to consider a variety of topics such as applying the evidence base on technology to clinical assessment, triage, consultation, and treatment of behavioral and mental disorders; skills, attitudes, and knowledge for providers to use technologies to help patients via evidence-based approaches; translating best research practices to the bedside and between healthcare systems; using implementation science methods to promote adoption and integration of evidence-based technology-based practices, interventions and policies into routine health care and public health settings; and exploring the unintended consequences of monitoring and sensing technologies used for daily life, health, and health care. We purposely discouraged certain types of submissions: those simply on new apps that are "cool" or innovative, but not evaluated systematically; "good" ideas without demonstrated impact; "commercials" for publically available products; and case reports, editorials, and other papers that were not generally applicable to a variety of populations and settings.

N2  - Background: Digital pills are pills combined with a sensor, which sends a signal to a patch connected to a smartphone when the pills are ingested. Health care professionals can access patient data from digital pills online via their own interface, thus allowing them to check whether a patient took the drug. Digital pills were developed for the stated goal of improving treatment adherence. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first digital pills in November 2017, but the manufacturer withdrew its application to the European Medicines Agency in July 2020 because of insufficient evaluation. Objective: As recommended for the evaluation of health technologies, this study assesses the prospective acceptability of and willingness to take digital pills among patients, the public, and health care professionals. Methods: Participants were patients who were receiving long-term treatment for a chronic condition, public participants (both groups recruited from a representative sample), and health care professionals. Participants answered 5 open-ended questions regarding the acceptability of digital pills and 1 close-ended question regarding the willingness to take digital pills, which were developed in a preliminary qualitative study. We explored the 5 theoretical dimensions of acceptability by performing an abductive qualitative content analysis of all free-text responses. We assessed data saturation with mathematical models. We fitted a multivariate logistic regression model to identify the sociodemographic and health characteristics associated with the willingness to take digital pills. Results: Between January 29, 2020, and April 18, 2020, 767 patients, 1238 public participants, and 246 health care professionals provided 11,451 free-text responses. We identified 98 codes related to the acceptability of digital pills: 29 codes on perceived clinical effectiveness (eg, sensor safety cited by 66/2251 participants, 29.5%), 6 on perceived burden (eg, increased doctors' workload, 164/2251 participants, 7.3%), 25 on perceived ethicality (eg, policing, 345/2251 participants, 15.3%), 30 codes on perceived opportunity (eg, exclusively negative perception, 690/2251 participants, 30.7%), and 8 on affective attitude (eg, anger, 541/2251, 24%). Overall, 271/767 (35.3%) patients, 376/1238 (30.4%) public participants, and 39/246 (15.8%) health care professionals reported willingness to take digital pills. This willingness was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1.98, 95% CI 1.62-2.43) and current use of a connected device to record health settings (with a dose-response relationship). Conclusions: The prospective acceptability of and willingness to take digital pills were limited by clinical and ethical concerns both at the individual and societal level. Our results suggest that digital pills should not be considered a mere change in the form of drug administration but a complex intervention requiring specific evaluation before extended use in clinical routine practice as well as an ethical and legal framework to ensure safe and ethical collection and use of health data through a patient-centered approach.

N2  - Online hate speech on social media platforms causes harm to those who are victimized as well as society at large. The prevalence of hateful content has, thus, prompted numerous calls for improved countermeasures and prevention. For such interventions to be effective, it is necessary to gain a nuanced understanding of influences that facilitate the spread of hate speech. This study does so by investigating what are relevant digital determinants for online hate perpetration. Moreover, the study explores possibilities of different technology-driven interventions for prevention. Thereby, the study specifically considers the digital environments in which online hate speech is most often produced and disseminated, namely social media platforms. We apply frameworks related to the concept of digital affordances to focus on the role that technological features of these platforms play in the context of online hate speech. Data were collected using the Delphi method in which a selected sample of experts from both research and practice answered multiple rounds of surveys with the goal of reaching a group consensus. The study encompassed an open-ended collection of initial ideas, followed by a multiple-choice questionnaire to identify, and rate the most relevant determinants. Usefulness of the suggested intervention ideas was assessed through the three lenses of human-centered design. The results of both thematic analysis and non-parametric statistics yield insights on how features of social media platforms can be both determinants that facilitate online hate perpetration as well as crucial mechanisms of preventive interventions. Implications of these findings for future intervention development are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Following the outbreak of COVID-19, several studies have reported that young adults encountered a rise in anxiety symptoms, which could negatively affect their quality of life. Promising evidence suggests that mobile apps with biofeedback, serious games, breathing exercises, and positive messaging, among other features, are useful for anxiety self-management and treatment. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate the usability of a biofeedback-based app with serious games for young adults with anxiety in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: This study consists of two phases: Phase I describes the design and development of the app, while Phase II presents the results of a usability evaluation by experts. To elicit the app's requirements during Phase I, we conducted (1) a survey to investigate preferences of young adults in the UAE for mobile games for stress relief; (2) an analysis of serious games for anxiety; and (3) interviews with mental health professionals and young adults in the UAE. In Phase II, five experts tested the usability of the developed app using a set of Nielsen's usability heuristics. Results: A fully functional biofeedback-based app with serious games was co-designed with mental health professionals. The app included 4 games (ie, a biofeedback game, card game, arcade game, and memory game), 2 relaxation techniques (ie, a breathing exercise and yoga videos), and 2 additional features (ie, positive messaging and a mood tracking calendar). The results of Phase II showed that the developed app is efficient, simple, and easy to use. Overall, the app design scored an average of 4 out of 5. Conclusions: The elicitation techniques used in Phase I resulted in the development of an easy-to-use app for the self-management of anxiety. Further research is required to determine the app's usability and effectiveness in the target population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Slow-paced breathing training can have positive effects on physiological and psychological well-being. Unfortunately, use statistics indicate that adherence to breathing training apps is low. Recent work suggests that gameful breathing training may help overcome this challenge. Objective: This study aimed to introduce and evaluate the gameful breathing training app Breeze 2 and its novel real-time breathing detection algorithm that enables the interactive components of the app. Methods: We developed the breathing detection algorithm by using deep transfer learning to detect inhalation, exhalation, and nonbreathing sounds (including silence). An additional heuristic prolongs detected exhalations to stabilize the algorithm's predictions. We evaluated Breeze 2 with 30 participants (women: n = 14, 47%; age: mean 29.77, SD 7.33 years). Participants performed breathing training with Breeze 2 in 2 sessions with and without headphones. They answered questions regarding user engagement (User Engagement Scale Short Form [UES-SF]), perceived effectiveness (PE), perceived relaxation effectiveness, and perceived breathing detection accuracy. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the UES-SF, PE, and perceived relaxation effectiveness scores with neutral scores. Furthermore, we correlated perceived breathing detection accuracy with actual multi-class balanced accuracy to determine whether participants could perceive the actual breathing detection performance. We also conducted a repeated-measure ANOVA to investigate breathing detection differences in balanced accuracy with and without the heuristic and when classifying data captured from headphones and smartphone microphones. The analysis controlled for potential between-subject effects of the participants' sex. Results: Our results show scores that were significantly higher than neutral scores for the UES-SF (W = 459; P < .001), PE (W = 465; P < .001), and perceived relaxation effectiveness (W = 358; P < .001). Perceived breathing detection accuracy correlated significantly with the actual multi-class balanced accuracy (r = 0.51; P < .001). Furthermore, we found that the heuristic significantly improved the breathing detection balanced accuracy (F1,25 = 6.23; P = .02) and that detection performed better on data captured from smartphone microphones than than on data from headphones (F1,25 = 17.61; P < .001). We did not observe any significant between-subject effects of sex. Breathing detection without the heuristic reached a multi-class balanced accuracy of 74% on the collected audio recordings. Conclusions: Most participants (28/30, 93%) perceived Breeze 2 as engaging and effective. Furthermore, breathing detection worked well for most participants, as indicated by the perceived detection accuracy and actual detection accuracy. In future work, we aim to use the collected breathing sounds to improve breathing detection with regard to its stability and performance. We also plan to use Breeze 2 as an intervention tool in various studies targeting the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases.

N2  - Background: Against a long-term trend of increasing demand, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global rise in common mental disorders. Now more than ever, there is an urgent need for scalable, evidence-based interventions to support mental well-being. Objective: The aim of this proof-of-principle study was to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile-based app in adults with self-reported symptoms of anxiety and stress in a randomized control trial that took place during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Methods: Adults with mild to severe anxiety and moderate to high levels of perceived stress were randomized to either the intervention or control arm. Participants in the intervention arm were given access to the Foundations app for the duration of the 4-week study. All participants were required to self-report a range of validated measures of mental well-being (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience scale [CD-RISC-10], 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7], Office of National Statistics Four Subjective Well-being Questions [ONS-4], World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index [WHO-5]) and sleep (Minimal Insomnia Scale [MISS]) at baseline and at weeks 2 and 4. The self-reported measures of perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Score [PSS-10]) were obtained weekly. Results: A total of 136 participants completed the study and were included in the final analysis. The intervention group (n = 62) showed significant improvements compared to the control group (n = 74) on measures of anxiety, with a mean GAD-7 score change from baseline of -1.35 (SD 4.43) and -0.23 (SD 3.24), respectively (t134 = 1.71, P = .04); resilience, with a mean change in CD-RISC score of 1.79 (SD 4.08) and -0.31 (SD 3.16), respectively (t134 = -3.37, P < .001); sleep, with a mean MISS score change of -1.16 (SD 2.67) and -0.26 (SD 2.29), respectively (t134 = 2.13, P = .01); and mental well-being, with a mean WHO-5 score change of 1.53 (SD 5.30) and -0.23 (SD 4.20), respectively (t134 = -2.16, P = .02), within 2 weeks of using Foundations, with further improvements emerging at week 4. Perceived stress was also reduced within the intervention group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance relative to the control group, with a PSS score change from baseline to week 2 of -2.94 (SD 6.84) and -2.05 (SD 5.34), respectively (t134 = 0.84, P = .20). Conclusions: This study provides a proof of principle that the digital mental health app Foundations can improve measures of mental well-being, anxiety, resilience, and sleep within 2 weeks of use, with greater effects after 4 weeks. Foundations therefore offers potential as a scalable, cost-effective, and accessible solution to enhance mental well-being, even during times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Purpose: Digital mental health interventions (DMHI) may enhance equity in college student mental health, but engagement with them is poor. Little is known about barriers and strategies to enhance DMHI uptake among college students of color. The goal of this study was to attain expert consensus on important barriers to DMHI uptake and important and feasible engagement strategies to enhance DMHI uptake among college students of color. Methods: The study utilized a modified, three-round Delphi survey. Researcher and industry stakeholders with relevant expertise participated (n = 35). Across rounds, experts generated and rated the importance and feasibility of barriers and strategies to promote DMHI uptake for students of color. Experts viewed group consensus and importance ratings between rounds and were provided the opportunity to re-rate items. Barriers and strategies were coded into frameworks using rapid qualitative analysis and grounded theory techniques. Results: A total of n = 63 barriers and n = 64 strategies were derived, and consensus on level of importance was met for 98% of barriers and strategies. Key barriers included mistrust of mental health services and lack of culturally responsive care. Strategies spanned levels of implementation and emphasized codesign, diverse representation, reducing user burden, addressing privacy issues, and embedding DMHI within existing infrastructure. Conclusions: This study identified barriers and strategies for improving DMHI uptake for college students of color. The subset of highly feasible and important engagement strategies derived in this study provides direction for the design of scalable engagement interventions with the potential to improve DMHI implementation and reduce disparities in care receipt.

N2  - The bipolar disorders (BD) summary succinctly recognises the lack of compelling evidence regarding the efficacy of eHealth for this population. It could be reasonably argued, given the guideline's focus on evidence and consensus-based recommendations, that digital interventions for BD do not yet warrant in-depth comment in light of the nascent stage of the supporting literature. Healthcare providers are a trusted source of information, and as such may play an important role in safeguarding patients by recommending apps that meet acceptable standards for safety, privacy protections, and clinical foundation/evidence. There is value in keeping these summaries as concise as possible to increase their uptake by busy clinicians. Furthermore, there are fundamental tensions in providing a static map to guide clinicians when the eHealth for BD landscape itself is shifting rapidly. It is likely that new technological developments, such as machine learning, virtual reality, wearable sensors and passive data monitoring will challenge the ability of such abridged resources to keep clinicians abreast of best practices (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: People with substance use disorders often differ in their decision-making styles. The present study addressed the impact of two decision-making styles (rational and dependent) on outcomes from a StaySafe tablet computer app intervention designed to improve decision-making around health risk behaviors and previously found to be effective for justice-involved people receiving treatment for a substance use disorder and under community supervision. Objectives: Participants were justice-involved residents in residential treatment. After completing a baseline survey, participants were randomly assigned to either complete the StaySafe app or to a standard procedure condition; and then asked to complete a post-intervention survey three months after baseline (this protocol has been registered with clinicaltrials.gov NCT02777086): 348 participants completed a baseline survey and 238 completed the post-test survey. Outcomes included measures of confidence and motivation around HIV knowledge and risks and getting tested. Multilevel analyses addressed the hypothesis that outcomes were related to decision-making style. Multiple imputation (MI) was used to address the effects of missing data. Results: StaySafe was more effective for those in the lower half of the decision-making dependent scale for HIV risks (HIV-Knowledge, Hepatitis testing, HIV Services testing, and Sex Risk, as well as motivation for treatment. The decision-making rational scale was less consistently related to HIV risk. Conclusions: The present study showed individuals with substance use disorders who differed in their decision-making styles reacted differently to the StaySafe intervention. Two scales, rational decision making, and dependent decision making are relevant to consider with respect to interventions targeting improving decision making among drug users.

N2  - Underserved populations, including those from racial and ethnic groups and with low socioeconomic status, often lack access to mobile apps aimed at reducing health risk factors. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the mobile app, My Wellness Coach (MWC), designed to promote behavior change in seven core areas of integrative health among underserved populations. Patients and staff were recruited from clinic and other settings. Some participants used MWC in a weekly group setting (n = 5); others on their own with support from a coordinator (n = 36). Health outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 months. Mobile app ratings were collected at 5 weeks and 3 months. Goal setting data were analyzed at 3 months. Most participants (76%) set at least one goal, 71% created action steps for goals, and 29% completed a goal. Patients in the group setting had the highest rate of goal completion (60%) compared to patients (20%) and staff (27%) using the app on their own. Significant (p < .05) changes in pre- and post-test scores were documented for overall wellbeing, global physical health, BMI, vigorous physical activity, and eHealth literacy. Most participants (75%-91%) gave MWC high ratings for impact on behavior change, help seeking, intent to change, attitudes, knowledge, and awareness. This study documented preliminary evidence of the potential benefits of MWC among underserved communities. Future evaluations of Spanish and Android versions and comparisons between group and individual administration will inform implementation strategies for scaling MWC-based interventions to reach underserved communities nationally. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Practice: Mobile apps may be used to promote behavior change and reduce chronic health risk factors among underserved populations. Policy: Community health centers, other health organizations, and businesses should establish partnerships to develop, implement, and evaluate app-based interventions to promote the health and well-being of underserved populations. Research: Future research should include rigorous randomized controlled trials with mobile health apps with underserved populations, including those diagnosed with chronic health conditions. Many underserved populations, including those from diverse racial and ethnic groups and with low income, do not have access to mobile apps to improve health. This study examined whether using the My Wellness Coach (MWC) app was feasible, acceptable, and effective. MWC was designed to promote behavior change in integrative health (Movement, Nutrition, Spirituality, Resilience, Relationships, Sleep, and Environment) among underserved populations. Five participants used MWC in a group setting and 36 participants used MWC on their own with assistance from a coordinator. Participants completed surveys at the beginning of the study and 3 months later. Most participants (76%) set at least one health goal, 71% created action steps for goals, and 29% completed a goal. Participants who used MWC with the weekly group had the highest rate of goal completion (60%). Participants reported significant changes in wellbeing, physical health, body mass index, physical activity, and ability to find and understand electronic health information. Most participants (75%-91%) gave MWC positive ratings. This study provided evidence of the potential benefits of MWC among underserved communities. Future studies with Spanish and Android versions and comparisons between group and individual administration will inform strategies for expanding the reach of MWC-based interventions to underserved communities.

N2  - Introduction: There is a need for enhanced preventive health care among airline pilots to mitigate the prevalence of cardiometabolic health risk factors. Study Design: A randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based app intervention for improving health behaviors and cardiometabolic health parameters. Setting/participants: A total of 186 airline pilots (aged 43.2+/-9.1 years; male, 64%) were recruited and participated in the trial during 2022. Intervention: This intervention was a personalized, 16-week smartphone-based app multicomponent physical activity, healthy eating, and sleep hygiene intervention. Main outcome measures: Outcome measures of objective health (Cooper's 12-minute exercise test, resting heart rate, push ups, plank isometric hold, body mass), subjective health (self-rated health, perceived psychological stress and fatigue), and health behaviors (weekly physical activity, sleep quality and duration, fruit and vegetable intake) were collected at baseline and after intervention. The waitlist control completed the same measures. Results: Significant interactions for time X group from baseline to 16 weeks were found for all outcome measures (p<0.001). Significant between-group differences for positive health changes in favor of the intervention group were found after intervention for all outcome measures (p<0.05, d=0.4-1.0) except for self-rated health, body mass, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score. Conclusions: Study findings show that an app-based health behavior intervention can elicit positive cardiometabolic health changes among airline pilots over 16 weeks, associated with trivial to large effect sizes.

N2  - Reports an error in "Pilot randomized controlled trial of feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a web-based physical activity and sedentary time intervention for survivors of physical inactivity-related cancers" by Erika Rees-Punia, Corinne R. Leach, J. Lee Westmaas, Lauren F. Dempsey, Amelia M. Roberts, Joe R. Nocera and Alpa V. Patel (International Journal of Behavioral Medicine, Advanced Online Publication, May 6, 2021, np). The original online version of this article was revised to include an additional statement in the Acknowledgements required by the National Program of Cancer Registries. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2021-44042-001). Background This pilot study explored the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a web-based intervention for survivors of physical inactivity-related cancers through a two-arm, 12-week randomized controlled trial. Secondarily, this study tested the change in physical activity (PA) and sedentary time with intervention exposure. MethodsPrior to randomization to the intervention (n = 45) or behavior "as usual" wait-listed control (n = 40) groups, participants completed baseline surveys and an accelerometer protocol. The intervention focused on increasing PA and decreasing sedentary time through social cognitive theory techniques. Follow-up acceptability/usability surveys (intervention group only) and accelerometers were sent after the intervention period. Information on intervention completion, adverse events, and user statistics were collected to determine feasibility. Median login time and mean acceptability/usability scores were calculated. Results Participants (mean age = 60 +/- 7 years) included female (n = 80, 94%) and male survivors of breast (82%), colon (6%), endometrial (6%), bladder (4%), and kidney (2%) cancer. Seventy-eight (91.7%) participants returned partially or fully complete post-intervention data. There were no reported injuries or safety concerns. Intervention participants logged into the website for a total of 95 min (Q1, Q3 = 11, 204). System usability scores (72 +/- 3) indicated above average usability of the website. Changes in time spent active and sedentary were not statistically significantly different between groups (p = 0.45), but within-group changes suggested intervention group participants spent more time active and less time sedentary after the intervention. Conclusion Results of this pilot study suggest its feasibility and acceptability for survivors of several inactivity-related cancers. Additional research to determine long-term efficacy is warranted. This low-cost online-only intervention has the potential to have a very broad reach. Trial Registration Clinical Trials Number: NCT03983083.

N2  - ABSTRACT Patient activation is associated with treatment adherence, self-accountability for healthcare and a healthy lifestyle change. Mobile health (m-Health) apps can lead to greater patient treatment adherence and health behaviour change. This study aimed to evaluate the health behaviour change of elderly people through a healthcare programme focused on activation with the support of technology. Three phases were conducted: (1) pre-intervention - design of the intervention protocol and the app, (2) intervention - randomised clinical trial with 41 overweight/obese elderly people. m-Health app-supported group psychotherapy was compared with group psychotherapy only and individual psychotherapy (control) and (3) post-intervention - statistical analysis, intervention's assistant interviews and app heuristics evaluation. By crossing the results, the study has shown that there was no significant difference in the activation level before and after intervention between groups. However, there was a significant increase from the initial mean score to the final one when considering the three groups together. Group therapy, whether with or without the support of the app, was more effective for behaviour change measured by the achievement of the goals, than individual psychotherapy. The lack of impact on group therapy with app support calls into question which and how much technology support is useful. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Trauma-informed care is a relatively new construct in K-12 education, and districts across the United States are seeking avenues to meet the needs of their students. The COVID-19 pandemic elevated the need for districts to develop appropriate supports to address student and adult trauma. Traumatic events can affect a child's mental, physical, social-emotional, and/or spiritual well-being (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, 2011). Furthermore, children with an elevated risk of trauma may not be able to access these supports outside of the school setting (Baweja et al., 2015). Therefore, educational systems need to develop trauma-informed care models for schools that furnish a sense of safety and community so that students receive the necessary support. This evaluation aimed to identify how the moderating factors of district administrators, site administrators, climate and culture, and teacher capacity affect trauma-informed care via a multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) framework. It included a specific focus on Tier 1, universal access, to improve timely support for students.This formative program evaluation explored the impact of the moderating factors through the viewpoint of a newly created conceptual framework. I used qualitative and quantitative data sources to explore the multiple aspects of the phenomenon. The ARTIC-45 provided descriptive statistics about educators' attitudes toward trauma-informed care. The observational data and analysis of the Panorama Education social-emotional learning (SEL) survey that assessed 3rd-12th students social-emotional well-being provided character to the evaluation.The data analysis yielded inconsistent results. The observational data strongly indicated a trauma-informed environment in which students were given clear expectations and engaged in positive reciprocal interactions with peers and adults. The ARTIC-45 data showed that administrators, teachers, and support staff responded favorably to trauma-informed care approaches. Though statistical significance could not be obtained due to the sample size constraint of being too small, the data provided context to the other data sources. For example, teacher capacity could not be quantified, but the data provided context to the overall staff capacity. The review of the archival and current SEL survey data showed that favorability among domains varied by site and grade level. The variations in students' social-emotional favorability can be related to their lived experiences and it is important to track over time to monitor how experiences, expressions, and feelings change over time. Students' perspectives regarding themselves and their environment differed from the observational data. This indicates that educators should not solely rely on observational data to determine students' social-emotional well-being. Furthermore, an SEL survey can be used as a tool to understand students' well-being and thus provide them with timely support.The evaluation determined that district administration, site administration, climate and culture and staff capacity can positively impact a multi-tiered, trauma-informed care environment. In these settings student behavior and social-emotional well-being is viewed in a healing -centered manner. Districts can create a multi-tiered, trauma-sensitive culture and provide support to enhance teachers' capacity to implement trauma-informed care, take advantage of administrative influence, develop community partnerships, and create a culture that is open to systematic change.Keywords: adverse childhood experience (ACE), trauma-informed care (TIC), multi-tiered system of supports (MTSS), moderating factors, district administrators, site administrators, staff capacity, school climate and culture, theory of change, fidelity of implementation (FOI).

N2  - Background: Barriers to recruiting and retaining people with psychosis and their families in research are well-established, potentially biasing clinical research samples. Digital research tools, such as online platforms, mobile apps, and text messaging, have the potential to address barriers to research by facilitating remote participation. However, there has been limited research on leveraging these technologies to engage people with psychosis and their families in research. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the uptake of digital tools to engage patients with provisional psychosis and their families in research and their preferences for different research administration methods. Methods: This study used Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)-a secure web-based platform with built-in tools for data collection and storage-to send web-based consent forms and surveys on service engagement via text message or email to patients and families referred to early psychosis intervention services; potential participants were also approached or reminded about the study in person. We calculated completion rates and timing using remote and in-person methods and compensation preferences. Results: A total of 447 patients with provisional psychosis and 187 of their family members agreed to receive the web-based consent form, and approximately half of the patients (216/447, 48.3%) and family members (109/187, 58.3%) consented to participate in the survey. Most patients (182/229, 79.5%) and family members (75/116, 64.7%) who completed the consent form did so remotely, with more family members (41/116, 35.3%) than patients (47/229, 20.5%) completing it in person. Of those who consented, 77.3% (167/216) of patients and 72.5% (79/109) of family members completed the survey, and most did the survey remotely. Almost all patients (418/462, 90.5%) and family members (174/190, 91.6%) requested to receive the consent form and survey by email, and only 4.1% (19/462) and 3.2% (6/190), respectively, preferred text message. Just over half of the patients (91/167, 54.5%) and family members (42/79, 53.2%) preferred to receive electronic gift cards from a coffee shop as study compensation. Most surveys were completed on weekdays between 12 PM and 6 PM. Conclusions: When offered the choice, most participants with psychosis and their families chose remote administration methods, suggesting that digital tools may enhance research recruitment and participation in this population, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 global pandemic.

N2  - Background The support of her infant's father is one of the most important factors influencing a mother's breastfeeding success, and an increasing number of interventions are targeted towards fathers. Engaging fathers as agents to influence a maternal behavior is potentially problematic, yet few studies report on maternal experiences. Objective This study aims to explore mothers' perspectives of their partners' use of Milk Man, a father-focused breastfeeding smartphone app, and the acceptability of this approach. Materials and methods New mothers (N = 459) whose partners had access to the app completed a questionnaire at six weeks postpartum. These data were used to determine knowledge, use and perspectives of the app. A sentiment analysis was conducted on responses to an open-ended question seeking maternal perspectives of the app. Results Just over a quarter of mothers (28%) had been shown something from the app, and 37% had discussed something from Milk Man with their partner. There were 162 open-ended responses related to mothers' perspectives of the app. Relevant responses (n = 129) were coded to an overall sentiment node and then to a total of 23 child nodes (sub-nodes). Most comments were positive (94), with a smaller number either negative (25) or neutral (21). Negative comments related to the usability of the app and not its intent or content. Conclusion Mothers found the father-focused breastfeeding app to be acceptable. When designing interventions targeting one group to affect the behaviour of another, inclusion of measures to gain the perspectives of both should be seen as an imperative.

N2  - Comments on an article by Daniel D.L. Coppersmith et al. (see record 2022-84508-001). In the article, Coppersmith and colleagues provide a theoretical framework for leveraging advanced digital technologies to improve suicide risk detection and intervention through just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). Over the last several decades, there has been growing interest and investment in developing strategies and interventions to drive down the number of suicide deaths. Unfortunately, suicide is a vexing problem to solve, and many of the interventions and strategies deployed to prevent suicide have yet to produce significant declines in suicide rates. At the center of this vexing problem is not knowing precisely who is contemplating suicide, when the person is thinking of attempting suicide and how to best reach out and help the person who is considering suicide. In the current article by Coppersmith and colleagues, the authors posit several novel "wearable" technology approaches that aim to formulate digital phenotypes and address the challenge of identifying individuals who may be at risk for suicide, in-real-time. Another main point of the article by Coppersmith and colleagues is how to best, in-situ, provide help to individuals who exhibit physical changes measured by wearable device or information reported via smartphone or web-based interactions that identify potential risk of suicide. Overall, the development and application of just-in-time adaptive interventions has the potential to revolutionize our approach to identification and protection of individuals in acute suicide crisis.

N2  - Comments on an article by Daniel D.L. Coppersmith et al. (see record 2022-84508-001). Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) for suicide prevention, using mobile health (mHealth) technologies including wearables, are the focus of an article recently written by Coppersmith et al. As a clinical psychologist with nearly two decades of professional experience in treating individuals with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), training mental health providers in the delivery of evidence-informed and evidence based suicide-focused care, and conducting research to advance suicide prevention and intervention science, the author is eager to write this commentary to share some of his thoughts on the topic. To best prepare for the journey ahead, an open, collaborative, and flexible approach is needed to engage patients, their family members and friends, primary care and mental health providers, and healthcare leaders with the mHealth movement, now involving JITAIs as well. The public messaging around JITAIs needs to focus on how technology can enhance the existing repertoire of tools and strategies available to providers and empower individuals with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) to take an active role in their own trajectory away from suicide. The promise of JITAIs for suicide prevention cannot be overstated. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa (BN) requires patient skill utilization (use of treatment skills) and skill acquisition (successful skill use) for symptom improvement. Treatment outcomes are unsatisfactory, possibly due to poor skill acquisition and utilization by post-treatment. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), momentary interventions delivered at opportunities for skill practice, may improve skill acquisition and utilization. Participants (N = 56 individuals with bulimia-spectrum eating disorders) completed electronic self-monitoring in CBT+ and received JITAIs or no JITAIs alongside 16 sessions of CBT. Feasibility, acceptability, target engagement, and treatment outcomes were evaluated. JITAIs demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. Treatment outcomes and target engagement did not differ between conditions. The lack of group differences in target engagement and treatment outcomes may be explained by skill use self-monitoring promoting skill utilization and acquisition or low statistical power. Our findings suggest that JITAIs are feasible and acceptable during CBT for BN and warrant additional study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) are widely used tools that provide support for people seeking help managing their health in a particular behavioral domain (e.g., physical activity). Despite their popularity, evidence for the effectiveness of mHealth apps as stand-alone behavioral interventions is limited. Psychological and behavioral scientists can play a critical role in addressing this gap by pursuing programs of research that leverage basic behavioral science principles to test links between key features of mHealth apps (e.g., goal setting, feedback) and behavior change. To demonstrate this approach to evaluating mHealth apps, we systematically examine five key features of popular calorie-tracking and activity-tracking apps, explain how these features align with established behavior change techniques, discuss the evidence base for the effectiveness of these techniques within each behavioral domain, and situate predictions about how individual app features may promote behavior change in a conceptual model. Through this work, researchers can guide the design of mHealth apps and optimize them for facilitating sustained health behavior change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental effects on mental health. Literature on the impact on individuals with eating disorders is slowly emerging. While outpatient eating disorder services in Canada have attempted to transition to virtual care, guidelines related to optimal virtual care in this field are lacking. As such, the objective of our Canadian Consensus Panel was to develop clinical practice guidelines related to the provision of virtual care for children, adolescents, and emerging adults living with an eating disorder, as well as their caregivers, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Methods: Using scoping review methodology (with literature in databases from 2000 to 2020 and grey literature from 2010 to 2020), the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system, the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation tool, and a panel of diverse stakeholders from across Canada, we developed high quality treatment guidelines that are focused on virtual interventions for children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, and their caregivers. Results: Strong recommendations were supported specifically in favour of in-person medical evaluation when necessary for children, adolescents, and emerging adults, and that equity-seeking groups and marginalized youth should be provided equal access to treatment. For children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for telehealth family-based treatment (FBT) and online guided parental self-help FBT. For emerging adults, internet cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)-based guided self-help was strongly recommended. Weak recommendations for emerging adults included CBT-based group internet interventions as treatment adjuncts, internet-based relapse prevention Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) guided self-help, telehealth relapse prevention using MANTRA, and guided CBT-based smartphone apps as treatment adjuncts. For caregivers of children and adolescents, weak recommendations were supported for virtual parent meal support training, and moderated online caregiver forums and support groups. For caregivers of emerging adults, guided parental self-help CBT was strongly recommended, and unguided caregiver psychoeducation self-help was weakly recommended. Conclusions: Several gaps for future work were identified including the impact of sex, gender, race, and socioeconomic status on virtual care among children, adolescents, and emerging adults with eating disorders, as well as research on more intensive services, such as virtual day hospitals.

N2  - Objectives: Episodic memory is age-sensitive but can be strengthened by targeted training interventions. The method of loci (MoL) is a classic mnemonic which if successfully implemented greatly improves memory performance. We developed and investigated the effects of a MoL training program implemented in a smart phone application (app) with the aim of studying usage of the application, training effect and its modifiability by age, predictors for MoL proficiency, transfer effects to a face-name memory task, and perceived benefit in everyday memory. Method: A total of 359 adults participated. Instruction and training of the MoL, transfer test (face-name paired associates cued recall task), and surveys were performed in an in-house developed app. Results: The app interested people across the adult life span. Older adults practiced the most, whereas younger and young-old participants showed the highest level of MoL proficiency. Level of proficiency was modulated by amount of practice, but in the oldest participants this effect was less pronounced. Greater self-rated health was associated with higher level of proficiency. No transfer effect was observed. Among those who answered the survey, about half expressed that MoL training had benefitted memory in their everyday life. Discussion: App-based memory training in the MoL can be delivered successfully via an app across the adult life span. Level of performance reached in training is variable but generally high, and mainly influenced by amount of training and age of the participants. Our data suggest plasticity across the life span, but to a lesser degree for adults between 70 and 90 years. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - On a worldwide scale, diabetes has become a substantial social health issue related to countless devastating health issues. Adherence to recommended medications is vital to ensure the efficacy of medical treatment regimens and more positive health outcomes. Self-management plays a crucial role in maintaining reasonable control of diabetes mellitus, and medication reminder smartphone applications such Medisafe, which remind diabetic patients to take their medications, have been used in interventions that have been shown to improve patient hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). This project uses a quasi-experimental, pre- and post-intervention design with a convenient population sample of diabetic type I & type II patients to explore the impact of the Medisafe medication reminder app. The goal was to implement an app-based intervention to reduce HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels among participants. The project took twelve weeks, including pre- and post-intervention data collection, and the intervention lasted for ten weeks. The mean HbA1c pre-intervention was 9.50%, and post-intervention HbA1c was 7.13%, with a mean difference of 2.37%. Fasting blood glucose pre-intervention was of 283.59 mg/dL, and post-intervention was 228.52mg/dL, with a mean difference of 55.07mg/dl. These findings were significant with p < 0.001.

N2  - Background: Emergency departments (EDs) have the potential to provide evidence-based practices for suicide prevention to patients who are acutely suicidal. However, few EDs have adequate time and personnel resources to deliver recommended evidence-based assessment and interventions. To raise the clinical standard of care for patients who are suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services in the ED, we developed Jaspr Health, a tablet-based app for direct use by such patients, which enables the delivery of 4 evidence-based practices. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Jaspr Health among suicidal adults in EDs. Methods: Patients who were acutely suicidal and seeking psychiatric crisis services participated in an unblinded pilot randomized controlled trial while in the ED. Participants were randomly assigned to Jaspr Health (n = 14) or care as usual (control; n = 17) groups. Participants were assessed at baseline, and a 2-hour posttest using self-report measures and a semistructured interview were conducted. Results: Conditions differed significantly at baseline with regard to age but not other demographic variables or baseline measures. On average, participants had been in the ED for 17 hours before enrolling in the study. Over their lifetime, 84% (26/31) of the sample had made a suicide attempt (mean 3.4, SD 6.4) and 61% (19/31) had engaged in nonsuicidal self-injurious behaviors, with an average rate of 8.8 times in the past 3 months. All established feasibility and acceptability criteria were met: no adverse events occurred, participants' app use was high, Jaspr Health app user satisfaction ratings were high, and all participants using Jaspr Health recommended its use for other suicidal ED patients. Comparisons between study conditions provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of the app: participants using Jaspr Health reported a statistically significant increase in receiving 4 evidence-based suicide prevention interventions and overall satisfaction ratings with their ED experience. In addition, significant decreases in distress and agitation, along with significant increases in learning to cope more effectively with current and future suicidal thoughts, were observed among participants using Jaspr Health compared with those receiving care as usual. Conclusions: Even with limited statistical power, the results showed that Jaspr Health is feasible, acceptable, and clinically effective for use by ED patients who are acutely suicidal and seeking ED-based psychiatric crisis services.

N2  - Reports the case of a patient with schizoaffective disorder who suffered a relapse shortly after using a mental health monitoring smartphone application. Mr. L. (a 35-year-old single white male) was enrolled in the SmartCrisis study which explores the use of a smartphone app (eB2) that monitors sleep, mobility, and mood. At the time of enrollment, Mr. L was stable and interested in the use of new technologies. During his follow-up visit two months later, he appeared suspicious and irritable. He had stopped using his smartphone as he claimed it had been hacked and accused us of plotting against him. He barely left home, as he felt constantly observed. After interviewing the patient and his relatives, we could not identify any potential triggers of psychotic relapse (including, recent drug use of life stressful events), other than the recent use of the eB2 application. His next appointment, as well as the date of administration of aripiprazole, were put forward. After a month of follow-up, he no longer expressed delusions, had started to use new technologies again and had resumed usual activities. This illustrates some potential side effects of mHealth interventions in mental healthcare, particularly in people suffering from severe mental illness. The patient developed paranoid delusions after using the eB2 for a short period of time. However, it is difficult to determine whether the application influenced the onset of the psychotic episode or was rather an activity engulfed by his altered mental state.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Mobile applications are increasingly part of mental health programs and various apps have been developed for treating anxiety disorders. Typically, they aim to improve anxiety symptoms via established CBT techniques, such as exposure principles, which are considered extremely unpleasant for fearful individuals. We combined in a mobile application exposure principles with gamification elements (e.g. narrative background, level progression, points, and feedback). These elements should increase the motivation for confronting spider images and decrease the experienced distress. To evaluate the application, two groups of spider-fearful individuals played either the Spider App (experimental group) or a non-spider associated app (control group) twice a day for approximately 12 min for 7 days. After this week, participants of the experimental group showed less avoidance behavior of spiders (BAT), as well as lower anxiety of spiders (SPQ, FAS). Groups were not different in measures of depression or psychological distress. Interestingly, participants playing the Spider App reported higher anxiety, disgust and arousal ratings shortly after playing the app. However, anxiety, disgust, and arousal ratings decreased from day to day. We discuss our findings with respect to implications for the clinical practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Hypertension (HTN) is a major, but treatable public health problem, afflicting nearly one in two adults in United States (U.S). Untreated HTN is associated with risks of other health sequela. Treatment success usually requires the patient to adhere to nonpharmacologic and/or pharmacologic regimen. Mobile health (mHealth) app-based interventions are often employed to manage HTN, and evidence corresponding to their effectiveness abounds. The purpose of this project is to assess the impact of "Omron Connect", an mHealth application-based self-management support program on systolic blood pressure (SBP) control. A convenient sample of 30 adults were enrolled but three dropped out prior to the project. The participants downloaded the apps on their mobile phones. The apps enabled the participants to transmit their daily self-management activities (SMAs), including daily blood pressure monitoring, adherence to medication, and engagement in physical exercise to a designated email for review by the project team leader. Project team members offered daily encouragement and support, eliminating the chances of noncompliance with SMAs. The outcomes were differences in SBP. At the end of the project, result revealed statistically significant difference between average participants' SBP preintervention (M = 144.78, SD = 3.04) and SBP (M = 139.44, SD = 2.22) postintervention. Omron Connect app-based self-management support program for HTN is associated with reduction in SBP among hypertensive adults ages 20 to 60 by 5.34mm/Hg in eight weeks.

N2  - [Retraction notice: A retraction for this article was reported in Vol 38(3) of Psychology of Addictive Behaviors (see record 2024-80287-001). This article is being retracted at the request of the publisher, and the editor and all authors of the original article consented. This article was published in error, as it is a first stage Registered Report that has received in-principle acceptance. Given the workflow of a Registered Report, the first journal publication appears after data collection and results have been reported in the second stage Registered Report submission (see workflow at https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports). This stage one article is being removed from the literature to avoid confusion and will instead be preregistered as a Registered Report Protocol Preregistration (https://osf.io/7euzd/).] Objective: Decades of research has found support for the motivational model of alcohol use, such that positive/negative affect are indirectly associated with drinking behavior through drinking motives. However, research on event-level drinking motives is in its nascent stage, and studies have yet to consider how drinking context plays a role in the motivational pathway to both event- and person-level drinking behavior. Therefore, the present study seeks to test whether drinking context mediates the effect of affect and motivation on drinking outcomes at both the event- and person-level. Method: Data for this Stage 1 Registered Report will come from a recently completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study in emerging adults. The study collected data on 131 emerging adults, of whom 107 reported event-level social and solitary drinking during the EMA period. Multilevel structural equation modeling will be used to test whether predrinking affect is associated with predrinking motives, and whether drinking context (social vs. solitary drinking) mediates the effect of drinking motives on drinking outcomes. Models will parse within-/between-person variance, allowing the present study to test whether drinking context serves as a mechanism of risk in the motivational model at the event-level, or solely at the between-person level. Findings will inform personalized interventions and motivational models of drinking behavior. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Drinking context is thought to be an important contextual predictor of risk for addictive behaviors, yet little research has tested whether it is a person-level or event-level risk factor within a motivational framework. The present study will test drinking context as a mechanism of risk at both levels, allowing the present study to determine whether person-level versus just-in-time interventions are more suitable for targeting drinking contexts.

N2  - Trials of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) often exclude individuals with suicide-related thoughts and behaviors precluding an understanding of whether DMHIs for affective disorders are safe for, and perform similarly within, this high-risk group. We explore the safety and performance of a DMHI for depression in participants with and without suicidal ideation (SI) at baseline. Three hundred and one participants were included in this secondary data analysis from a trial of an 8-week DMHI comprising 14 smartphone apps. We found that SI decreased across the study among participants with baseline SI and that baseline SI status did not attenuate depression treatment effects. Through a case study of the IntelliCare platform, we find that DMHIs for general affective disorders can be safe. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2023//
N2  - Background: While the negative consequences of insomnia are well-documented, a strengths-based understanding of how sleep can increase health promotion is still emerging and much-needed. Correlational evidence has connected sleep and insomnia to resilience; however, this relationship has not yet been experimentally tested. This study examined resilience as a mediator of treatment outcomes in a randomized clinical trial with insomnia patients. Methods: Participants were randomized to either digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I; n = 358) or sleep education control (n = 300), and assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-year follow-up. A structural equation modeling framework was utilized to test resilience as a mediator of insomnia and depression. Risk for insomnia and depression was also tested in the model, operationalized as a latent factor with sleep reactivity, stress, and rumination as indicators (aligned with the 3-P model). Sensitivity analyses tested the impact of change in resilience on the insomnia relapse and incident depression at 1-year follow-up. Results: dCBT-I resulted in greater improvements in resilience compared to the sleep education control. Furthermore, improved resilience following dCBT-I lowered latent risk, which was further associated with reduced insomnia and depression at 1-year follow-up. Sensitivity analyses indicated that each point improvement in resilience following treatment reduced the odds of insomnia relapse and incident depression 1 year later by 76% and 65%, respectively. Conclusions: Improved resilience is likely a contributing mechanism to treatment gains following insomnia therapy, which may then reduce longer-term risk for insomnia relapse and depression.

T1  - Mental health attitudes and perceptions of a PTSD smartphone intervention among law enforcement: A pilot study.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have advanced in recent years, providing easy access to confidential mental health support via smartphone applications. PTSD Coach, an mHealth intervention designed for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder, has demonstrated positive outcomes in community and veteran samples. There are several populations-specific adaptions of PTSD Coach, although a version for law enforcement has yet to be created. The purpose of this study was to identify law enforcement attitudes toward mental health treatment and perceptions of the PTSD Coach app, to be used for adapting a version of PTSD Coach designed for law enforcement. Recruitment targeted personal law enforcement contacts and online law enforcement forums. Attitudes were assessed with a questionnaire which was completed before and after exploring PTSD Coach. Perceptions of PTSD Coach were assessed following exposure to each of the three primary app sections. Participants were also optionally screened for PTSD status. Participation in the study was limited, ranging from 10 to 42 participants at various points of the survey. Results were not significant and conclusions regarding the hypotheses could not be made due to the small sample size. However, initial findings suggest that members of law enforcement are satisfied with PTSD Coach and believe it to be helpful. Scatterplots suggest that relationships may be developing between PTSD status and attitudes toward both seeking mental health treatment and using a PTSD app. Despite inconclusive results, valuable information was gained from recruitment and response patterns of the participants. It is suspected that recruitment and retention of participants would be most successful by employing members of law enforcement to recruit peers and colleagues on behalf of the study team. Future studies would find it worthwhile to investigate the app-use decision making process by exploring which factors are most likely to influence law enforcement members' willingness to engage with a PTSD app, including whether members of law enforcement might be more willing to use a PTSD app if it were recommended by a colleague. Understanding such processes would allow for improved app marketing and retention strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Adolescent mental health in the developing world: Three economic analyses on stressors, coping, and support.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Adolescents are slowly being recognized as a generation, worldwide, that may require different policy approaches to improve staggering statistics on their failing wellbeing, including mental health. By providing the support to allow the next generation to achieve better mental health outcomes, they are going to be more economically successful and the future economic growth of nations can be better assured. In face of such a need, this dissertation approaches the evaluation of a number of key stressors and elements of coping and support. Each chapter produces results which overcome limitations throughout existing literature in terms of the simultaneous consideration of both rigorous econometric-based analyses and strong conceptual frameworks. Each chapter also contains relevant policy implications and recommendations which are believed to hold good promise for improving the relevant adolescent mental health problems addressed in each respective chapter.Chapter 2 addresses the issue of connections between mobile-based health (mHealth) interventions aimed at improving the wellbeing of adolescent and evidence of negative wellbeing/mental health outcomes. We investigate this using primary data from a large-scale, school-based survey of older adolescents in southwestern Nepal, to assess this tension between mobile/smartphone usage as a true mobile health (mHealth) opportunity in Nepal or as a potential problem, introducing additional deleterious wellbeing effects from over-use. Founded in Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT), robust results of analyses using full structural modeling approaches (and traditional regression-based sensitivity analyses) indicate support for the BPNT framework in explaining statistically significant associations between bullying and wellbeing outcomes, including evidence to support the mediating role of problematic mobile phone use. Chapter 3 expands consideration of adolescent mental health to across the developing world, where suicide has become a leading cause of all adolescent deaths. Using data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) of six different countries, analysis involves estimation of a reduced-form, simultaneous model incorporating specialized clustering to determine the influence of both positive and negative components of social integration on five different deleterious health outcomes, including three levels of suicidal behavior. Robust results indicate that positive parenting and social exclusion reduce and increase the likelihood of all outcomes, respectively, among both pooled and individual country samples. Such results provide an impetus for pursuing interventions in LMICs, including those aimed at suicide prevention, which focus on social-based, multi-level approaches. Finally, Chapter 4, examines a particularly stressful situation faced by female adolescents in regions such as Nepal. Informed by the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, this chapter evaluates the roles that cultural and school environments play in appraisals of menstruation as a major life stressor and the impacts of emotional stress on missing school. Using primary survey data from schools in both the Terai and Hill areas of Nepal, conditional mixed-process (CMP) estimation with fixed effects, utilizing multiple index building techniques, including principle component and multiple correspondence analysis were performed. Robust results are found in support of the theoretical framework, showing that strong cultural norms during menstruation increase the probability of girls self-reporting as feeling lonely, while presence of hygiene supporting infrastructure at schools reduces this outcome. Furthermore, there is strong support for the hypothesis that the presence of emotional stress during menstruation increases the likelihood of not only missing school, but for a longer period of time.

N2  - Health communication as a field of scientific endeavor and practice in the 21st century is multifaceted. It covers the traditional public health campaigns by which a well-crafted message can raise awareness of a danger, pique motivation, and instill clarity for personal action. At a population level, these broad ranging campaigns have the potential of reaching substantial numbers of the population quickly, as was necessary during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2020; and they can reduce risks of mortality from chronic disease, as has been the case with the multitude of hours invested in tobacco control efforts. At a clinical level, frameworks for patient-centered health communication have emerged that support the indispensable functions of conveying information, supporting decision-making, fostering healing relationships, enabling patient self-management, managing uncertainty, and responding to emotions. At the contextual level, advances in health communication technologies have extended the reach and cost-effectiveness of health communication interventions through just-in-time adaptive interventions; mobile, always available, communication response systems; structured decision-support architectures; and community-based platforms for local, targeted messaging, to name just a few. To realize the promise of this work, the field has expanded in its interdisciplinary reach. Schools of communication expand their reach by forging intellectual alliances with schools of psychology, computer technology, public health, medicine, sociology, anthropology, social work, and even business. Academic theoreticians contribute to the process by identifying the pathways, tested through hypothesis-driven discovery, by which health-related communications are perceived, internalized, and acted upon across audiences and populations. Methodologists and surveillance researchers contribute evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of different public health interventions to facilitate a self-correcting path toward greater communication coherence. Interventionists assume the indispensable responsibility for translating theoretical understanding and evidence-based approaches into efficacious and replicable programs. Professional opportunities in health communication now span the gamut from the university to the private sector to work within government and work within nongovernmental foundations and non-profits.

N2  - In this chapter, I will be discussing technology-based interventions for health promotion, disease management, and treatment, providing an overview of the field, including examples in practice and a description of the role of theory. I will also provide an overview of limitations and potential future research directions. As noted, technology-based interventions go by a variety of names (eHealth, mHealth, digital interventions, health apps, Internet-based interventions [IBIs], and they are broad and frequently evolving, in part due to the ever-changing nature of technology. Therefore, this chapter is not meant to encompass all available information related to technology-based interventions; it is instead meant to provide an overview, giving the reader an understanding of what technology-based interventions can offer and examples that have been used for health communication efforts in various topic areas. It should also be noted that much research on technology-based health interventions, including most of the information presented in this chapter, tends to be from the post-positivist paradigm. Other research, however, examines technology-based interventions from different frameworks. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - One important evidence-based component of early communication interventions in high-income countries is teaching parents and other primary caregivers to provide communication opportunities in daily activities to stimulate the development of beginning communication skills. To address some of the barriers to communication interventions for children with developmental disorders (DD) in rural South Africa, we developed a prototype Web-based self-guided app for caregivers to use at home with their children with DD who were at the beginning stages of communication development. The purpose of this study is to examine how this app intervention functioned for caregivers and its secondary effects on their children. Fifty-one caregiver-child dyads were randomly assigned to either a typical care intervention group (a 30-minute hospital-based intervention once a month) or the self-guided mobile health technology (MHT) app plus the typical care intervention. We assessed both the caregivers and their children. The majority of the 27 caregiver-child dyads (81%) assigned to the app group used the app and completed a mean of 35.8 sessions across the 48 sessions (mean range = 5.08-15.75). Eighty percent of these caregivers employed the "help" function of the app (M per caregiver = 9.89). The caregivers who completed 44-48 sessions reported that more than half of the children moved from pre-symbolic forms of communication (e.g., crying) to symbolic forms of communication (e.g., words) by the end of the intervention. Compared to the typical care group, the caregivers perceived that their children's success increased even though their difficulties remained stable. The app group showed a very modest gain in expressive language while the typical care group did not. The findings suggest that the self-guided app framework shows promise as a supplement to traditional monthly speech-language intervention in South Africa.

N2  - With the sudden transition to emergency remote instruction during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the examination of how online platforms and multimedia tools supported STEM educators and students is relevant and even urgent. This study documents how educators, despite limited prior training, rapidly developed, designed, and orchestrated their online course and captures their and their students' perceptions as they adapted to the virtual setting. The dissertation adds to the nascent body of literature on continuing education disrupted by disasters and civil crises.After developing a valid and reliable instrument measuring the extent to which educators and students were supported and satisfied with the emergency remote STEM environment, a pilot and national survey study of two groups followed. STEM educators (n= 109) - university teacher educators, pre-service teachers (PSTs), K-12 teachers, and 6th to 12th grade students (n=41) responded to the national survey. Additionally, twelve educators and four students were interviewed.Guided by the theoretical frameworks of boundary crossing and self-regulation learning, the data revealed tensions students faced as they struggled to complete assignments and adjusted to the reduced social presence of peers and teachers. Eight percent of the national study students remained "bored" and "uninterested" (11%). Additionally, 25% of the students did not want to take an online course in the future. The following themes emerged from the student interviews: (1) the desire for more regular, required, live, interactive sessions (2) the inclusion of motivating activities and collaborative experiences, and (3) personalized feedback rather than completion grades. Interviews with pre-service teachers (PST) demonstrated how a strong university teacher preparation program acts as a boundary spanner for transforming the identity of a teacher candidate to a recent graduate, certified and experienced with a virtual teaching internship. Support for PSTs came in the form of (1) teacher education emphasizing TPACK, (2) well-being check-ups from teacher educators, (3) frequent communication with the mentor teacher, and (4) opportunities for planning units, lessons, and preparing online materials, including the creation of instructional videos.The data also reflected emotional challenges teachers faced with creating boundaries between work and home. Interviews identified three categories of teachers, demonstrating either a low, medium, or high commitment level towards teaching in the new online setting. Achieving the high commitment level required a sense of responsibility, determination, and the ability to leverage boundary spanners such as PD trainings, social media, online repositories, and technological knowledgeable colleagues.Educator interviews reported disparities among students, underscoring the critical need for all education stakeholders to address the lack of access millions of students have to broadband service and technological devices. The study details teachers' empathy and heightened awareness of the psychological and economic pressures on their students, as well as how teachers supported ELLs and students with disabilities. Implications for practice include strategies respecting and valuing languages other than English in the STEM classroom, as well as being flexible with curriculum choices, software, and tools to best accommodate students with disabilities. Three models for motivating student participation emerged from the interviews: (1) Offering live optional office hours with incentives, (2) instituting themed meetings, and (3) envisioning live sessions as social spaces. Implementing variations of these models may help reduce the transactional distance between teachers-students and students-students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk of HIV globally. HIV rates among MSM in Europe show increasing trends, in contrast to declining trends in the general population. During the last five years, an increase in reported HIV cases among foreign-born MSM have been observed in Sweden. Representative data about the MSM population is difficult to collect due to lack of a sampling frame. Respondent driven sampling has been developed to access hidden groups and achieve high response rates. Online sampling methods such as Web-based Respondent driven sampling and stratified sampling in a Web community are new and innovative ways of reaching MSM. Aims: To systematically gather and review evidence for HIV prevention interventions among men who have sex with men in the European Union/European Economic Area and to test and evaluate different sampling methods to study sexual risk behaviour among Men who have sex with Men. Methods: A systematic review of HIV preventive interventions among MSM applying the Highest Available Standard of Evidence grading framework was performed to inform European guidelines. Web-based respondent driven sampling was implemented to study sexual risk behaviour and Internet use among MSM. Stratified sampling in a Web community was performed to study HIV testing and prevention uptake among foreign-born MSM living in Sweden. Finally, the samples of MSM in Sweden achieved through Web-based respondent driven sampling, stratified sampling in a Web community, time location sampling and online banner survey sampling, were compared regarding sociodemographics and sexual risk behaviour for HIV. Results: In total, twenty-four interventions were reviewed and fifteen interventions were graded to be strongly, probably or possibly recommended. Condom use, peer outreach, peerled groups, and universal coverage of antiretroviral treatment were found to be strongly recommended. Web-based respondent driven sampling generated a sample of MSM whom all reported unprotected anal intercourse with at least one casual and one regular sex partner in the past twelve months. Stratified sampling in a Web community produced a sub-sample of foreign-born MSM of which 45% had tested for HIV during the past twelve months. A fifth of participants had never tested. Having talked with a prevention worker in the last year was associated with having tested for HIV in the same time frame. The four different sampling strategies used to study sexual risk behaviour among MSM in Sweden captured participant samples that differed regarding sociodemographic characteristic and reported sexual behaviour. Conclusions: Condom use, peer outreach, peer-led groups, and universal coverage of antiretroviral treatment are evidence-based corner stones of HIV preventive interventions for MSM. Web-based respondent driven sampling reached MSM engaging in sexual risk behaviour and holds promise for online interventions and referrals to prevention programmes. To achieve higher uptake of HIV testing among foreign-born MSM in Sweden outreach programmes could be scaled up and evaluated. Future studies could benefit from using different sampling methods to achieve comprehensive data and validate findings across samples of MSM.

N2  - Background: Childhood overweight and obesity has increased significantly over the past two decades. Many well-conducted obesity prevention trials have been conducted in pre-school aged children but the majority have not been able to show changes in obesity related markers.These trials have used traditional face-to-face methods to conduct the interventions, which are expensive and difficult to scale up. Therefore, new dissemination methods for intervention studies such as mobile health (mHealth) should be explored. Aims: The overall aim of this thesis was to determine whether a mHealth intervention targeted towards parents could improve obesity markers in pre-school aged children.Paper I: To outline the study design and methodologies utilized in the MINISTOP trial.Paper II: To evaluate the validity of reported energy and food intake assessed using the mobile based Tool for Energy Balance in Children (TECH) against total energy expenditure(TEE) and 24hr dietary recalls, respectively.Paper III: To evaluate the capacity of the wrist-worn ActiGraph wGT3x-BT accelerometer to capture variations in free-living activity energy expenditure (AEE) and to assess wear compliance of the ActiGraph using a seven day 24hr protocol.Paper IV: To assess the effectiveness of the MINISTOP intervention on body composition,intakes of fruits, vegetables, candy, and sweetened beverages, as well as the amount of time spent sedentary and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity after the 6-month intervention.Paper V: To investigate if the MINISTOP intervention 12-months after baseline improved fatmass index (FMI) and had a maintained effect on a composite score (made up of FMI as wellas dietary and physical activity variables). MethodsPaper II: A nested validation study including 39 children aged 5.5 years. Energy and food intakes were measured using TECH and compared to TEE assessed using the doubly labelled water method and 24hr dietary recalls, respectively.Paper III: A nested validation study including 40 children aged 5.5 years. TEE was assessed using the doubly labelled water method and AEE was calculated as TEE minus a predicted basal metabolic rate. The ActiGraph was worn on the non-dominant wrist and the utilized outputs were mean of daily filtered vector magnitudes (mean VM total) and mean of awake filtered vector magnitudes (mean VM waking).Papers IV and V: A randomized controlled trial including 315 children aged 4.5 years. After baseline assessments, the children were randomly allocated into the intervention or control group for six months. The intervention group and control group received the MINISTOP appor a pamphlet on dietary and physical activity behaviors for pre-school children, respectively. The outcome measures were FMI (primary) and intakes of fruits, vegetables, candy, and sweetened beverages, as well as time spent sedentary and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (secondary). Two composite scores, a seven component (including all primary and secondary outcomes) and a six component (including only secondary outcomes) were computed.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: The implementation of research findings into practice is complex and challenging. Recurrent reports point to the failure of implementation and a costly gap between current knowledge and the services provided to end users. To overcome these challenges and to improve our understanding of implementation, it has been suggested that researchers make use of theory and study the change mechanisms that describe how and why implementation strategies influence outcomes in a specific context. Yet, such studies remain scarce. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate change mechanisms in implementation. This is done through a theoretically based analysis of how behavior change interventions(study I and II) and leadership style (study III) influence employees' initial (study I and III)and sustained (study II and III) use of a teamwork work process (study I and II) and an occupational health intervention (study III). Methods: Teamwork implementation was studied with a comparable case study design (study I), and teamwork sustainability was further studied with a design based on realistic evaluation(study II). Data were collected with interviews, observations and document analysis. Both studies used the theoretical framework DCOM to analyze behavior change interventions and observations of teamwork behaviors as the outcome. The influence of line managers' leadership style on implementation was investigated in a longitudinal intervention study(study III). Data were collected from questionnaire surveys at baseline and follow-up at 12 months. Employees' use of the web-based intervention was collected from electronic data logs and used as the outcome. Findings: An implementation strategy based on communication, daily feedback, ongoing problem-solving and adjustments to the teamwork intervention was found to be successful for the implementation of teamwork. The fallback in the implementation strategy had a negative influence on sustainability. The analysis describes how and why the implementation strategy influenced implementation outcomes in a complex organizational context. Line managers 'supportive change activities, which are directly related to the intervention implemented, had a significant influence on employees' initial and sustained use of the web-based occupational health intervention. The line managers' transformational leadership did not have a direct influence on use but an indirect influence mediated by their supportive change activities. Conclusions: The DCOM framework and realistic evaluation provided useful theoretical and methodological frameworks for the investigation and understanding of how the implementation strategy and contextual factors interact and cause behavior change. The findings imply that an implementation strategy should be based on a theoretical understanding of change mechanisms and an analysis of context to successfully influence behavior change. Furthermore, the findings points to the dynamics of context and suggests that context needs to be continuously updated and in turn used to guide updates to the implementation strategy. Finally, the thesis underlines the importance of line managers' dedicated focus on supportive change activities and challenges previous research suggesting that transformational leadership is the leadership style of choice for successful implementation.

N2  - As schools are increasingly tasked with improving student outcomes related to both academic and social and emotional wellbeing, digital interventions are becoming utilized as viable tools for successful outcomes. This study aimed to measure the effectiveness of a culturally responsive, art-based mindfulness intervention called L.A.U.G.H. (Let Art Unleash Great Happiness), in a diverse sample of 243 elementary school students. Using an iPad app, students practiced mindful breathing and created digital art in their classrooms. The app also measured students' moods, school connectedness, and joy of learning. The study design was a one-group repeated measure intervention design where ratings were compared between Weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 of the intervention. Results indicated that L.A.U.G.H. time improved and increased students' moods, School Connectedness, and Joy of Learning over time. Race played a significant role in how students rated their feelings about school, with significant effects that emerged among Black/African American and Asian American/Pacific Islander students. Both groups began with the lowest ratings of school connectedness and demonstrated significant improvements by Week 8. This study revealed results from a digital mindfulness intervention and highlighted the importance of a nuanced study of differential impacts of such interventions among diverse students.

N2  - Objective: This study explored consumers' perspectives on self-monitoring, a common feature in behavioral interventions that helps inform consumers' progress and answer their questions, to learn what outcome metrics matter to consumers and whether self-selection of these metrics leads to greater engagement (i.e., compliance, satisfaction) in self-monitoring than monitoring only default options. Methods: In a proof-of-concept randomized trial, 48 adult participants were randomly assigned to "clinician-determined monitoring" or "clinician + self-determined monitoring" conditions. Before starting monitoring, all participants shared outcomes that would matter to them in a mobile intervention for binge eating and weight management. Then, for 3 weeks, participants in the "clinician-determined" condition monitored their weight and binge-eating episodes, and participants in the "clinician + self-determined" condition monitored these and another metric of their choosing. After, satisfaction and compliance were assessed. Results: Participants identified 116 metrics, grouped into 12 themes, that mattered to them. During monitoring, participants in the "clinician + self-determined" condition monitored 41 metrics. Surprisingly, participants in the "clinician-determined" condition also monitored metrics besides weight and binge eating. This resulted in a failure of our experimental manipulation, which represents a significant limitation of this research. No significant differences emerged in satisfaction or compliance between conditions. Discussion: Although our proof-of-concept trial yielded null quantitative results, findings also suggested binge eating and weight management interventions may benefit from including an individually customizable monitoring option in addition to default metrics, warranting testing in future research. Public Significance: Examining consumers' self-monitoring preferences for a mobile intervention for binge eating and weight management revealed a variety of metrics that matter to consumers, although binge eating and weight were still most valued. Findings from our proof-of-concept trial suggest design implications of encouraging an individually customizable monitoring option, in addition to default metrics, which needs to be tested in future research over a longer period and during actual mobile intervention delivery.

N2  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact of a tele-guided digital-based intervention based on the addictive appetite model of recurrent binge eating. Method: Female college students with bulimia nervosa (BN) or binge-eating disorder (BED) (n = 22) received a 6-week guided intervention targeting addictive processes and emotion regulation. The feasibility of the intervention was evaluated, and the outcomes were assessed at baseline, the end of the intervention, and 1-month follow-up. Results: Of the participants, 86.4% (n = 19) completed the intervention. The self-help materials were viewed 6.03 +/- 3.06 times per week, and the duration of using the self-help materials was 113.16 +/- 160.19 min/week. The intervention group experienced a significant reduction with a moderate effect on binge eating at the end of the intervention (Hedges' g = 0.58), and the effects lasted through follow-up (Hedges' g = 0.82). Discussion: The results suggest that the digital intervention targeting a maintenance mechanism of recurrent binge eating was feasible and acceptable for patients with BN and BED, proving the potential for symptom improvement. Public significance: The addictive appetite model provides the framework for new interventions to improve treatments for BN and BED. This study found that the digital intervention based on the model was feasible and acceptable for patients with BN and BED. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Few studies have investigated the impact of web-based physical activity interventions on mental health outcomes. Therefore, this study examined the impact of a web-based personally tailored physical activity intervention on depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life. Methods: 501 participants were randomised into either a control group or a pooled intervention condition who received a 3-month web-based personally tailored physical activity intervention. Previously, this intervention has demonstrated to improve self-reported physical activity, but not device-measured physical activity. At baseline, 3- and 9-months, depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the DASS21, and quality of life was assessed using the SF-12V2. General linear mixed models examined differences between groups over time. Results: Most participants (> 80%) reported normal levels of depression, anxiety or stress. Relative to baseline levels, significant reductions of depression, anxiety, stress and the SF12 mental health component were observed in the pooled intervention group at 3 and 9 months. Relative to the control group, significant reductions were observed in the pooled intervention group for depression and stress (3-months only) and anxiety (3- and 9-months), but not quality of life. Conclusion: A web-based physical activity intervention can result in positive mental health outcomes, even in the absence of device-measured physical activity improvements. However, these findings need to be confirmed in future studies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Background: Early warning signs monitoring by service users with schizophrenia has shown promise in preventing relapse but the quality of evidence is low. We aimed to establish the feasibility of undertaking a definitive randomised controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a blended digital intervention for relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Methods: This multicentre, feasibility, cluster randomised controlled trial aimed to compare Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER) with treatment as usual in community mental health services (CMHS) in Glasgow and Melbourne. CMHS were the unit of randomisation, selected on the basis of those that probably had five or more care coordinators willing to participate. Participants were eligible if they were older than 16 years, had a schizophrenia or related diagnosis confirmed via case records, were able to provide informed consent, had contact with CMHS, and had had a relapse within the previous 2 years. Participants were randomised within stratified clusters to EMPOWER or to continue their usual approach to care. EMPOWER blended a smartphone for active monitoring of early warning signs with peer support to promote self-management and clinical triage to promote access to relapse prevention. Main outcomes were feasibility, acceptability, usability, and safety, which was assessed through face-to-face interviews. App usage was assessed via the smartphone and self-report. Primary end point was 12 months. Participants, research assistants and other team members involved in delivering the intervention were not masked to treatment conditions. Assessment of relapse was done by an independent adjudication panel masked to randomisation group. The study is registered at ISRCTN (99559262). Findings: We identified and randomised eight CMHS (six in Glasgow and two in Melbourne) comprising 47 care coordinators. We recruited 86 service users between Jan 19 and Aug 8, 2018; 73 were randomised (42 [58%] to EMPOWER and 31 [42%] to treatment as usual). There were 37 (51%) men and 36 (49%) women. At 12 months, main outcomes were collected for 32 (76%) of service users in the EMPOWER group and 30 (97%) of service users in the treatment as usual group. Of those randomised to EMPOWER, 30 (71%) met our a priori criterion of more than 33% adherence to daily monitoring that assumed feasibility. Median time to discontinuation of these participants was 31.5 weeks (SD 14.5). There were 29 adverse events in the EMPOWER group and 25 adverse events in the treatment as usual group. There were 13 app-related adverse events, affecting 11 people, one of which was serious. Fear of relapse was lower in the EMPOWER group than in the treatment as usual group at 12 months (mean difference -7.53 (95% CI -14.45 to 0.60; Cohen's d -0.53). Interpretation: A trial of digital technology to monitor early warning signs blended with peer support and clinical triage to detect and prevent relapse appears to be feasible, safe, and acceptable. A further main trial is merited. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Presented here are the results of a series of three studies focused on the need, validation, and improvement of hEAR, a mobile hearing screening application. The first study was a systematic review of 37 peer-reviewed studies to assess the efficacy of different types of audiology mHealth interventions, especially in high-risk populations. Four main modes of technology used to deliver the mHealth intervention were identified, out of which remote computing was found to be most effective. Smartphone applications were found to be as efficacious, but the results were dependent on the population characteristics. The study resulted in demonstrating the need for hEAR in high risk populations. The purpose of the second study was to validate headphone hardware for use with hEAR, when compared to a pure tone audiometric test. Both hEAR and the audiologist's test used 7 frequencies (independent variable), 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz and 8000 Hz, and the recorded measurements were sound pressure levels (dependent variable) measured in decibels. Participants (30) from Texas A&M University were recruited based on a screener, and were randomly assigned and counterbalanced to one of two groups, differing in the order the hEAR tests and the audiologist's test were administered. Data were analyzed using a generalized estimating equation model at alpha=0.05, which showed that Pioneer headphones, were comparably similar to the audiologist's test at all frequencies. The third study was a multi-method assessment of hEAR based on user-centered design principles. Six nurses and thirty students from the Bryan Independent School District were recruited and the assessments were conducted at the participants' schools. Nurses used hEAR to screen their students, after which the nurses filled out two questionnaires: The System Usability Scale and the After-Scenario Questionnaire. The time taken to complete the tasks, as well as the number of errors committed were also observed. The nurses participated in individual in-depth interviews. The result of the assessments revealed 8 problems that the nurses encountered during their use of hEAR, which were then grouped into 4 usability themes to derive user-centered design recommendations for similar mHealth applications.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to explore perceptions of the Digital Twin (a three-dimensional digital representation of an anatomical body) on a mobile health application, and the potential mechanisms that are important for behaviour change, with a focus on health and weight management. An explorative and participant-led approach was taken using semi-structured online interviews to explore the experiences of people, in this case non-users and users wanting to independently manage their health. An opportunity sample of forty participants from the United Kingdom (20 who had not used digitally assistive technology and 20 who had) were recruited from social media platforms (22 females and 18 males; mean age was 30). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Two main themes were elicited: Initiators of behaviour change (i.e., autonomous choices, social influences, and personalisation) and Barriers to behaviour change (i.e., adverse reactions, weight management norms and negative attitudes). Overall, it was suggested that the Digital Twin should be representative of a user's personalised health information and BMI. These results can inform an intervention designed to use the Digital Twin to initiate and maintain lifestyle behaviour change. It can also develop our understanding of how such technology can be applied as a tool for health management. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The transition to adult primary care can be difficult and stressful for adolescents and young adults with special healthcare needs (AYA-SHCN) to navigate, increasing the risk for poor health outcomes. Current healthcare systems do not have sufficient capacity to deliver transition support to AYA-SHCN, but mobile health (mHealth) interventions could provide education and counseling to patients in a less resource-intensive manner than clinic encounters. We share our experience using human-centered design principles to co-create an mHealth intervention to support AYA-SHCN, in partnership with a bilingual Spanish-English family advisory board. We followed the Information Systems Research Framework, consisting of three cycles: 1) relevance, to understand the lived experience and needs of the end-user, 2) rigor, to integrate scientific knowledge into the development process, and 3) design, to specify features of a new intervention.

T1  - Reminding me of the future: Episodic future thinking as a strategy for mobile health interventions.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2022//
N2  - The use of mobile and wireless technologies has been rapidly increasing worldwide and sparked a growth in the use of these technologies to support the achievement of health objectives (i.e., mHealth). This dissertation aims to test the effect of an mHealth intervention using mobile apps for promoting healthy lifestyle behavior change among college students. It takes an "active ingredient" perspective that examines the utility of a single strategy in mHealth interventions. The strategy is called episodic future thinking (EFT), the ability to project oneself into the future to pre-experience future events. Drawing on future thinking, intertemporal choice, and construal level theory, this dissertation proposes that engaging in EFT (vs. episodic recent thinking, ERT) could help individuals make better health-related choices in their everyday lives in terms of taking sufficient sleep or physical activity. Through a two-week mHealth intervention using the health apps SleepCycle and NikeTrainingClub, this dissertation examines the effect of EFT on two lifestyle-related behaviors, i.e., sleep and physical activity participation, and explores the psychological mechanism underlying EFT's effect. The findings suggest that EFT could be a useful strategy incorporated into mHealth interventions to increase intentions for health behavior change and to promote actual behavior change among college students. However, it might have contradictory effects when applied to different types of behavior. Specific to the current study, EFT was effective in promoting physical activity as recorded through the health app NikeTrainingClub. However, EFT had negative effect when applied to the sleep behavior. The reasons why this was the case are explained and theoretical and practical implications for EFT research and mHealth interventions are discussed. In general, the findings complement and extend previous research on EFT and mHealth interventions and emphasize the importance of context (including the context of mobile technologies) in mHealth intervention research.

N2  - Background: Chinese young adults experience barriers to mental health treatment, including the lack of treatment providers and stigma around treatment seeking. Evidence-based digital mental health interventions are promising and scalable alternatives to face-to-face treatment for this population, but lack rigorous evidence to support scale-up in China. Aim: The study was a feasibility study for a large-scale RCT of Step-by-Step, a behavioral activation-based, mental health intervention to address depression and anxiety symptoms in Chinese young adults. It sought to assess feasibility of recruitment and of delivery of Step-by-Step in a University setting, to assess acceptability of the intervention, and to examine potential effectiveness. Method: An uncontrolled, feasibility trial was conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Chinese Step-by-Step for Chinese University students with elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores at or above 10) in Macao, China. Data was collected at two different time points (i.e., baseline and 8-weeks after baseline), administered via questionnaires embedded in an interventional mobile application. Participation rate and dropout rate were measured. Depressive and anxiety symptom severity, well-being, and self-defined stress were assessed. Satisfaction with the program was assessed using qualitative interviews. Results: A total of 173 students were screened, 22.0% (n = 38) were eligible, and 63.2% of them (n = 24) started the intervention. The dropout rate by post-test was 45.8%. Results from completers showed that Step-by-Step was potentially effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptom severity, and self-defined stress. Students were generally satisfied with the program, but also offered suggestions for continued improvement. Qualitative feedback was reported within the RE-AIM framework, covering recruitment, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Amendments to the program were made according to the feedback (e.g., adding notification for new session, modify the time zone). Conclusion: A minimally guided Step-by-Step protocol and the study procedure were successfully pilot tested for use for Chinese University students. The intervention was acceptable and no adverse events were reported. The results support the potential effectiveness and feasibility of a large-scale evaluation of the program.

N2  - Technological renaissance of the last century stimulated the application of digital interventions in the healthcare domain. Digital healthcare interventions (DHIs) could be implemented through smartphone applications (apps), remote monitoring and tracking devices, and wearable computers. Technology is positioned to transform how mental healthcare is delivered and accessed. In fact, remote active and passive monitoring of parameters, such as mood, activity, and sleep, could be integrated with therapeutic interventions. However, the transformation entails combined conscription of science, regulation, and design. Implementation, adoption, and evaluation of DHI present special challenges. This chapter presents brief history of DHIs in mental health and frameworks an evaluation strategy in terms of the appropriate methods required for appraisal of DHIs.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Many African American Pentecostal parishioners are unable to lead fully productive lives due to overwhelming exposure to one or more human challenges leading to holistic dispossession. Pastoral leaders have a big responsibility in assisting parishioners as they seek to be relieved from this condition. A lack of preparation and educational advancement may interfere with a pastoral leader's ability to carry out that responsibility. For the purpose of creating framework for this hypothesis, this project explored a parishioner's quest for holistic health and wellness using Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)'s The Eight Dimensions of Wellness model as framework to identify eight base-line problem areas. Supplemental strategies from theological and biblical paradigms, and secular disciplines were recommended for optimizing health and wellness in the most problematic areas. Five men and five women, ages 30-85, participated in the cross-sectional study. The findings from the pre-curriculum self-assessment interview showed that three of the eight dimensions of wellness were found to be at critically low levels; indicating the need for immediate intervention and treatment. The remaining five dimensions were rated at average to high levels with no significant risks linked to holistic dispossession. A post-curriculum questionnaire was also administered to assess impact and sustainability. The results of this study and data collection implies a need for educational advancement and preventive health education among African American Pentecostal Church leaders and seek to uncover strategies for making the leader's role more equitable in the life of every parishioner who suffers from any form of holistic dispossession.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - The rates of mental illness among African American women are comparable to the general population, however, they significantly underutilize mental health services compared to their white counterparts. Previous studies revealed that mHealth interventions increase access to mental health services and resources, and are effective in reducing anxiety and depression. Approximately 80% of African American women own smartphones. This presents a great opportunity to use mobile technology to help reduce the disparity in mental health service utilization and improve health outcomes.The purpose of this dissertation study is to examine the attitudes and perceptions of African American women towards using mental health services, and the feasibility of using mobile technology to deliver mental health services and resources. Eligible participants were African American women (>= 18 years of age). Participants were recruited through convenience sampling methods (e.g., social media) to complete a web-based survey (n=395), participate in a focus group (4 groups of 5 participants), or test and evaluate a mental health app developed to help African American women manage anxiety and depression (n=15). Results from the study revealed that African American women have favorable views toward seeking mental health services. However, respondents identified many barriers to seeking treatment. Most of the barriers were related to cost, not knowing where to get services, lack of time, and concern of stigma. Findings from the study showed that respondents were more comfortable with using voice call or video call when compared with text messaging or use of a mobile app to communicate with mental health professionals for help in managing anxiety and depression. User-centered recommendations focused on the type of content (e.g., information to find a Black female therapist) and features (e.g., group chat rooms) that should be included in an app culturally-tailored for African American women. Suggestions to increase app usage (e.g., ability to learn coping techniques) and establish trust (e.g., transparency on how user data is protected) were also discussed. The findings of this study demonstrated the need for additional research into the use of mobile technology to provide African American women with more accessible and convenient options for mental health care.

N2  - Mobile technologies have become increasingly pervasive and integral in our daily lives. A growing number of mobile applications are focused on health applications with many specifically focused on helping the prevention, treatment, and management of mental health issues. These apps are slowly being introduced into clinical settings, either being brought in by clients who themselves are using these tools or by health systems or providers. Unfortunately, most practicing providers obtained their clinical training before the advent of mobile health tools and methods. Thus, a critical need exists to develop and disseminate resources to develop the essential skills needed to adopt mobile health techniques. We discuss the five core competencies in mobile health care: evidence, integration, security and privacy, ethics, and cultural considerations. Although this paper will not fully prepare a provider to use mobile apps in their practice, it provides an introduction that will helpfully guide a provider to additional resources and additional ways to develop these competencies. Finally, we discuss the future directions of the field, including a growing differentiation of the impact of mobile apps on clinical care and the need for training models and experiences to match this differentiation.

N2  - Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of administering the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) through the internet, with major implications for promoting inclusivity in research participation. However, online TSST studies to date are limited by a lack of control groups and the need for biological measures of stress reactivity that can be fully implemented online. Here, we test smartphone-based photoplethysmography as a measure of heart rate reactivity to an online variant of the TSST. Results demonstrate significant acceleration in heart rate and heightened self-reported stress and anxiety in the TSST condition relative to a placebo version of the TSST. The placebo condition led to a significant increase in self-reported stress and anxiety relative to baseline levels, but this increase was smaller in magnitude than that observed in the TSST condition. These findings highlight the potential for smartphone-based photoplethysmography in internet-delivered studies of cardiac reactivity and demonstrate that it is critical to utilize random assignment to a control or stressor condition when administering acute stress online.

N2  - Background: With greying of nations, dementia becomes a public health priority. The rising dementia prevalence escalates both health care expenses and burden, placing the entire healthcare system and caregivers under huge stress. Cognition-oriented interventions have been shown to enhance the overall cognitive performance among healthy and cognitively impaired older adults. Objective: This article is assumed to be a steppingstone for the introduction and establishment of cognition- oriented interventions in Egypt. In addition, it aims to offer provisional guidance for health care providers in Arab speaking countries in a stepwise approach in order to establish cognition-oriented intervention services and help them to evaluate and monitor their efficacy. Methods: A consortium of Egyptian and Greek specialists developed a protocol for the operations of the Ain Shams Cognitive Training Lab and the provision of cognition-oriented interventions. This protocol is based on a previous successful protocol that has been implemented in Greece for more than 10 years and is co-designed to fit the needs of older adults in Arabic speaking countries. Results: The types of services offered, their objectives, recruitment of participants, delivery of interventions, measurement of outcomes and privacy policy are all outlined in the policy. Conclusion: Establishing the appropriate framework in which cognitive training strategies can be adapted and implemented in Arabic population, constitutes an inevitable achievement in healthy ageing and can be also assumed as a dementia prevention strategy. Moreover, setting up the first cognitive laboratory in Egypt older adults, can be a model of good practice across the Arabic countries. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mobile technologies represent potentially novel and scalable intervention delivery platforms for adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a prospective, mixed methods pilot study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the WhatsApp platform to deliver individual counseling services and facilitate peer support for ALWH in western Kenya. Thirty ALWH (17 female, mean age 15.4) on ART, engaged in HIV care and aware of their status, were enrolled. After 6 months, participants described their experiences with the intervention. Treatment adherence, stigma, and mental and behavioral health were assessed prospectively. Participants reported overall positive experiences and indicated that the platform encouraged peer network development. They endorsed potential benefits for treatment adherence, stigma reduction, and mental and behavioral health. All participants supported intervention expansion. In western Kenya, WhatsApp was an acceptable and feasible platform for mobile counseling and peer support for ALWH. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Traditional self-compassion-based interventions have been shown to be beneficial for improving psychological health. With the development of technology, online interventions accessible via smart phones start to emerge. The current study aimed to use daily assessments to investigate the effect of online daily self-compassion interventions and its improvement pattern. Sixty-five employees were recruited and completed a 4-week study. The first week was the control period; the second week and the third week were the intervention period and the fourth week was the follow-up period. Online self-compassion meditation significantly improved daily self-compassion and reduced perceived stress and emotional exhaustion, with varied changing patterns. Daily self-compassion and perceived stress did not change in the control period, then started to increase/decline with time during the intervention period, and remained stable in the follow-up period. Daily emotional exhaustion declined with time in the control period and remained stable in the intervention and follow-up period. The intervention effects did not differ for individuals with different levels of trait self-compassion. This study shows that daily online self-compassion meditation is effective and reveals how it works. Future studies can apply this method to examine the effectiveness of other daily online interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This book begins with a discussion of Abilify MyCite's approval because the discourse surrounding its release exemplifies this book's foremost problematic: technologies, in various forms, are believed to be solutions to the United States' ongoing mental health crisis. It should be understood as more than merely a study of those technologies which claim to improve user mental health. It is also a study of faith in technology and a demonstration of why that faith is misplaced. The question one should be asking is not how might one create technologies capable of solving the mental healthcare crisis, but rather what do mental health technologies reveal about beliefs and practices related to the self, medicine, and culture? The book responds to that query by demonstrating that mental health technologies are an outgrowth of a neoliberal ethos of care, perpetuating hegemonic ideals of individual responsibilization while also demanding their users enact new forms of labor, participate in new types of surveillance, and adopt entrepreneurial attitudes toward their own mental healthiness. The book argues that mental health's technologization reflects new and troubling expansions of neoliberalism. It is in this context that the self, understood as the mind, is believed to be not only malleable but also a site apt for perpetual self-improvement. The mind and its relative healthiness (or unhealthiness) are also no longer matters of private concern. Instead the mind's interconnectedness with economic systems and global futures renders it part of a complex web of beliefs and practices that both reflect and perpetuate the individuation of responsibility through new technologies. The book concludes with what the title a "COVID Coda", wherein it discusses how the global COVID-19 pandemic made many of the issues related to mental health, technology, and the continued marginalization of persons in need of mental healthcare services.

T1  - Alleviating the harm: A media literacy intervention for body dissatisfaction using ecological momentary intervention.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Objective: Body dissatisfaction rates continue to remain high and the consequences remain dire, especially among young women. One sociocultural factor found to contribute to body dissatisfaction is media use. Traditional media literacy interventions have found some success in decreasing body image-related constructs, though are limited in their reach and are often quickly outdated. This study developed and examined a media literacy intervention delivered via a smartphone app designed to help college women disrupt connection between media use and body dissatisfaction and negative affect. Method: Participants included 94 University of Hawai'i students, randomly assigned to the intervention group, the app-based control group, or the traditional control group. Participants using the app received 5 prompts per day for 15 days. The app-based control group self-monitored while the intervention group both self-monitored and received prompts providing psychoeducation and activities designed to increase media literacy. Assessment measures were collected at baseline and again 15 days later. Results: The intervention produced significant improvements in the intervention group compared to the control group on measures of fatigue. There were also overall reductions over time in general negative affect, fear, sadness, guilt, hostility, shyness, general positive affect, joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness, serenity and critical thinking about media messages that were not specific to condition. Feedback questions gathered at follow-up from the intervention group showed that participants rated the intervention as acceptable. Additionally, participants endorsed learning more about the link between the media ideals and body image. Discussion: This study provides evidence in support of the feasibility of delivering a media literacy intervention via a smartphone application. Participation in the study found significant decreases in types of affect, such as general negative affect, general positive affect, and sadness from baseline to post-intervention. However, there may be potential for greater change. Study limitations such as power and challenges with the smartphone application are discussed. Future directions related to the creation of digital interventions are discussed. Overall, participants rated the intervention as acceptable, opening the door for future research in which the intervention and its delivery system are improved, and its efficacy is reexamined.

N2  - This article discusses Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) as an innovative approach to enhancing child and adolescent mental health services. Patient electronic health records (EHRs) are readily available to practitioners but rarely provide adequate insight into complex clinical situations intrinsic to psychiatric care, including how best to address newly developed biological frameworks for disorders, emerging methods for phenotyping symptoms, and identifying syndromes. A CDSS can offer evidence-based guidance by using practice parameters, standardized guidelines, evolving scientific literature, and/or data sets compiled from actual experience, assembled in a scalable informatics framework. Essentially, a CDSS accesses large amounts of information and then uses algorithms for matching patient conditions and phenotypic patterns to the most relevant recommendations, so as to provide the most pertinent information and alternative actions, at each step in the clinical decision-making process. A CDSS is not a replacement for practitioners. It is designed to offer practitioners optimal, individualized, real-time support. A CDSS allows practitioners to apply compiled evidence so that each patient receives efficient, effective, and customized care at every encounter. CDSSs are opportunistic, technological innovations that aggregate evidence-based care and valuable clinical wisdom in order to diagnose, prevent, and treat psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.

N2  - Aging adults experience a disproportionate number of health-related problems. We applied a technological capital framework to assess how participation in web-delivered interventions is influenced by resources, perceived support, technology skills, and an overall environment conducive to making a change. Specifically, we conducted an in-depth examination of the uses and attitudes regarding online health information technologies among 41 middle-aged and older adults ('digital immigrants'). Situated in a six-year community ethnography, this qualitative study identifies potential barriers confronting middle-aged and older adults' engagement with online interventions and extends existing work on the four factors comprising technological capital (awareness, knowledge, access, and technological capacity). We found six major themes related to ICT use: literacy, comfort, adoption willingness, infrastructure, information security, and support availability. We provide evidence-based recommendations for overcoming barriers, and recommendations for assessing and teaching information technology skills across the lifespan without being ageist.

N2  - Technology-delivered interventions have the potential to help address the treatment gap in mental health care but are plagued by high attrition. Adding coaching, or minimal contact with a nonspecialist provider, may encourage engagement and decrease dropout, while remaining scalable. Coaching has been studied in interventions for various mental health conditions but has not yet been tested with anxious samples. This study describes the development of and reactions to a low-intensity coaching protocol administered to N = 282 anxious adults identified as high risk to drop out of a web-based cognitive bias modification for interpretation intervention. Undergraduate research assistants were trained as coaches and communicated with participants via phone calls and synchronous text messaging. About half of the sample never responded to coaches' attempts to schedule an initial phone call or did not answer the call, though about 30% completed the full intervention with their coach. Some anxious adults may choose technology-delivered interventions specifically for their lack of human contact and may fear talking to strangers on the phone; future recommendations include taking a more intensive user-centered design approach to creating and implementing a coaching protocol, allowing coaching support to be optional, and providing users with more information about how and why the intervention works.

N2  - Increasing the saliency of existing sources of meaning and purpose in life could be a practicalfocus area for innovative wellbeing interventions. This randomised controlled study aimed to assess the impact of a brief seven-day technology-based intervention on meaning in life, life satisfaction, and affect compared to a waitlist control group. A mobile phone application was used to deliver daily activities and momentary reflection questions. Significant improvements where observed in the presence of meaning in life (p = .02, eta2 = .05), life satisfaction (p = .00, eta2 = .08) and positive affect (p = .02, eta2 = 0.05) for the intervention versus the control group. Ecological momentary assessment data found increases in life satisfaction and meaning in life (b = 0.044, p = .041) and shed insight into activities that fostered fulfillment. These findings pave the way for future meaning and purpose interventions to build mental health and well-being. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Sexual minority women (SMW) disproportionately engage in heavy drinking and shoulder the burden of alcohol dependence. Much research has emphasized the need for culturally tailored alcohol interventions for this population, highlighting sexual minority stigma-related experiences, maladaptive coping, and misperceived peer drinking and coping norms as potential intervention targets. Focusing on the latter, this research examines the potential utility of personalized normative feedback (PNF) in reducing consumption among moderate and heavy drinking SMW. PNF is a popular, evidence-based intervention strategy associated with reliable (albeit modest) reductions in alcohol use in other heavy drinking populations. To remedy limitations associated with traditional PNF intervention formats and tailor this strategy to reflect the interests, social identities, and stigma experiences of SMW, a novel gamified intervention format was developed wherein PNF on drinking and coping behaviors was organically delivered to SMW within LezParlay, a larger competition designed to challenge negative stereotypes about lesbian, bisexual, queer (LBQ) women and increase the visibility of community members. The current study evaluates the efficacy and feasibility of this approach.In total, 2,677 LBQ women between the ages of 21 and 65 years signed up to take part in the LezParlay competition, with players logging over 44,0000 web app page views. Following several rounds of play, a sub-sample of 499 moderate-to-heavy drinking SMW were randomized to receive 1 of 3 sequences of PNF (i.e., alcohol+coping, alcohol+control, or control topics only) over two subsequent rounds. Alcohol use was assessed prior to randomization and two months post-intervention, along with potential demographic and sexual minority stigma-related moderators. Following the competition, these participants completed feedback surveys assessing acceptability, perceived benefits, and ideas for future versions of LezParlay.At follow-up, participants who received alcohol+coping and alcohol+control PNF significantly reduced their alcohol consumption relative to those who received control PNF only (d =.49 -.50). No differences were observed between treatment conditions overall; however, moderator analyses revealed alcohol+coping PNF to be more effective than alcohol only PNF among SMW who entered the study as heavier drinkers. Interpersonal stigma exposure also moderated intervention efficacy with enhanced effects observed among SMW in both treatment conditions reporting greater (relative to lesser) violence and harassment due to sexual minority status. Study participants found the competition to be highly acceptable and 93% reported psychological benefits, which most frequently included stigma reduction, social comparison, community connection, entertainment, self-confrontation, and mood enhancement. Findings support the feasibility and efficacy of this palatable approach to alcohol intervention for SMW, suggest that culturally tailored game mechanics may bolster PNF intervention engagement and potentially carry psychological benefits beyond core intervention content, and illuminate several priority directions for future research. Foremost, as findings suggest that PNF may particularly risk-reducing in the context of severe interpersonal stigma experiences like violence and harassment due to sexual minority status, additional research with SMW and members of other stigmatized groups is needed to more extensively examine potential interactions between norm correcting PNF and sexual minority stigma experiences in the context of heavy drinking and other health-risk behaviors. More broadly, this research advances several new directions for PNF intervention research, demonstrates the efficiency of hybrid feasibility/efficacy trial designs for evaluating digital health interventions, and illuminates the potential utility of incognito digital health intervention formats for nonclinical populations.

N2  - Objective: Irregular sleep-wake patterns are associated with poor health outcomes. However, factors that lead individuals to adopt more regular sleep-wake patterns are not well understood. This study aimed to (i) examine the relationship between sleep regularity and attitudes toward sleep in undergraduates; (ii) test an intervention to improve sleep regularity based on personalized feedback; and (iii) investigate whether changes in attitudes toward sleep associate with improved sleep regularity. Methods: Sleep-wake timing of 45 students (19.7 +/- 1.8 years) was monitored daily over two weeks using an app-based diary. The least regular sleepers, calculated using the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI <= 81.4; N = 22), completed a four-week randomized control intervention (RCI) designed to improve sleep regularity. The Charlotte Attitudes Toward Sleep (CATS) scale was administered at baseline and post-RCI, with subscales measuring attitudes toward sleep as a time commitment (Time), and as a beneficial/enjoyable behavior (Benefits). Results: CATS Time was positively associated with SRI at baseline (r2 = 0.16, p =.006) and during the four-week RCI (r2 = 0.29, p =.01). CATS Benefits was not associated with SRI but was associated with sleep quality. There was no significant improvement in SRI during the intervention. The relationship between change in CATS Time and change in SRI (baseline vs. RCI) differed between intervention and control groups (r2 = 0.27, p =.03). Conclusions: Attitudes toward sleep as a time commitment are associated with sleep regularity and should be considered as a target in future interventions aiming to improve sleep regularity.

N2  - Background: Poor self-management of heart failure (HF) contributes to devastating health consequences. Our innovative sensor-controlled digital game (SCDG) integrates data from sensors to trigger game rewards, progress, and feedback based on the real-time behaviors of individuals with HF. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare daily weight monitoring and physical activity behavior adherence by older adults using an SCDG intervention versus a sensors-only intervention in a feasibility randomized controlled trial. Methods: English-speaking adults with HF aged 55 years or older who owned a smartphone and could walk unassisted were recruited from Texas and Oklahoma from November 2019 to August 2020. Both groups were given activity trackers and smart weighing scales to track behaviors for 12 weeks. The feasibility outcomes of recruitment, retention, intervention engagement, and satisfaction were assessed. In addition to daily weight monitoring and physical activity adherence, the participants'knowledge, functional status, quality of life, self-reported HF behaviors, motivation to engage in behaviors, and HF-related hospitalization were also compared between the groups at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Results: A total of 38 participants with HF-intervention group (IG; 19/38, 50%) and control group (CG; 19/38, 50%)-were enrolled in the study. Of the 38 participants, 18 (47%) were women, 18 (47%) were aged 65 years or older, 21 (55%) had been hospitalized with HF in the past 6 months, and 29 (76%) were White. Furthermore, of these 38 participants, 31 (82%)-IG (15/19, 79%) and CG (16/19, 84%)-had both weight monitoring and physical activity data at the end of 12 weeks, and 27 (71%)-IG (14/19, 74%) and CG (13/19, 68%)-participated in follow-up assessments at 24 weeks. For the IG participants who installed the SCDG app (15/19, 79%), the number of days each player opened the game app was strongly associated with the number of days the player engaged in weight monitoring (r = 0.72; P = .04) and the number of days with physical activity step data (r = 0.9; P < .001). The IG participants who completed the satisfaction survey (13/19, 68%) reported that the SCDG was easy to use. Trends of improvement in daily weight monitoring and physical activity in the IG, as well as within-group improvements in HF functional status, quality of life, knowledge, self-efficacy, and HF hospitalization in both groups, were observed in this feasibility trial. Conclusions: Playing an SCDG on smartphones was feasible and acceptable for older adults with HF for motivating daily weight monitoring and physical activity. A larger efficacy trial of the SCDG intervention will be needed to validate trends of improvement in daily weight monitoring and physical activity behaviors.

N2  - Background: The efficacy of digital technology in improving diabetes management has typically been demonstrated through studies such as randomized controlled trials, which have reported a steeper reduction in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values for patients who adopted a digital solution. However, evidence from real-world clinical practice is still limited. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital interventions by tracking HbA1c improvements over 1 year in real-world clinical settings. Methods: Patients used the Health2Sync mobile app to track self-measured outcomes and communicate with health care professionals (HCPs). HCPs used the web-based Patient Management Platform to monitor patient data, view test results from clinical laboratories, and communicate with patients. Patients who have been onboarded for at least 13 months and have consecutive HbA1c findings for 5 quarters were included in the analysis. They were then stratified into 3 groups (high, mid, and low retention) based on their level of use of Health2Sync in the first 6 months of onboarding. A mixed model was built to compare the slopes of the rate of reduction in HbA1c among the groups. In addition, these patients' retention on the app from the seventh to the 12th month was verified through multiple comparisons. Results: A sample of 2036 users was included in the analysis. With the mixed model coefficient estimates, we found that app users had significant HbA1c percentage reductions as the passed quarter count increased (t=-9.869; P<.001), and that effectiveness increased in the high (t=-5.173) and mid retention (t=-6.620) groups as the interaction effects were significantly negative compared to that in the low retention group (P<.001) in the passed quarter count. The low retention group also had the highest average HbA1c value at the end of 13 months (high: 7.01%, SD 1.02%; mid: 6.99%, SD 1.00%; low: 7.17%, SD 1.14%) (Bonferroni correction: high vs low, P=.07; mid vs low, P=.02; high vs mid, P>.99). The level of use of the app remained consistent in the seventh to the 12th month after onboarding (high: 5.23 [SD 1.37] months, mid: 2.43 [SD 1.68] months, low: 0.41 [SD 0.97] months) (P<.001). Conclusions: Our analysis shows that continuous usage of the diabetes management app is associated with better glycemic control in real-world clinical practice. Further studies are required to reveal the efficacy for specific diabetes types and to observe effects beyond 1 year. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: People experiencing homelessness have higher rates of HIV than those who are stably housed. Mental health needs, substance use problems, and issues unique to homelessness such as lack of shelter and transiency need to be considered with regard to HIV prevention. To date, HIV prevention interventions for young adults experiencing homelessness have not specifically addressed modifiable real-time factors such as stress, sexual or drug use urge, or substance use, or been delivered at the time of heightened risk. Real-time, personalized HIV prevention messages may reduce HIV risk behaviors. Objective: This pilot study tested the initial efficacy of an innovative, smartphone-based, just-in-time adaptive intervention that assessed predictors of HIV risk behaviors in real time and automatically provided behavioral feedback and goal attainment information. Methods: A randomized attention control design was used among young adults experiencing homelessness, aged 18-25 years, recruited from shelters and drop-in centers in May 2019. Participants were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. The intervention (called MY-RID [Motivating Youth to Reduce Infection and Disconnection]) consisted of brief messages delivered via smartphone over 6 weeks in response to preidentified predictors that were assessed using ecological momentary assessments. Bayesian hierarchical regression models were used to assess intervention effects on sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, and their corresponding urges. Results: Participants (N=97) were predominantly youth (mean age 21.2, SD 2.1 years) who identified as heterosexual (n=51, 52%), male (n=56, 57%), and African American (n=56, 57%). Reports of sexual activity, drug use, alcohol use, stress, and all urges (ie, sexual, drug, alcohol) reduced over time in both groups. Daily drug use reduced by a factor of 13.8 times over 6 weeks in the intervention group relative to the control group (Multimedia Appendix 4). Lower urges for sex were found in the intervention group relative to the control group over the duration of the study. Finally, there was a statistically significant reduction in reports of feeling stressed the day before between the intervention and control conditions (P=.03). Conclusions: Findings indicate promising intervention effects on drug use, stress, and urges for sex in a hard-to-reach, high-risk population. The MY-RID intervention should be further tested in a larger randomized controlled trial to further investigate its efficacy and impact on sexual risk behaviors.

N2  - Mobile mental health apps can help bridge gaps in access to care for those with substance use disorders and dual diagnoses. The authors describe a portfolio of free, publicly available mobile mental health apps developed by the National Center for PTSD. The authors also demonstrate how this suite of primarily non-substance use disorder-specific mobile mental health apps may support the active ingredients of substance use disorder treatment or be used for self-management of substance use disorder and related issues. The potential advantages of these apps, as well as limitations and considerations for future app development, are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - It is not known how faculty of online teachers in higher education courses described their participation in social networking communities and the influence of their community involvement on their preparation for, and application of technology-mediated teaching skills and training, in social networking communities for online teachers in higher education within the United States. Garrison's community of inquiry framework guided the current study. A qualitative descriptive study was used to collect data through convenience sampling. The study used questionnaires and interviews for data collection. Fifty online teachers completed the study criteria screening questionnaire. The researcher selected 22 online teachers for Skype interviews. Data analysis was conducted where codes were created and then grouped and analyzed to identify patterns and relationships. Five dominant themes were found: 1) collaboration and communication, 2) avoiding negative interactions, 3) personalized feedback, 4) SNC is quick and easily accessible, and 5) technology and the importance of platform training availability to participants. Participants described the importance of collaboration and communication and how their interactions within social networking communities allowed for positive teaching experiences. Teachers were able to find answers quickly and easily to personal teaching needs and platform or technology training. Some participants experienced negativity within the communities where the SNC experience was not as beneficial. The results that the current study revealed are important to education policy makers, teachers, and students. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Sleep disorders are prevalent, and our understanding of these disorders has grown significantly during the last few decades. Sleep laboratories grew out of intense research in academic centers and expanded to almost any major health-care establishment. Sleep centers provide comprehensive assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of various sleep disorders. Advancement of technology, the presence of the World Wide Web, and wireless services added to the universal presence of smartphone technology provided unprecedented connectivity and accessibility. Logically, sleep services that are most in need of a detailed interview and completion of some objective assessments are amenable to remote access. Telemedicine provides services in both synchronous and asynchronous fashion. The synchronous telemedicine includes practitioner's detail evaluation of patients in real-time, diagnostic assessments, initiation of various therapies, follow-up of therapy and assessment of utilization, evaluation of patients' knowledge, patient education, and implementation of cognitive-behavioral therapy of insomnia. Asynchronous services encompass review and interpretation sleep study and other objective test results. Telemedicine promises to improve access to health care as it provides care anytime and anyplace. However, providing medical care using telemedicine has its complexities. In this chapter, we will review the application of telemedicine in the field of sleep services and discuss issues related to the implementation of telesleep (TS) in a government health-care setting.

N2  - Background and objectives: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a first-line treatment for anxiety, but it is not widely available as clinical guidelines recommend. We examined the feasibility and efficacy of a novel smartphone-based fully automated digital CBT intervention, 'DaylightTM', to improve symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Methods: In this multiple-baseline design, 21 adults (20 F; mean age 43yrs. range 19-65yrs.) with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD were randomized to one of three baseline durations (2-, 4-, or 6-weeks) and then received access to digital CBT. Participants completed daily ratings of anxiety and worry, weekly measures of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep, and measures of anxiety, worry, wellbeing, quality of life, CBT skill acquisition, and work performance at initial assessment prior to baseline randomization, post-intervention, and follow-up. Results: Digital CBT was found to be feasible in terms of engagement, satisfaction, and safety. For preliminary efficacy, improvements were detected in daily and weekly outcomes of anxiety for most participants. Despite individual differences, significant improvements occurred with the introduction of digital CBT and not during baseline. Overall, 70% of participants no longer had clinically significant symptoms of GAD, 61% no longer had significant depressive symptoms, and 40% no longer had significant sleep difficulty at post-intervention. Limitations: The study sample was recruited using the internet and was mostly female, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Conclusions: Findings support the feasibility and efficacy of Daylight. Further examination in randomized controlled trials is now warranted.

N2  - In this chapter we discuss recent trends in tobacco and nicotine use, both in the general population and in high-risk groups. This is followed by a brief review of current clinical practice guidelines for tobacco cessation interventions as well as currently available evidence-based treatments. Next, we review the evidence for and outline key features and categories of mobile technology interventions for tobacco cessation, including text messaging, apps, and interventions offered on social media and social messaging platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. During this review, we highlight apps designed to be used as self-management vs. those used as adjunctive treatments to complement existing evidence-based treatments. Examples of both freely available, public domain products and fee-for-service mobile interventions are discussed. We also highlight specific mobile technology interventions designed for high-priority populations and novel smartphone compatible sensor technologies. Most, but not all, of the mobile interven tions reviewed are based on resources available and studies conducted in the United States (U.S.). We conclude by discussing where future work is needed for continued progress in improving tobacco cessation efforts using mobile interventions.

N2  - Technology is transforming the way that health care is delivered. Going forward, digital health tools will provide consumers with "always-on access to care" (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, 2019, p. 5). Clinical practice in an age of connectivity involves several important developments: an educated consumer who is more fully integrated into the treatment plan; the popularity of social networks and crowd-sourcing as a means to consume and evaluate health information; the advent of wearable sensors that allow users to track exercise and nutrition regimens and obtain physiological feedback; advancements in user interfaces (a "conversational exchange" with the software); files that can upload from a device directly into an electronic health record; "virtual" clinics; and synchronous and asynchronous communication methods (email, texting, instant messaging) that will significantly alter traditional notions about appointment scheduling and the office setting. The future therapist will have "a traditional office and an e-office, an online space for internet therapy," wherein treatment "will be offered both online and offline" (Ybarra & Eaton, 2005, p. 85). There is good reason for clinicians to turn to the internet to support treatment planning: consumers use websites to obtain information about health conditions, and studies show positive outcomes for internet-based interventions across a range of behavioral concerns. In fact, at the time of the writing of this chapter (mid-2019), there were over 200 controlled studies (and possibly 300, including unpublished studies) evaluating the internet as a platform for health-type information (Andersson, 2018).

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - College students face an important developmental transition that can be accompanied by increased risk for mental health issues and vulnerability to stress and adversity. Increased levels of psychological well-being (PWB) have been found to buffer this risk. Pertinent for this educational phase, research shows that skills for improving PWB may be learned through PWB intervention - such trainings may be effective in improving students' mental health performance, similar to intellectual training for academic performance. This dissertation examined the present state of PWB intervention science, along with an arising hypothesis of PWB as a process, and developed a new conceptual and statistical model for more deeply assessing PWB change in intervention. Study 1 explored recent developments in PWB science and its rapid evolution alongside mobile health care (mHealth) assessment/delivery platforms, which reveal granular behavioral processes. The hypothesis of PWB as a process was posited and defined as a continual process of healthy functioning that unfolds over a lifetime, and cannot be fully assessed with prevailing statistical methods. The Bayesian statistical framework was offered as a flexible and unified solution to addressing new, previously unanswerable research questions related to PWB inference and dynamic measurement. Study 2 thus utilized Bayesian methods to develop a new approach - the growth of hierarchical autoregression (GoHiAR) model, articulated by theoretically meaningful time series parameters nested within a growth curve model - for assessing PWB processes and how they are differentially impacted by PWB interventions. Specifically, this model was applied to an 8-week mHealth intervention study (n=160) to investigate and improve college student mental health. This empirical assessment aimed to explore: (1) how dynamic PWB characteristics of college students change over 8 weeks of mobile assessment, (2) how two separate mHealth PWB interventions differentially change these characteristics, and (3) how moderating factors relate to whether one student does better/worse with a particular intervention. Findings suggest that (1) the mobile assessment tool itself may have longitudinally improved college student PWB, as evidenced by instances of directional changes in dynamic characteristics (increased baseline levels, decreased fluctuation, and increased regulation) of PWB outcomes; and (2) although the mHealth interventions did not have added benefit over mobile assessment at the group level; (3) these interventions were differentially beneficial for students based on their level of negative affect (NA). Specifically, for college students with low NA, both mHealth interventions - positive practices (PPI) and positive practices with brief meditation exercises (PPI+Med) - as well as digital monitoring alone (control group), were beneficial in improving PWB. Conversely, for college students with high NA, digital monitoring and positive practices remained beneficial; but the added component of brief meditative exercises (PPI+Med) appeared to have negatively affected PWB. Although we might have hypothesized that students with high NA would do worse overall in both interventions - this does not explain why one intervention appears to work, and the other does not, for this sub-group. These results provide evidence to suggest that certain kinds of PWB interventions are differentially suitable for different groups of college students. Overall, the findings highlight an important need to further investigate (1) the utility of tailoring meditation interventions for participants with highly negative emotional experiences, and (2) the efficacy of digital monitoring in and of itself as an intervention.

N2  - Insomnia is highly prevalent among military veterans but access to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is limited. Thus, this study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of Insomnia Coach, a CBT-I-based, free, self-management mobile app. Fifty U.S. veterans, who were mostly male (58%) and mean age 44.5 (range = 28-55) years with moderate insomnia symptoms were randomized to Insomnia Coach (n = 25) or a wait-list control condition (n = 25) for 6 weeks. Participants completed self-report measures and sleep diaries at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up (12 weeks postrandomization), and app participants (n = 15) completed a qualitative interview at posttreatment. Findings suggest that Insomnia Coach is feasible to use, with three quarters of participants using the app through 6 weeks and engaging with active elements. For acceptability, perceptions of Insomnia Coach were very favorable based on both self-report and qualitative interview responses. Finally, for potential efficacy, at posttreatment, a larger proportion of Insomnia Coach (28%) than wait-list control participants (4%) achieved clinically significant improvement (p = .049) and there was a significant treatment effect on daytime sleep-related impairment (d = -0.6, p = .044). Additional treatment effects emerged at follow-up for insomnia severity (d = -1.1, p = .001), sleep onset latency (d = -0.6, p = .021), global sleep quality (d = -0.9, p = .002), and depression symptoms (d = -0.8, p = .012). These findings provide preliminary evidence that among veterans with moderate insomnia symptoms, a CBT-I-based self-management app is feasible, acceptable, and promising for improving insomnia severity and other sleep-related outcomes. Given the vast unmet need for insomnia treatment in the population, Insomnia Coach may provide an easily accessible, convenient public health intervention for individuals not receiving care.

N2  - This study assessed the efficacy of a virtual reality biofeedback video game (DEEP) in reducing anxiety symptoms. In addition, changes in engagement and cognitive appraisals including self-efficacy, locus of control, and threat-challenge appraisals were measured and it was explored how these factors related to anxiety regulation. Undergraduates with elevated anxiety symptoms (N = 112) were randomly assigned to four training sessions with DEEP or a smartphone-guided breathing application. Trait anxiety was measured at screening, pretest, posttest, and 3 months later. State anxiety was assessed before and after each session. In addition, engagement and appraisals were assessed in each session. Participants in both conditions showed a significant decrease in trait anxiety symptoms from pre- to posttest and this decrease remained stable at follow-up. Furthermore, all participants decreased in state anxiety from pre- to postsession, except for DEEP sessions that included exposure. DEEP users increased in self-efficacy and observed resources to cope throughout the training. In addition, DEEP users felt more engaged in initial sessions than those who used the control application, but their engagement decreased toward the final session. In contrast, participants in the control group showed no change in appraisals nor engagement. Taken together, results demonstrate the potential of digital interventions such as biofeedback games and guided relaxation applications as anxiety regulation tools and show that self-efficacy and threat-challenge appraisals in particular are potential mechanisms of change in biofeedback interventions.

N2  - Low-income couples tend to face more external stressors and report less stable romantic relationships compared to higher income couples. A recent nationwide randomized controlled trial of the web-based OurRelationship and ePREP programs was conducted with a sample of 742 lower income couples within 200% of the federal poverty line to help improve relationship distress (Doss et al., 2020). Using a socioecological framework, the current study examined whether the presence of intrapersonal-level, couple-level, and community-level factors moderated those couples' gains in relationship satisfaction during the intervention period as well as maintenance of those gains over 4-month follow-up relative to waitlist-control. Using multilevel modeling, results revealed that both interventions were effective in serving lower income couples relative to couples in the waitlist control group with minimal evidence of moderation by individual-level, couple-level, or neighborhood factors. Thus, the interventions are effective in reducing relationship distress across many socioecological factors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Objectives Young adults have the highest rates of substance use of any age group. Although men historically have higher rates of substance use disorders (SUDs) than women, research shows this gender gap is narrowing. Young adults with comorbid psychiatric disorders are at increased risk for developing a SUD. Co-occurring psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating and post-traumatic stress disorders are more prevalent in women than men with SUDs, yet mental health treatment often does not adequately address substance use in patients receiving care for a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Tailored gender-responsive interventions for women with psychiatric disorders and co-occurring SUD have gained empirical support. Digital interventions tailored to young adult women with co-occurring disorders have the potential to overcome barriers to addressing substance use for young adult women in a psychiatric treatment setting. This study utilized a user-centered design process to better understand how technology could be used to address substance use in young adult women receiving inpatient and residential psychiatric care. Methods: Women (N = 15; age 18-25 years), recruited from five psychiatric treatment programs, engaged in a qualitative interview and completed self-report surveys on technology use and acceptability. Qualitative interviews were coded for salient themes. Results: Results showed that few participants were currently using mental health web-based applications (i.e., "apps"), but most participants expressed an interest in using apps as part of their mental health treatment. Participants identified several important topics salient to women their age including substance use and sexual assault, stigma and shame, difficulties abstaining from substance use while maintaining social relationships with peers, and negative emotions as a trigger for use. Conclusions: These data provide preliminary evidence that a digital intervention may be a feasible way to address co-occurring substance use problems in young adult women receiving care in a psychiatric setting.

N2  - Background: Although web-based psychoeducational programs may be an efficient, accessible, and scalable option for improving participant well-being, they seldom are sustained beyond trial publication. Implementation evaluations may help optimize program uptake, but few are performed. When the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) launched the web-based psychoeducational workshop Building Better Caregivers (BBC) for informal caregivers of veterans nationwide in 2013, the workshop did not enroll as many caregivers as anticipated. Objective: This study aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of initial implementation, strategies likely to improve workshop uptake, whether the VA adopted these strategies, and whether workshop enrollment changed. Methods: We used mixed methods and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) implementation evaluation framework. In stage 1, we conducted semistructured interviews with caregivers, local staff, and regional and national VA leaders and surveys with caregivers and staff. We collected and analyzed survey and interview data concurrently and integrated the results to identify implementation strengths and weaknesses, and strategies likely to improve workshop uptake. In stage 2, we reinterviewed national leaders to determine whether the VA adopted recommended strategies and used national data to determine whether workshop enrollment changed over time. Results: A total of 54 caregivers (n=32, 59%), staff (n=13, 24%), and regional (n=5, 9%) and national (n=4, 7%) leaders were interviewed. We received survey responses from 72% (23/32) of caregivers and 77% (10/13) of local staff. In stage 1, survey and interview results were consistent across multiple PARIHS constructs. Although participants from low-enrollment centers reported fewer implementation strengths and more weaknesses, qualitative themes were consistent across high- and low-enrollment centers, and across caregiver, staff, and leadership respondent groups. Identified strengths included belief in a positive workshop impact and the use of some successful outreach approaches. Implementation weaknesses included missed opportunities to improve outreach and to better support local staff. From these, we identified and recommended new and enhanced implementation strategies-increased investment in outreach and marketing capabilities; tailoring outreach strategies to multiple stakeholder groups; use of campaigns that are personal, repeated, and detailed, and have diverse delivery options; recurrent training and mentoring for new staff; and comprehensive data management and reporting capabilities. In stage 2, we determined that the VA had adopted several of these strategies in 2016. In the 3 years before and after adoption, cumulative BBC enrollment increased from 2139 (2013-2015) to 4030 (2016-2018) caregivers. Conclusions: This study expands the limited implementation science literature on best practices to use when implementing web-based psychoeducational programs. We found that robust outreach and marketing strategies and support for local staff were critical to the implementation success of the BBC workshop. Other health systems may want to deploy these strategies when implementing their web-based programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Due to the limited access to treatment facilities, during recent years, and especially emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an rapid increase in the international interest on the potential in advancing the use of various mobile health (mHealth) technologies for both monitoring and treatment within mental health care. Unlike face-to-face treatment, mHealth interventions, and especially smartphones, has the unique potential to reach many people without geographic boundaries delivering onthe-go treatment. Using smartphones to develop a digital fine-grained and real-time record of patients' digital life and symptoms could provide opportunities for early intervention. Due to the rapid development of mHealth solutions, it has been suggested that it may be time for methodological changes, such as the abandonment of RCTs as the primary method of scientific evaluation and an increased use of iterative participatory research and single-case design. In conclusion, we find that smartphone-based data collection holds great promise as a monitoring tool for digital phenotyping allowing for monitoring of course of illness, identification of early treatment effect, prognosis, diagnoses and prediction of upcoming deteriorations.

N2  - Background: Smartphones and mobile applications have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, a pattern that has also been reflected in the health care system. Despite increased reliance among clinicians however, limited research has been conducted on the uptake and impact of smartphone usage in medical practice, especially outside the Western world. Objective: This study aimed to identify the usage of smartphones and medical apps by doctors in the clinical setting in 2 culturally distinct countries: King Hamad University Hospital (KHUH), Bahrain and Queen Mary Hospital (QMH), Hong Kong. Methods: A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted where doctors in both hospitals were asked to take part in a 15-item online survey. The questions were categorized into the following groups: demographics of the study population, ownership and main use of smartphones, number and names of medical apps currently owned, rating usage of smartphones for medical purposes, time spent on a smartphone related to clinical use, clinical reliance on smartphones, and views on further integration of smartphones. The results were then tabulated and analyzed using SPSS Statistics 25 for Mac (IBM Corp Inc, Armonk, NY). Results: A total of 200 doctors were surveyed, with a total of 99.0% (99/100) of the doctors owning a smartphone in both KHUH and QMH; 58% (57/99) and 55% (54/99) of the doctors from KHUH and QMH, respectively, identified communication as their main use of smartphones in the clinical setting (P = .004). Doctors from KHUH were likely to spend more time on medical apps than doctors from QMH (P = .002). According to the overall results of both hospitals, 48% (32/67) of the junior doctors claimed high reliance on smartphones, whereas only 32.3% (41/127) of the senior doctors said the same (P = .03). Of doctors in KHUH and QMH, 78.0% (78/100) and 69.0% (69/100), respectively, either strongly agreed or agreed that smartphones need to be integrated into the clinical setting. In terms of preferences for future apps, 48% (48/100) and 56% (56/100) of the doctors in KHUH and QMH, respectively, agreed that more medical applications need to be created in order to support smartphone use in the clinical setting. Conclusions: These results suggest a substantial acceptance of smartphones by doctors in the clinical setting. It also elicits the need to establish policies to officially integrate smartphone technology into health care in accordance with ethical guidelines. More emphasis should be placed on creating medical applications that aid health care professionals in attaining their information from accurate sources and also regulate a system to monitor the usage of mobile devices within hospitals to prevent a breach of patient privacy and confidentiality.

N2  - Background: For the safety monitoring of vaccinations postlicensure, reports of adverse events after immunization (AEFIs) are crucial. New technologies such as digital mobile apps can be used as an active approach to capture these events. We therefore conducted a feasibility study among recipients of the influenza vaccination using an app for assessment of the reporting of AEFIs. Objective: The goal of the research was to determine factors influencing adherence to and correct use of a newly developed app for individuals to report AEFI for 3 months using regular reminder functions, to identify determinants of AEFI occurrence and define reported AEFI types. Methods: We developed the app (SafeVac) and offered it to recipients of the influenza vaccination in 3 occupational settings in fall 2018. In this prospective longitudinal feasibility study, data on AEFIs were generated through SafeVac for 3 months. Using logistic and Cox regression, we assessed associations between app adherence, correct app entry, AEFIs, and sociodemographic parameters. Results: Of the individuals who logged into SafeVac, 61.4% (207/337) used the app throughout a 3-month period. App use adherence was negatively associated with female sex (odds ratio [OR] 0.47; CI 0.25-0.91) and correct app entry was negatively associated with older age (OR 0.96; CI 0.93-0.99) and lower education (OR 0.31; CI 0.13-0.76). AEFI occurrence was associated with female sex (hazard ratio 1.41; CI 1.01-1.96) and negatively with older age (hazard ratio 0.98; CI 0.97-0.99). The most common AEFIs reported were injection site pain (106/337), pain in extremity (103/337), and fatigue/asthenia (73/337). Conclusions: Digital AEFI reporting was feasible with SafeVac and generated plausible results for this observation period and setting. Studies directly comparing SafeVac with conventional passive reporting schemes could determine whether such digital approaches improve completeness, timeliness, and sensitivity of vaccine vigilance. Further studies should evaluate if these results are transferable to other vaccinations and populations and if introduction of such a tool has an influence on vaccination readiness and therefore vaccine safety.

N2  - Background: eHealth interventions based on risk stratification have not been extensively applied for HIV behavioral interventions among HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM). Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile phone intervention based on an HIV risk prediction tool in promoting HIV testing and reducing high-risk behavior among HIV-negative MSM in China. Methods: We performed a mobile phone-based randomized controlled clinical trial for 12 weeks. A comprehensive intervention package deployed on Jinshuju-an online survey platform-was developed and consisted of 4 components: (1) a validated HIV risk prediction tool that provides information on personalized risk reduction interventions; (2) a map of individualized HIV testing facilities based on their geographic location; (3) a QR code for free resources on HIV prevention, including condoms and HIV self-testing kits; and (4) general resources for HIV health education. MSM participants recruited from WeChat/QQ groups were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group at a 1:1 ratio. The staff sent the QR code for the comprehensive intervention package to MSM in the intervention group over WeChat and sent the QR code only for the resources on HIV health education to those in the control group. At baseline and 12-week follow-up, data on HIV-related risk behavior and HIV testing behavior were collected through the Jinshuju online survey platform. Results: In total, 192 MSM were recruited and assigned to the intervention or control group (n=96 each). At week 12, the total clinical trial retention rate was 87.5%. The number of male sexual partners of the MSM in the past 3 months was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (3.51, SD 4.1 vs 6.01, SD 11.4, respectively; mean difference -2.5; 95% CI -5.12 to 0.12; P=.05); the rate of condom use with casual sexual partners was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (87%, n=66/76 vs 70%, n=54/77 respectively; odds ratio 2.81, 95% CI 1.23-6.39; P=.01). The proportion of individuals intending to undergo HIV testing after in the following 30 days was marginally higher in the intervention group than in the control group (90%, n=77/86 vs 79%, n=65/82 respectively; odds ratio 2.20, 95% CI 0.90-5.35; P=.07). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of eHealth intervention was US $131.60 on reducing 1 sexual partner and US $19.70 for a 1% increment in condom usage with casual partners. Conclusions: A comprehensive intervention based on an HIV risk prediction tool can reduce the number of male sexual partners among MSM and increase the rate of condom use with casual partners. Hence, this intervention is a very promising preventive strategy for HIV among MSM, especially in areas with a prominent HIV epidemic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: New technologies are changing access to medical records and the relationship between physicians and patients. Professionals can now use e-mental health tools to provide prompt and personalized responses to patients with mental illness. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the digital phenotypes of patients who use e-mental health apps. Objective: This study aimed to reveal the profiles of users of a mental health app through machine learning techniques. Methods: We applied a nonparametric model, the Sparse Poisson Factorization Model, to discover latent features in the response patterns of 2254 psychiatric outpatients to a short self-assessment on general health. The assessment was completed through a mental health app after the first login. Results: The results showed the following four different profiles of patients: (1) all patients had feelings of worthlessness, aggressiveness, and suicidal ideas; (2) one in four reported low energy and difficulties to cope with problems; (3) less than a quarter described depressive symptoms with extremely high scores in suicidal thoughts and aggressiveness; and (4) a small number, possibly with the most severe conditions, reported a combination of all these features. Conclusions: User profiles did not overlap with clinician-made diagnoses. Since each profile seems to be associated with a different level of severity, the profiles could be useful for the prediction of behavioral risks among users of e-mental health apps.

N2  - Background: Mobile health technology has demonstrated the ability of smartphone apps and sensors to collect data pertaining to patient activity, behavior, and cognition. It also offers the opportunity to understand how everyday passive mobile metrics such as battery life and screen time relate to mental health outcomes through continuous sensing. Impulsivity is an underlying factor in numerous physical and mental health problems. However, few studies have been designed to help us understand how mobile sensors and self-report data can improve our understanding of impulsive behavior. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of using mobile sensor data to detect and monitor self-reported state impulsivity and impulsive behavior passively via a cross-platform mobile sensing application. Methods: We enrolled 26 participants who were part of a larger study of impulsivity to take part in a real-world, continuous mobile sensing study over 21 days on both Apple operating system (iOS) and Android platforms. The mobile sensing system (mPulse) collected data from call logs, battery charging, and screen checking. To validate the model, we used mobile sensing features to predict common self-reported impulsivity traits, objective mobile behavioral and cognitive measures, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of state impulsivity and constructs related to impulsive behavior (ie, risk-taking, attention, and affect). Results: Overall, the findings suggested that passive measures of mobile phone use such as call logs, battery charging, and screen checking can predict different facets of trait and state impulsivity and impulsive behavior. For impulsivity traits, the models significantly explained variance in sensation seeking, planning, and lack of perseverance traits but failed to explain motor, urgency, lack of premeditation, and attention traits. Passive sensing features from call logs, battery charging, and screen checking were particularly useful in explaining and predicting trait-based sensation seeking. On a daily level, the model successfully predicted objective behavioral measures such as present bias in delay discounting tasks, commission and omission errors in a cognitive attention task, and total gains in a risk-taking task. Our models also predicted daily EMA questions on positivity, stress, productivity, healthiness, and emotion and affect. Perhaps most intriguingly, the model failed to predict daily EMA designed to measure previous-day impulsivity using face-valid questions. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the potential for developing trait and state impulsivity phenotypes and detecting impulsive behavior from everyday mobile phone sensors. Limitations of the current research and suggestions for building more precise passive sensing models are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Downloading a COVID-19 contact tracing app may be effective in reducing users' worry about COVID-19 and psychological distress. Objective: This 2.5-month prospective study aimed to investigate the association of downloading a COVID-19 contact tracing app, the COVID-19 Contact Confirming Application (COCOA), released by the Japanese government, with worry about COVID-19 and psychological distress in a sample of employed adults in Japan. Methods: A total of 996 full-time employed respondents to an online survey conducted May 22-26, 2020 (baseline), were invited to participate in a follow-up survey August 7-12, 2020 (follow-up). A high level of worrying about COVID-19 and high psychological distress were defined by baseline and follow-up scores on a single-item scale and the Kessler 6 (K6) scale, respectively. The app was released between the two surveys, on June 17. Participants were asked at follow-up if they downloaded the app. Results: A total of 902 (90.6%) of 996 baseline participants responded to the follow-up survey. Among them, 184 (20.4%) reported that they downloaded the app. Downloading of the contact tracing app was significantly negatively associated with psychological distress at follow-up after controlling for baseline variables, but not with worry about COVID-19. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that using a government-issued COVID-19 contact tracing app may be beneficial for the mental health of employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - Background: Engagement is positively associated with the effectiveness of digital health interventions. It is unclear whether tracking devices that automatically synchronize data (eg, Fitbit) produce different engagement levels compared with manually entering data. Objective: This study examines how different step logging methods in the freely available 10,000 Steps physical activity program differ according to age and gender and are associated with program engagement. Methods: A subsample of users (n=22,142) of the free 10,000 Steps physical activity program were classified into one of the following user groups based on the step-logging method: Website Only (14,617/22,142, 66.01%), App Only (2100/22,142, 9.48%), Fitbit Only (1705/22,142, 7.7%), Web and App (2057/22,142, 9.29%), and Fitbit Combination (combination of web, app, and Fitbit; 1663/22,142, 7.51%). Generalized linear regression and binary logistic regression were used to examine differences between user groups' engagement and participation parameters. The time to nonusage attrition was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: App Only users were significantly younger and Fitbit user groups had higher proportions of women compared with other groups. The following outcomes were significant and relative to the Website Only group. The App Only group had fewer website sessions (odds ratio [OR] -6.9, 95% CI -7.6 to -6.2), whereas the Fitbit Only (OR 10.6, 95% CI 8.8-12.3), Web and App (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.4-2.6), and Fitbit Combination (OR 8.0; 95% CI 6.2-9.7) groups had more sessions. The App Only (OR -0.7, 95% CI -0.9 to -0.4) and Fitbit Only (OR -0.5, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.2) groups spent fewer minutes on the website per session, whereas the Fitbit Combination group (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0-0.5) spent more minutes. All groups, except the Fitbit Combination group, viewed fewer website pages per session. The mean daily step count was lower for the App Only (OR -201.9, 95% CI -387.7 to -116.0) and Fitbit Only (OR -492.9, 95% CI -679.9 to -305.8) groups but higher for the Web and App group (OR 258.0, 95% CI 76.9-439.2). The Fitbit Only (OR 5.0, 95% CI 3.4-6.6), Web and App (OR 7.2, 95% CI 5.9-8.6), and Fitbit Combination (OR 15.6, 95% CI 13.7-17.5) groups logged a greater number of step entries. The App Only group was less likely (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.94) and other groups were more likely to participate in Challenges. The mean time to nonusage attrition was 35 (SD 26) days and was lower than average in the Website Only and App Only groups and higher than average in the Web and App and Fitbit Combination groups. Conclusions: Using a Fitbit in combination with the 10,000 Steps app or website enhanced engagement with a real-world physical activity program. Integrating tracking devices that synchronize data automatically into real-world physical activity interventions is one strategy for improving engagement.

N2  - Background: Video is a versatile and popular medium for digital health interventions. As mobile device and app technology advances, it is likely that video-based interventions will become increasingly common. Although clinic waiting rooms are complex and busy environments, they offer the opportunity to facilitate engagement with video-based digital interventions as patients wait to see their providers. However, to increase efficiency in public health, leverage the scalability and low cost of implementing digital interventions, and keep up with rapidly advancing technology and user needs, more design and development guidance is needed for video-based tailored interventions. Objective: We provide a tutorial for digital intervention researchers and developers to efficiently design and develop video-based tailored digital health interventions. We describe the challenges and solutions encountered with Positive Health Check (PHC), a hybrid app used to deliver a brief, interactive, individually tailored video-based HIV behavioral counseling intervention. PHC uses video clips and multimedia digital assets to deliver intervention content, including interactive tailored messages and graphics, a repurposed animated video, and patient and provider handouts generated in real time by PHC. Methods: We chronicle multiple challenges and solutions for the following: (1) using video as a medium to enhance user engagement, (2) navigating the complexity of linking a database of video clips with other digital assets, and (3) identifying the main steps involved in building an app that will seamlessly deliver to users individually tailored messages, graphics, and handouts. Results: We leveraged video to enhance user engagement by featuring "video doctors," full-screen video, storyboards, and streamlined scripts. We developed an approach to link the database of video clips with other digital assets through script coding and flow diagrams of algorithms to deliver a tailored user experience. We identified the steps to app development by using keyframes to design the integration of video and digital assets, using agile development methods to gather iterative feedback from multidisciplinary teams, and creating an intelligent data-driven back-end solution to tailor message delivery to individual users. Conclusions: Video-based digital health interventions will continue to play an important role in the future of HIV prevention and treatment, as well as other clinical health practices. However, facilitating the adoption of an HIV video intervention in HIV clinical settings is a work in progress. Our experience in designing and developing PHC presented unique challenges due to the extensive use of a large database of videos tailored individually to each user. Although PHC focuses on promoting the health and well-being of persons with HIV, the challenges and solutions presented in this tutorial are transferable to the design and development of video-based digital health interventions focused on other areas of health.

N2  - Background: Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a behavioral health intervention with strong empirical support for chronic pain but, to date, widespread dissemination is limited. Digital solutions improve access to care and can be integrated into patients' everyday lives. Objective: ACTsmart, a guided smartphone-delivered ACT intervention, was developed to improve the accessibility of an evidence-based behavioral treatment for chronic pain. In the present study, we evaluated the preliminary efficacy of ACTsmart in adults with chronic pain. Methods: The study was an open-label pilot trial. The treatment lasted for 8 weeks, and participants completed all outcome measures at pretreatment and posttreatment and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups, with weekly assessments of selected measures during treatment. The primary outcome was pain interference. The secondary outcomes were psychological flexibility, values, insomnia, anxiety, depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and pain intensity. All outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Results: The sample consisted of 34 adults (88% women) with long-standing chronic pain (M=20.4 years, SD=11.7). Compliance to treatment was high, and at the end of treatment, we observed a significant improvement in the primary outcome of pain interference (d = -1.01). All secondary outcomes significantly improved from pretreatment to posttreatment with small to large effect sizes. Improvements were maintained throughout 12 months of follow-up. Conclusion: The results of this pilot study provide preliminary support for ACTsmart as an accessible and effective behavioral health treatment for adults with chronic pain and warrant a randomized controlled trial to further evaluate the efficacy of the intervention.

N2  - Technology-based physical activity programs are a novel solution to the major public health issue of physical inactivity. However, to be successful, there must be a large and population-appropriate uptake, which depends heavily on promotion. This study evaluates the effectiveness of an advertising campaign to disseminate a physical activity smartphone app. The experiment used a 3 x 3 x 3 full-factorial design, examining platforms (Facebook; Facebook Messenger; Instagram), selling-techniques (hard-sell-sending viewers directly to (a) Apple Store or (b) Google Play, and soft-sell-sending viewers from an ad to a (c) landing-page, then to an app store) and themes (Health and Wellbeing; Body and Self-Confidence; Social Enjoyment). Outcomes were reach, click-through, and app downloads. Advertisements reached 1,373,273 people, achieving 2,989 clicks and 667 downloads. Instagram and Facebook Messenger had higher reach compared to Facebook (F[2,27] = 27.17, p < .001), whilst Facebook and Facebook Messenger both produced higher click-through (F[2,27] = 8.98, p < .001) and downloads (F[2,27] = 4.649, p = .018). Selling-technique differed, with soft-selling ads producing greater reach (F[2,27] = 4,616.077, p < .001); however, both hard-selling ads (Apple Store and Google Play) had greater click-through (F[2,27] = 10.77, p < .001) and downloads (F[2,27] = 3.791, p < .001). Advertising theme varied, with Social Enjoyment themes producing less click-through (F[2,27] = 5.709, p = .009) and downloads (F[2,27] = 5.480, p = .010). We recommend future studies to consider Facebook and Facebook Messenger, using hard-selling techniques, with themes relating to Health and Wellbeing and Body and Self-Confidence. Advertisements targeting women, promoting a health-related physical activity smartphone app, performed better on Facebook and Messenger, using hard-selling techniques, with themes relating to Health & Wellbeing and Body & Self-Confidence."

N2  - Background: There is widespread agreement on the promise of patient-facing digital health tools to transform health care. Yet, few tools are in widespread use or have documented clinical effectiveness. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the gap between the potential of patient-facing digital health tools and real-world uptake. Methods: We interviewed and surveyed experts (in total, n = 24) across key digital health stakeholder groups-venture capitalists, digital health companies, payers, and health care system providers or leaders-guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Results: Our findings revealed that external policy, regulatory demands, internal organizational workflow, and integration needs often take priority over patient needs and patient preferences for digital health tools, which lowers patient acceptance rates. We discovered alignment, across all 4 stakeholder groups, in the desire to engage both patients and frontline health care providers in broader dissemination and evaluation of digital health tools. However, major areas of misalignment between stakeholder groups have stymied the progress of digital health tool uptake-venture capitalists and companies focused on external policy and regulatory demands, while payers and providers focused on internal organizational workflow and integration needs. Conclusions: Misalignment of the priorities of digital health companies and their funders with those of providers and payers requires direct attention to improve uptake of patient-facing digital health tools and platforms.

N2  - Background: The English Global Digital Exemplar (GDE) program is one of the first concerted efforts to create a digital health learning ecosystem across a national health service. Objective: This study aims to explore mechanisms that support or inhibit the exchange of interorganizational digital transformation knowledge. Methods: We conducted a formative qualitative evaluation of the GDE program. We used semistructured interviews with clinical, technical, and managerial staff; national program managers and network leaders; nonparticipant observations of knowledge transfer activities through attending meetings, workshops, and conferences; and documentary analysis of policy documents. The data were thematically analyzed by drawing on a theory-informed sociotechnical coding framework. We used a mixture of deductive and inductive methods, supported by NVivo software, to facilitate coding. Results: We conducted 341 one-on-one and 116 group interviews, observed 86 meetings, and analyzed 245 documents from 36 participating provider organizations. We also conducted 51 high-level interviews with policy makers and vendors; performed 77 observations of national meetings, workshops, and conferences; and analyzed 80 national documents. Formal processes put in place by the GDE program to initiate and reinforce knowledge transfer and learning have accelerated the growth of informal knowledge networking and helped establish the foundations of a learning ecosystem. However, formal networks were most effective when supported by informal networking. The benefits of networking were enhanced (and costs reduced) by geographical proximity, shared culture and context, common technological functionality, regional and strategic alignments, and professional agendas. Conclusions: Knowledge exchange is most effective when sustained through informal networking driven by the mutual benefits of sharing knowledge and convergence between group members in their organizational and technological setting and goals. Policy interventions need to enhance incentives and reduce barriers to sharing across the ecosystem, be flexible in tailoring formal interventions to emerging needs, and promote informal knowledge sharing.

N2  - Background: Cancer patients often suffer from high levels of distress. Mobile health (mHealth) applications might be an innovative way to deliver mindfulness and relaxation interventions for cancer patients. However, data about the implementation of apps in health care are lacking. Adherence to mHealth interventions is an important indicator for a successful implementation and might be needed to maximize treatment effects. However, the decrease in distress might reduce the motivation of patients to engage in such self-care tools in the long run. Therefore, the aim of this analysis was to investigate the association between the course of distress over time and the adherence to a relaxation self-care app in cancer patients. Methods: We developed an app for cancer patients (CanRelax) and 83 patients who participated in the prospective observational study used the app at least once. The evaluation was guided by the RE-AIM framework, and this analysis focused on the implementation of the app. Patients were grouped into five subgroups according to their course of distress over 10 weeks (Distress Thermometer). These subgroups of patients were compared with each other to identify different user groups. Findings: About half of the patients were adherent over 10 weeks. However, a decrease in distress was associated with lower adherence to the app intervention, whereas patients with moderate distress or an increase in distress showed more adherence. Conclusion: Adherence to an app intervention might be also driven by patients' distress level. A decrease in distress might reduce patients' motivation to continue with a self-care intervention. The interplay between adherence and treatment outcomes should be explored in upcoming mHealth trials to get a better understanding for the implementation of such interventions. Encouraging patients to continue self-care interventions is a major challenge in integrative medicine if they are delivered digitally. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: The use of mobile health technology has the potential to increase healthcare accessibility, promote self-management, provide education materials, and support self-monitoring of biometrics. This may be of particular benefit to those living in the community with chronic neurological conditions. The purpose of this research was to characterize perspectives of individuals with brain injury or stroke, their care partners, and neuro-rehabilitation clinicians to inform the design of mobile health app-based interventions that address the need for ongoing community-based health-related professional support. Methods: Individuals with stroke or traumatic brain injury, their care partners, and clinicians were recruited from a large university hospital with a specialized neuro-rehabilitation program. Data were collected via semi-structured focus groups and were examined using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Results: Five consistent themes emerged: (a) all-in-one app with customized features; (b) communication with healthcare providers; (c) cognitive strategies; (d) app accessibility; and (e) user education. The clinician focus group reiterated these consumer focus group themes, with one additional theme: (f) logistics of clinician time and effort to provide effective app-based services to patients. Conclusions: Results have directly informed the ongoing development of a community-based mobile health app intervention, and may also inform the content and design of future mHealth technological development in this population.

N2  - Background: Health care systems are currently undergoing a digital transformation that has been primarily triggered by emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G, blockchain, and the digital representation of patients using (mobile) sensor devices. One of the results of this transformation is the gradual virtualization of care. Irrespective of the care environment, trust between caregivers and patients is essential for achieving favorable health outcomes. Given the many breaches of information security and patient safety, today's health information system portfolios do not suffice as infrastructure for establishing and maintaining trust in virtual care environments. Objective: This study aims to establish a theoretical foundation for a complex health care system intervention that aims to exploit a cryptographically secured infrastructure for establishing and maintaining trust in virtualized care environments and, based on this theoretical foundation, present a proof of concept that fulfills the necessary requirements. Methods: This work applies the following framework for the design and evaluation of complex intervention research within health care: a review of the literature and expert consultation for technology forecasting. A proof of concept was developed by following the principles of design science and requirements engineering. Results: This study determined and defined the crucial functional and nonfunctional requirements and principles for enhancing trust between caregivers and patients within a virtualized health care environment. The cornerstone of our architecture is an approach that uses blockchain technology. The proposed decentralized system offers an innovative governance structure for a novel trust model. The presented theoretical design principles are supported by a concrete implementation of an Ethereum-based platform called VerifyMed. Conclusions: A service for enhancing trust in a virtualized health care environment that is built on a public blockchain has a high fit for purpose in Healthcare 4.0.

N2  - Background: Mobile phones may help young people (YP) access health information and support health service engagement. However, in low-income settings there is limited knowledge on YP's phone and internet access to inform the feasibility of implementing digital health interventions. Objective: We investigated access to information and communication technologies among adolescents and young adults in Zimbabwe. Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted from October to December 2018 among YP aged 13-24 years in 5 communities in urban and peri-urban Harare and Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe. Consenting YP completed a self-completed tablet-based questionnaire on mobile phone ownership and use, and use of the internet. The primary outcome was the proportion who reported owning a mobile phone. Secondary outcomes included phone and internet access and use behavior, and ownership and use of other technological devices. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with mobile phone ownership and with internet access, with adjustment for the one-stage cluster sampling design. A priori exploratory variables were age, sex, marital status, and urban/peri-urban residence. Results: A total of 634/719 (88.2%) eligible YP, mean age 18.0 years (SD 3.3) and 62.6% (397/634) females, participated. Of the YP interviewed, 62.6% (396/633; 95% CI 58.5-66.5) reported owning a phone and a further 4.3% (27/633) reported having access to a shared phone. Phone ownership increased with age: 27.0% (43/159) of 13-15-year olds, 61.0% (72/118) of 16-17-year olds, 71.5% (103/144) of 18-19-year olds, and 84.7% (171/202) of 20-24-year olds (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5) per year increase. Ownership was similar among females and males: 61.0% (236/387; 95% CI 55.6-66.1) versus 64.8% (153/236; 95% CI 57.8-71.2), age-adjusted OR 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-1.1); higher in those with secondary level education compared to primary or no education: 67.1% (346/516; 95% CI 62.6-71.2) versus 26% (21/82; 95% CI 16.4-37.7), age-adjusted OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.1-4.8); and similar across other sociodemographic factors. YP reported that 85.3% (361/423) of phones, either owned or shared, were smartphones. Among phone owners, the most commonly used phone app was WhatsApp (71.2%, 282/396), and 16.4% (65/396) reported having ever used their phone to track their health. A total of 407/631 (64.5%; 95% CI 60.3-68.5) currently had access to the internet (used in last 3 months on any device) with access increasing with age (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3 per year increase). In age-adjusted analysis, internet access was higher among males, the unmarried, those with a higher level of education, phone owners, and those who had lived in the community for more than 1 year. The aspect of the internet that YP most disliked was unwanted sexual (29.2%, 136/465) and violent (13.1%, 61/465) content. Conclusions: Mobile phone-based interventions may be feasible in this population; however, such interventions could increase inequity, especially if they require access to the internet. Internet-based interventions should consider potential risks for participants and incorporate skill-building sessions on safe internet and phone use.

N2  - Virtual Reality Self-Modeling (VRSM) is a new self-modeling intervention. It is the coming together of two well-established interventions, video self-modeling (VSM) and virtual reality (VR) and can be described as using 360-degree VR videos, viewed through a VR system headset or smartphone, to depict individuals self-modeling a desired behavior. By using 360-degree video, individuals who watch VRSM interventions will be able to view themselves eliciting a desired behavior while feeling as if they are immersed within the environment being watched. The distinction between traditional VR treatments and traditional VSM treatments is that VRSM delivers both self-modeling and immersive exposure in order to promote treatment gains. Three adult participants with clinically significant chronic stuttering were administered VRSM interventions depicting themselves exhibiting fluent speech in historically problematic speaking situations. The research utilized a randomized multiple baseline design to investigate whether VRSM is an effective intervention for remediating stuttering. After receiving VRSM as an intervention for stuttering, participants demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in their stuttering severity.

Results of this study showed that a virtual reality self-modeling intervention was effective for reducing stuttering from clinical levels to below clinical levels in a sample of adults with chronic stuttering.

N2  - This chapter provides a brief background on the need for digital mental health interventions given the high rates of mental health issues and the barriers to access quality care. Three main types of digital mental health interventions (Internet-based interventions [IBIs], smartphone apps, and virtual and augmented reality [VR and AR, respectively]) were discussed, followed by a consideration of the ethical and logistical issues surrounding digital mental health interventions. The chapter then address issues related to content and design, user engagement, user contact, and formatting of the interventions. Finally, the chapter will end with a discussion of future directions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In recent years, mobile health (mHealth) technologies have received increasing attention from industry and researchers. Such technologies have been the focus of both criticism and high expectations. In this paper, we analyze the integration of mHealth tools in everyday life. Insights into the actual use of such tools have empirical importance and could contribute to our theoretical understanding of mHealth technologies. Our research is based on 23 interviews with the participants of a smartphone-based mobile health intervention aimed at increasing physical activity. We followed the principles of grounded theory during data collection and our analysis is framed by the domestication approach. Our results reveal that the intervention design can result in the participants feeling ill-represented by the reductive nature of the data they generate. The results also reveal the inadequacy between biomedical standards and the social contexts of use. In addition, we describe how middle-class users perceive step-counting through the prism of a moralizing ethos of self-responsibility. Our research has practical implications for the developers and participants of mHealth interventions and theoretical implications regarding mHealth as a societal practice. We also suggest that mHealth-related public policies may fail to reach certain population groups, namely those who do not share the values that surround those technologies and their uses.

N2  - Background: Women use fertility tracking apps (FTAs) for conception purposes, but user perspectives on FTA use for conception are largely unknown. In collaboration with SPD Clearblue, this study explored: how women trying to conceive use FTAs; women's knowledge of their conception chances; and women's feelings towards a potential natural conception prediction app (NCPA). Methods: A mixed methods design was used (online survey and phone interviews). Participants were women 18-40 years old actively trying to conceive. Results: The survey received 154 responses and 24 interviews were conducted. Thematic analysis of interviews found that women consider several factors before trying to conceive (ex. age, financial and job security, stability of relationship, etc.) and may adopt lifestyle and behaviour changes when trying (ex. increasing exercise, smoking cessation, diet changes, etc.). Survey results indicated that nearly all respondents were aware of FTAs (n = 146, 94.8%), however, several other fertility and conception information sources were also used (ex. health care providers, online sources, family and friends, etc.). Nearly all respondents reported they would use an NCPA (n = 153, 99.4%). During interviews women had positive feelings towards such an app due to it offering new and individualised information, but worried the app could provide upsetting information. Conclusion: This research elaborates on women's uses of and interest in FTAs. Stakeholders should use this research to reflect on current conception experiences and possibilities for improvement through development of an NCPA. Future research should seek opinions from a more diverse sample of women to inform the development of an inclusive NCPA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), while alcohol and cannabis retail sales increased. During the pandemic, we tested a tailored digital health solution, Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs), for reducing substance misuse. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N = 180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID>1) were enrolled June-August 2020. The primary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT). Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores, adjusting for baseline differences and attrition. Results: At baseline, the sample (age M = 40, SD = 12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD = 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45% multiple substances; 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 920 in-app text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701); 96% of completed lessons were rated positively; and 88% would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist, W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance use occasions (M = -9.1, SE = 2.0 vs. M = -3.3, SE = 1.8; p = .039). Secondary substance use and mood outcomes did not change significantly by group; however, reductions in substance use occasions correlated significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems, cravings, depression and anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value<.05). Conclusions: W-SUDs was associated with significant reductions in substance use occasions. Reduction in substance use occasions was associated with better outcomes, including improved mental health. W-SUDs satisfaction was high. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background: The onset of mental disorders typically occurs between the ages of 12 and 25, and the burden of mental health problems is the most consequential for this group. Indicated prevention interventions to target individuals with subclinical symptoms to prevent the transition to clinical levels of disorders, even leading to suicide, have shown to be effective. However, the threshold to seek help appears to be high. Digital interventions could offer a solution, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This implementation study will investigate the digital indicated prevention intervention ENgage YOung people Early (ENYOY), the Dutch version of the original Moderated Online Social Therapy Platform (MOST+) from Australia. In addition, the relationship between stress biomarkers, symptoms and outcome measures of youth using the platform will be investigated in this study. Methods: The MOST+ platform will be adapted, translated and developed for the situation in the Netherlands in collaboration with a Youth Panel. A prospective cohort of 125 young people (16-25 years) with beginning mental health complaints will be on the platform and followed for a year, of which 10 participants will have an additional smart watch and 10 participants will be asked to provide feedback about the platform. Data will be collected at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. Outcome measures are Psychological Distress assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), Social and occupational functioning (measures by the SOFAS), positive mental health indicators measured by the Positive Health Instrument, stress biomarkers with a smart-watch, website journeys of visitors, and feedback of youth about the platform. It will be a mixed-method study design, containing qualitative and quantitative measures. Discussion: This trial will specifically address young people with emerging mental health complaints, and offers a new approach for treatment in the Netherlands. Considering the waiting lists in (child and adolescent)-psychiatry and the increase in suicides among youth, early low-threshold and non-stigmatizing help to support young people with emerging psychiatric symptoms is of crucial importance. Moreover, this project aims to bridge the gap between child and adolescent and adult psychiatry. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by K. L. Cassidy et al. (see record 2020-63695-001). Smartphone and smart watch app-based treatments such as the one utilized in the study by Cassidy et al. represent a unique opportunity to expand the quality, affordability, and availability of interventions that promote wellbeing. These technologies are especially relevant in the wake of COVID-19 which has taken a significant toll on mental health and also radically transformed the delivery of health care. It is equally important to recognize that there are challenges of using mental health apps such as poor regulation of quality and privacy and inconsistencies in engagement. A key finding in the current study underscores the challenge of engagement. The retrospective analysis investigated the differences in outcomes between a clinician-assisted behavioral activation intervention and a self-guided app methodology. Striking differences in completion rates were found between the two methods. Only 10.8% of independent app users completed the intervention compared to 99.2% in the clinician assisted group. It is noteworthy that method did not affect psychological patient outcomes. Those who did complete the app-based intervention led to the same improvements in health behaviors and attitudes as those who worked with a clinician. As mental health apps are increasingly prescribed to supplement in-person treatment and help patients self-manage mental health conditions, it is not only important to know whether and which apps are effective, but it is also critical to understand the factors that make an app appealing.

N2  - Many speech-language pathologists (SLPs) recently adopted a live, synchronous online distribution of clinical services due to physical distancing measures aimed at bringing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak under control. Few SLPs had received training in telepractice to prepare them for changes from an in-person service delivery model to synchronous telepractice. The new telepractice environment may alter vocal behaviors and communication interactions in such a way that negatively impacts voice production. Thus, delivering synchronous online clinical services may require that SLPs adopt novel prevention strategies for avoiding phonogenic voice problems. Guided by two complementary injury frameworks, the Haddon Matrix and the Haddon Countermeasures, this article provides an overview of potential factors associated with phonogenic voice problems among SLPs in telepractice and proposes possible prevention strategies to maintain optimal vocal health and function with synchronous modes of online clinical practice.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - AIM: To describe the development process and explain the outcomes of Fex-Can Fertility, as elf-help web-based psychoeducational intervention aiming to alleviate reproductive concerns in young adults with cancer. METHODS: The thesis comprises five papers; one cross-sectional survey study of oncologists' and hematologists' fertility-related communication (I), one study describing the development of the Fex-Can intervention in a participatory process (II), one feasibility study testing the preliminary version of the web-based program (III), and one RCT testing the effect of the final intervention (IV). Study V was a qualitative interview study examining participants' experiences in relation to the theory behind the intervention. RESULTS: The results of the five papers are presented according to the structure of a process evaluation. The context of the intervention was one where physicians in cancer care often but not always talk about fertility with their patients. Persons contributing to, requesting and participating in the Fex-Can intervention were predominantly female and well educated. The intervention was developed in a participatory process with people representative of the target group while keeping with theoretical underpinnings in psychology and eHealth technologies. Feasibility testing indicated that the intervention would be acceptable to users, but recruitment and retainment was below the anticipated figures. The RCT was underpowered and had modest outcomes, with significant effects only on concerns about genetic risks and on treatment-related fertility knowledge, where the effect sizes were moderate. Mechanisms of impact were investigated mainly in the interview study. Participants described how the intervention had supported their needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy, but also that some missed tailoring to their specific needs and that keeping up with the intervention was too time-consuming. Degree of activity did not seem to have a clear relationship with effect of the intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Despite meticulous preparation and adherence to every step of the framework for intervention development, the present intervention did not meet our expectations for efficacy in reducing fertility-related distress. Challenges include refining recruitment strategies, finding appropriate main outcome measures and ways to further ensure active participation. Still, the Fex-Can Fertility intervention was appreciated by most users and no adverse events were recorded, suggesting it can be of value if offered as a supplement to standard psychosocial support in clinical cancer care.

N2  - It is noted that smartphone digital phenotyping, also known as personal sensing, offers an accessible and scalable means to deliver precision mental health across all conditions - but holds a high potential for those with clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Smartphones are finally the right tool for CHR research and care delivery because they can interpret and act on data to offer just-in-time adaptive interventions that increase access to care. Precision clinical trials and personalized prevention for CHR are possible, and smartphone tools like digital phenotyping offer an actionable, low-cost, highly scalable and 'shovel ready' avenue for further exploration. The ability to advance CHR care today through research advancing personalized prediction and just-in-time adaptive interventions is buttressed by the potential to advance mechanistic understanding to deliver personalized prevention tomorrow.

N2  - More than 200 million people suffer from depression per year, and a fraction of those people access mental health care. If depression goes untreated, it can have fatal consequences, but those who receive treatment can learn effective coping skills to reduce long-term effects. The digital world introduced new ways to manage depression, along with other mental health conditions. Internet-based treatment is considered effective, and now with smart/mobile devices, the next step was to take advantage of this unique platform. Mental health/wellness apps can be downloaded on any mobile device and used when needed. Further, apps can supplement in-person treatment and possibly as a stand-alone intervention to improve mental health and well-being. This research focused on the efficacy of app-based treatment on depression and other mood states. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Time for transformation: Supporting community health workers on the path to gender equity.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Community Health Workers (CHWs) are increasingly relied upon to supplement human resources for health shortages in low-and middle-income countries. CHWs occupy a unique interface position between communities and the health system and are able to reach the most marginalised communities. Unlike other cadres, they do not operate out of an institutional space, but instead operate within the gendered boundaries of their communities. The literature review conducted as part of this thesis demonstrates the multiple ways gender norms and relations interact with broader contextual factors and other axes of inequity to impact the working lives of CHWs. Yet these 'software' considerations are not reflected in policies which establish and guide CHW programming. This thesis aims to answer the following research question: How do gender norms and relations shape both CHWs' working lives, and how do CHW policies and guidelines play out across differing contexts? A new framework is presented which demonstrates how gender roles and relations impact CHWs' working lives across various levels from the individual, to community and health systems. The thesis then uses mixed qualitative interview techniques to understand the processes of CHW policy making at a national and international level (via key informant interviews, n=11) and to what degree gender is considered within the development process. Finally, the thesis explores how different policies play out within two distinct country settings - Mozambique and Ethiopia. In Mozambique qualitative techniques (IDIs, n=31and FGDs, n=3) are employed with CHWs, their supervisors, community leaders and key informants to explore the gendered implications of policies relating to the recruitment and retention of CHWs. Further, it investigates how gender roles and relations affect livelihood negotiations for male and female CHWs. In Ethiopia qualitative techniques (IDIs, n=19 and FGDs, n=8) are employed with CHWs, their supervisors and community leaders to unearth the gendered impact of new guidelines surrounding the use of mobile phone technology (mHealth). The findings are analysed against a gender framework to discuss how gender equitable the mHealth intervention is for the all-female cadre of CHWs. This thesis finds that although gender roles and relations impact the working lives of CHWs - gender is not considered comprehensively in CHW human resource policies. This may be in part because context-relevant evidence, tools and guidance on how to encourage gender equitable CHW programming and policies are lacking. This is compounded by a lack of national sex-disaggregated data on CHWs, high levels of fragmentation of policy actors and limited input from gender experts and departments. The policy making process is not a simple one and is inherently shaped by power relations. This complexity is mirrored in how CHW policies play out on the ground - existing gendered power dynamics limit female CHW's choices over their livelihoods in Mozambique, and in Ethiopia, new gendered power dynamics were created among HEWs with access to mHealth. The findings demonstrate that CHW policies and guidelines do not exist in a vacuum but are mediated and shaped by gender relations and other contextual factors that operate across individual, household, community and institutional levels. The findings also provide a base for concrete suggestions for gender equitable CHW policy making, which are presented in the discussion. People working within the health system should reflect on its role as a gendered institution, aiming to transform gender inequities from within. This is critical at the community health system level, which is increasingly relied upon to reach marginalised communities. The time is ripe to enact policy change to ensure CHW programming is more gender equitable and responds effectively to the differing needs of the men...

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Problem Statement: Family has been shown to be the greatest influence on the formation of children's eating habits (Gerards, Niermann, Gevers, Eussen & Kremers, 2016) and a lack of nutrition knowledge among caregivers of children can contribute to childhood obesity.Purpose: This study's purpose is to increase nutritional knowledge of caregivers of children through the online nutrition education program, Use of Social Media for Delivery of Nutrition Education to Caregivers of Children in a Faith Based Organization. Methods: This program delivered nutrition education through a "Facebook Secret Group" (FSG) linked to Lifehouse Church in Washington County, MD. Providing community nutrition education in a Faith Based Organization (FBO), combined with an online, social media platform to deliver education creates a non-threatening, flexible atmosphere for education. The 6-week, online intervention employed various types of media to provide education and interaction with participants of the Lifehouse Church's FSG. Social media was a platform that most of the population could be involved by smart phone application, tablet application or personal computer. Improvement in nutritional knowledge was measured using a pre- post-survey method. The sampling was ofconvenience. Results: Results from each implementation and collectively were statistically analyzed by t tests. The results demonstrated an increase in nutritional knowledge after educational intervention. Although the results were positive, due to the characteristics of the participant demographics, they are not generalizable, and more research utilizing social media as a method of delivering online health education is needed.Significance: Nutrition education has been shown to improve nutritional knowledge, promote positive behavioral changes, and decrease risk factors for chronic illnesses in adults and children (Rustad & Smith, 2013). The study demonstrated the effectiveness of social media for online health education, the scope and effect of an FBO for health education, and evaluation of the effectiveness of non-traditional methods to increase nutrition knowledge.

N2  - This article discusses the promotion of optimal sexual and reproductive health with mobile health tools for Black women. In the United States, Black women are disproportionately affected by adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes compared with women of other races and ethnicities. As mHealth research gains traction, however, few interventions have been developed to address the sexual and reproductive health needs of Black women in the United States, and even fewer studies have investigated the user retention rates of mHealth interventions among this population. The authors highlight the particular importance of mHealth research in evaluating factors that may help promote engagement among Black women.

N2  - Chatbots represent new opportunities for low-threshold preventive mental health support to youths. To provide needed knowledge regarding how to design chatbots for this purpose, we present an exploratory design study where we designed and evaluated a prototype chatbot to complement the work of school nurses in the school health service. The prototype was designed with particular regard for preventive mental health support. The design process involved school nurses, digital health workers, and youths. Through user insight activities, we identified four types of support to be provided through the chatbot: informational, relational, processual, and referral. We explored these four types of support through concept development and prototyping. These results are discussed as a potential basis for a framework for understanding youths' needs regarding chatbots for preventive mental health support. When discussing the study findings, we point out how the study contributes to theory and practice and suggest avenues for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Physical activity in early life and adolescence can help set the path for lifelong health in adulthood. The frequency of moderate to vigorous physical activity surveyed in adolescents in 2010 was found to be correlated with increased sleep satisfaction and decreased stress, highlighting that physical activity is helpful in many aspects of teens' personal health and well-being. As technology has continued to evolve and become integrated into the daily lives of adolescents, both benefits and risks to the health and safety of children and teens of all backgrounds have been considered. Digital media-based health and behavior change interventions may be a way to improve health outcomes for adolescents. Many platforms of media that influence physical activity include video games, active videogames, eHealth/mHealth interventions, web-based activities, smartphones, wearable devices, and social media. This chapter defines various media platforms, reviews the known positive and negative influences on adolescent physical activity, and calls out potential areas of research expansion. Adolescents enjoy playing video games, especially when individualizations are made for specific populations. There are core themes that help increase consistent participation including concepts of competition, incentives, and peer influences. Further study is needed to discover optimal combination of these themes. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Engagement with conventional weight management group programmes is low. Objective: To understand participant experience of accessing an adapted programme via videoconference. Participants: Adults with obesity (BMI >= 35kg/m2), referred to an NHS Dietetics service in Wales, were offered a group videoconference weight management programme as an optional alternative to in-person groups. Thirteen participants (mean age 48.5 +/- 20.2 years, 8 female) recruited to two videoconference groups were interviewed. Study Design: A Registered Dietitian delivered a behavioural programme using Skype for Business in 10 sessions over 6 months. Participants joined the groups from any Internet-connected device with a webcam. Participant perspectives were audiorecorded in one-to-one, semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using self-determination theory as a theoretical framework. Results: Ten themes were identified, three relating to service engagement and seven relating to behaviour change facilitation. Key themes in engagement included 'reduced burden', described as saving time and travel and 'reduced threat' as participants perceived joining a group from home as less daunting compared to attending in-person. Despite reporting some initial technical difficulties with establishing video and audio connection, participants described beneficial peer support although not physically with other group members. Conclusion: Accessing a group weight management programme via videoconference may be the preferred option for some participants, overcoming some of the barriers to access to standard in-person programmes, particularly in rural areas. Participants are able to experience peer support via videoconference. During the COVID-19 pandemic, weight management programmes could utilize videoconference groups to continue to provide support.

N2  - This study explores current drinking practices and attitudes of college students and design opportunities for encouraging safe and responsible drinking behaviors in this population. With 86 participants in total, we conducted surveys, interviews, and a two-week user study that involved the use of BACtrack Mobile Pro, an FDA-approved personal breathalyzer which can be connected to a smartphone app. For the user study, we conducted pre-study and weekly surveys, user experience evaluations, and in-depth post-study interviews with 24 college students who regularly consume alcohol. We identified and compared two groups of participants based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), which is a screening test for risky drinking behaviors. We propose a new system, smartphone app user interface, and experiences based on our findings. Finally, we discuss the role and implications of future technological interventions that could lead to safe and responsible drinking behaviors among college students.

N2  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious intervention for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Digital CBT may provide a scalable means of delivering CBT at a population level. We investigated the efficacy of a novel digital CBT program in those with GAD for outcomes of anxiety, worry, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life. Methods: This online, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial compared digital CBT with waitlist control in 256 participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. Digital CBT (Daylight), was delivered using participants' own smartphones. Online assessments took place at baseline (Week 0; immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (Week 3; from randomization), post-intervention (Week 6; primary endpoint), and follow-up (Week 10). Results: Overall, 256 participants were randomized and intention-to-treat analysis found Daylight reduced symptoms of anxiety compared with waitlist control at post-intervention, reflecting a large effect size (adjusted difference [95% CI]: 3.22 [2.14, 4.31], d = 1.08). Significant improvements were found for measures of worry; depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life. Conclusion: Digital CBT (Daylight) appears to be safe and efficacious for symptoms of anxiety, worry, and further measures of mental health compared with waitlist control in individuals with GAD.

N2  - The article presents a brief description of the design, content and initial outcome of the app developed specifically for adolescents, "BlueIce". To maximize the acceptability of mHealth interventions, individuals with lived experience of mental health difficulties should be involved in their design, layout and content. This ensures that the needs and preferences of the end-users are met thereby increasing acceptability, tackling potential barriers of engagement and use and reducing attrition rates. BlueIce was co-designed with young people with a lived experience of self-harm. A series of workshops were established to explore the concept (would an app be helpful?), what should it look like (examples of apps liked and used), the design (font, colours, flow) and content (evidence based and ideas young people found helpful). Workshops were undertaken with clinicians to focus on content before developing a beta version. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are on the rise in the United States, and adolescent girls (15-19 years old) are more susceptible to acquiring STIs than their male peers. The co-occurrence of alcohol use and sexual risk taking contribute significantly to STI acquisition. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are ideally suited for our target population and have demonstrated increases in STI testing in young people, as well as reductions in alcohol use. Objective: This pilot study used both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the views of adolescent girls (age range 15-19 years old; 74.6%, 279/374 white) on the desired qualities and content of an mHealth app for sexual health. Methods: We conducted nine 60-min in-depth interviews (IDIs) to gather information and identify themes of sexual health and alcohol use, and we tested the feasibility of using a two-week social media campaign to collect survey information regarding sexual health risk in adolescent girls. Results: We iteratively coded IDIs and identified major themes around pressure of alcohol use, lack of STI knowledge, male pressure to not use condoms, and pregnancy as a worse outcome than STIs. Results from the web-based survey on risky health behaviors, which was completed by 367 participants, support the use of a sexual health app designed for girls. Conclusions: Future work will integrate these themes to inform the development of a culturally sensitive mHealth app to prevent STIs among adolescent girls.

N2  - Background: Sleep hygiene is important for maintaining good sleep and reducing insomnia. Objective: This study examined the long-term efficacy of a theory-based app (including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], theory of planned behavior [TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene among insomnia patients. Methods: The study was a 2-arm single-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group that used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT-I], n = 156) or a control group that received only patient education (PE, n = 156) through the app. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postintervention. Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included attitudes toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self-monitoring, behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in outcomes between the two groups and across time. Results: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT-I group compared with the PE group (P = .02 at 1 month, P = .04 at 3 months, and P = .02 at 6 months) as were sleep quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived behavioral control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with self-regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of the intervention on outcomes. Conclusions: Health care providers might consider using a CBT-I app to improve sleep among insomnia patients. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - A wide array of digital supports (such as apps) have been developed for the autism community, many of which have little or no evidence to support their effectiveness. A Delphi study methodology was used to develop a consensus on what constitutes good evidence for digital supports among the broader autism community, including autistic people and their families, as well as autism-related professionals and researchers. A four-phase Delphi study consultation with 27 panel members resulted in agreement on three categories for which evidence is required: reliability, engagement and effectiveness of the technology. Consensus was also reached on four key sources of evidence for these three categories: hands-on experience, academic sources, expert views and online reviews. These were differentially weighted as sources of evidence within these three categories. Lay abstract: Digital supports are any type of technologies that have been intentionally developed to improve daily living in some way. A wide array of digital supports (such as apps) have been developed for the autism community specifically, but there is little or no evidence of whether they work or not. This study sought to identify what types of evidence the autistic community valued and wanted to see provided to enable an informed choice to be made regarding digital supports. A consensus was developed between autistic people and their families, practitioners (such as therapists and teachers) as well as researchers, to identify the core aspects of evidence that everyone agreed were useful. In all, 27 people reached agreement on three categories for which evidence is required: reliability, engagement and the effectiveness of the technology. Consensus was also reached on four key sources of evidence for these three categories: hands-on experience, academic sources, expert views and online reviews. The resulting framework allows for any technology to be evaluated for the level of evidence identifying how effective it is. The framework can be used by autistic people, their families, practitioners and researchers to ensure that decisions concerning the provision of support for autistic people is informed by evidence, that is, 'evidence-based practice'.

N2  - Although behavioral therapies are effective for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), access for patients is limited. Attention-bias modification (ABM), a cognitive-training intervention designed to reduce attention bias for threat, can be broadly disseminated using technology. We remotely tested an ABM mobile app for PTSD. Participants (N = 689) were randomly assigned to personalized ABM, nonpersonalized ABM, or placebo training. ABM was a modified dot-probe paradigm delivered daily for 12 sessions. Personalized ABM included words selected using a recommender algorithm. Placebo included only neutral words. Primary outcomes (PTSD and anxiety) and secondary outcomes (depression and PTSD clusters) were collected at baseline, after training, and at 5-week-follow-up. Mechanisms assessed during treatment were attention bias and self-reported threat sensitivity. No group differences emerged on outcomes or attention bias. Nonpersonalized ABM showed greater declines in self-reported threat sensitivity than placebo (p = .044). This study constitutes the largest mobile-based trial of ABM to date. Findings do not support the effectiveness of mobile ABM for PTSD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - While technology-based interventions show promise in certain populations of American youth, the technology may intrinsically widen intergenerational communication chasms associated with youth's increased access to Smartphone technologies. The authors examined self-reported exposure to sexual and reproductive health information and evaluated its relationship with sexual risk behaviors with American Indian youth. Approximately 296 students, ages of 15-18 years old, were surveyed to examine self-reported exposure and attitudes to information received about sexual intercourse, reproduction, and social media use in relation to sexual risk behaviors. Results indicate that information received regarding sexual intercourse and birth control from intra-familial network members was associated with more engagement in sex, and that increased social media use to talk or learn about sex was associated with not using a condom at the last sexual encounter. We advise that researchers and programmers considering technology-based interventions with AI communities carefully consider the gravity of investing preventive resources into technology-based interventions that may further deepen communication gaps that youth experience within their community networks.

N2  - Background: Although effective treatments exist for diagnostic and subthreshold-level eating disorders (EDs), a significant proportion of affected individuals do not receive help. Interventions translated for delivery through smartphone apps may be one solution towards reducing this treatment gap. However, evidence for the efficacy of smartphones apps for EDs is lacking. We developed a smartphone app based on the principles and techniques of transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy for EDs and evaluated it through a pre-registered randomized controlled trial. Methods: Symptomatic individuals (those who reported the presence of binge eating) were randomly assigned to the app (n = 197) or waiting list (n = 195). Of the total sample, 42 and 31% exhibited diagnostic-level bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder symptoms, respectively. Assessments took place at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks post-randomization. Analyses were intention-to-treat. The primary outcome was global levels of ED psychopathology. Secondary outcomes were other ED symptoms, impairment, and distress. Results: Intervention participants reported greater reductions in global ED psychopathology than the control group at post-test (d = -0.80). Significant effects were also observed for secondary outcomes (d's = -0.30 to -0.74), except compensatory behavior frequency. Symptom levels remained stable at follow-up. Participants were largely satisfied with the app, although the overall post-test attrition rate was 35%. Conclusion: Findings highlight the potential for this app to serve as a cost-effective and easily accessible intervention for those who cannot receive standard treatment. The capacity for apps to be flexibly integrated within current models of mental health care delivery may prove vital for addressing the unmet needs of people with EDs.

N2  - Background: Digital health is well-positioned in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) to revolutionize health care due, in part, to increasing mobile phone access and internet connectivity. This paper evaluates the underlying factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. Objective: The objective of this study is to identify the current digital health projects and studies being carried out in Pakistan, as well as the key stakeholders involved in these initiatives. We aim to follow a mixed-methods strategy and to evaluate these projects and studies through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify the internal and external factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. Methods: This study aims to evaluate digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan with mixed methods. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained from field surveys were categorized according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended building blocks for health systems research, and the data were analyzed using a SWOT analysis strategy. Results: Of the digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan, 51 are studied. Of these projects, 46% (23/51) used technology for conducting research, 30% (15/51) used technology for implementation, and 12% (6/51) used technology for app development. The health domains targeted were general health (23/51, 46%), immunization (13/51, 26%), and diagnostics (5/51, 10%). Smartphones and devices were used in 55% (28/51) of the interventions, and 59% (30/51) of projects included plans for scaling up. Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) was used in 31% (16/51) of projects, and 74% (38/51) of interventions were being evaluated. The barriers faced by developers during the implementation phase included the populations' inability to use the technology or mobile phones in 21% (11/51) of projects, costs in 16% (8/51) of projects, and privacy concerns in 12% (6/51) of projects. Conclusions: We conclude that while digital health has a promising future in Pakistan, it is still in its infancy at the time of this study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increase in demand for digital health and implementation of health outcomes following global social distancing protocols, especially in LMICs. Hence, there is a need for active involvement by public and private organizations to regulate, mobilize, and expand the digital health sector for the improvement of health care systems in countries.

N2  - With the advent of various applications of innovative health technology, scholars from various disciplines, health practitioners, and health industries seek to find better ways to use new technology for health promotion. This book examines how various technologies can be used for attitude and behavior changes for health promotion. Specifically, it focuses on technology as a tool that delivers media content based on an understanding of distinct features of each technology. It covers why and how specific technology (e.g., virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and social media) is effective in promoting good health and also suggests how it should be designed, utilized, and evaluated for health interventions. This book provides unique perspectives. The focus is not only on the media content (e.g., what the health-related contents on the media do to people) but also on the distinct features of media/technology for health. In this book, world-renowned experts share their understanding of each technology as well as their experiences with using the technology for health promotion. The authors hope that the readers receive valuable information from this book that will help them design health technology interventions or research projects. This edited book is primarily written for academics who are interested in using technology for health promotion. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of the topic, this book is not limited to a specific discipline. Rather, it can be beneficial for academics in diverse disciplines, such as Communication, Public Health, Information Science, Computer Science, Medicine, and Psychology. Additionally, the book also has value for health practitioners. It provides meaningful implications for practice, and they are discussed throughout the chapters. It can provide valuable information to practitioners, who are looking for theory-driven health intervention strategies using technology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Video games are becoming increasingly common to treat physical or psychological conditions. An emerging field of study suggests that playing video games can induce positive structural changes in brain regions associated with mental health disorders. It also established that mental health video game apps have a high attrition rate, where attrition is described as premature discontinuation, nonusage, and nonadherence to the app. Practitioners and researchers have recommended several approaches to manage attrition when implementing behavioral technology interventions. These recommendations include improving usability, increasing incentives, and augmenting adherence via the use of reminders. Persuasive messages designed to change people's attributions of causality and the screen size in which these messages are shown can influence behavioral and self-reported engagement with a mental health game app. Messages targeting depression causality beliefs can be used to enhance user engagement with self-help video game apps for depression. This chapter reviews two studies that chart new ways for increasing engagement with mental health apps by showing that we have the capacity to increase mental health app engagement and reduce attrition with self-help mental health apps.

N2  - Smartphone ownership estimates indicate the vast majority of young people are engaging with smartphone devices. The medium offers a promising opportunity for psychologists to connect with young people seeking help to traverse challenges with mental health, behaviour, learning and wellbeing. However, the views of young people using apps alongside face-to-face therapy remain largely unexplored. Given that clients make the single strongest contribution to therapeutic outcomes it is important to consider the perspectives of adolescents in clinical settings. Using semistructured qualitative interviews, the experiences of seven Australian secondary school-aged adolescents (12-18 years) involved in app-integrated therapy were explored. Thematic analysis resulted in the identification of eight key themes: Between-sessions, Introduction, Responsive, Age, Mindfulness-Meditation, Connection, Knowledge, and App features. Recommending apps appears to encourage young people to take ownership of their therapy, affording opportunities for self-reflection and rehearsal of valuable skills. Further research focused on understanding the views of young people utilising apps with therapy is needed to maximise potential therapeutic benefits. Preliminary practice recommendations and future research directions are proposed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Prior to developing a successful eHealth intervention, it is important that we explore stakeholders' capacity to adapt to eHealth. Objective: To explore what factors influence the use eHealth services from the perspectives of families of children with hearing loss and professionals who support families as they transition into early intervention. Methods: A qualitative study incorporating semi-structured in-depth interviews was conducted with families (n = 17) and professionals (n = 11). Interview topic guides were developed based on the COM-B model of behaviour change to explore barriers and facilitators related to capability, opportunity, and motivation. Results: The COM-B model captured several factors that may influence the use eHealth interventions for families of children with hearing loss. The capability factors included computer literacy and familiarity with social media. The opportunity factors were access to online resources, reliable Internet, and affordable equipment. Professionals' and families' preferences and a culture of face-to-face services were also identified as barriers for using eHealth. The motivation factors included families' and professionals' confidence in using technology and beliefs that there were benefits (e.g., saving travel) associated with using eHealth services. In contrast, beliefs that eHealth may be difficult to set up and not able to replace in-person communication identified as barriers to families and professionals adopting eHealth interventions. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicated that implementation of an eHealth intervention could be facilitated by addressing the barriers in stakeholders' capabilities, opportunities (e.g., equipment and social support), and motivation (e.g., negative beliefs about eHealth) before developing eHealth services.

N2  - Chronic migraine, a disabling condition that affects the 2% of migraine population, is frequently associated with medication overuse that makes this condition difficult to treat. Many prior investigations have affirmed the efficacy and importance of having patients withdraw from all offending medications contributing to this condition, as well as point to the need to carefully follow patients after withdrawal to avoid relapses, minimize the chances of resuming recurrent overuse and maintain, hopefully improve, the clinical benefits of whatever concurrent therapeutic approach was provided. Also, clinical results are enhanced when traditional therapies are combined with behavioral approaches, in particular mindfulness that help patients become more conscious about their symptoms and learn techniques for managing pain without medications. At the Besta Institute, we have been following a cohort of patients who have completed a supervised medication withdrawal, which is followed by a specific prophylaxis for migraine, but also a specially designed program for mindfulness practice, that is administered for 6 weekly-45- min sessions to patients in small groups. As the coronavirus began to spread rapidly throughout Italy, our in-clinic approach was no longer advisable or feasible, as patients were unable to attend sessions on a regular basis. Thus, our aim in this study was to investigate the feasibility and the effectiveness of mindfulness by smart phone combined to video calls for clinical evaluation and follow-up of patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse after withdrawal program and to confirm the effectiveness after 1 year.

N2  - This patient perspective highlights the role of patients in the innovation and codesign of digital mental health technology. Though digital mental health apps have evolved and become highly functional, many still act as data collection silos without adequate support for patients to understand and investigate potentially meaningful inferences in their own data. Few digital health platforms respect the patient's agency and curiosity, allowing the individual to wear the hat of researcher and data scientist and share their experiences and insight with their clinicians. This case is cowritten with an individual with lived experiences of schizophrenia who has decided to openly share their name and experiences to share with others the methods and results of their curiosity and encourage and inspire others to follow their curiosity as well.

N2  - Background: Digital mental health interventions leverage digital communication technology to address the mental health needs of populations. Culturally adapting interventions can lead to a successful, scalable mental health intervention implementation, and cultural adaptation of digital mental health interventions is a critical component to implementing interventions at scale within contexts where mental health services are not well supported. Objective: The study aims to describe the cultural adaptation of a digital mental health intervention Step-by-Step in order to address depression among Chinese young adults. Methods: Cultural adaptation was carried out in four phases following Ecological Validity Model: (1) stage setting and expert consultation; (2) preliminary content adaptation; (3) iterative content adaptation with community members; (4) finalized adaptation with community feedback meetings. Cognitive interviewing was applied to probe for relevance, acceptability, comprehensibility, and completeness of illustrations and text. Six mental health experts and 34 Chinese young adults were recruited for key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Results: We adapted the text and illustrations to fit the culture among Chinese young adults. Eight elements of the intervention were chosen as the targets of cultural adaptation (e.g., language, metaphors, content). Samples of major adaptations included: adding scenarios related to university life (relevance), changing leading characters from a physician to a peer and a cartoon (acceptability), incorporating two language versions (traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese) in the intervention (comprehensibility), and maintaining fundamental therapeutic components (completeness). Conclusion: This study showed the utility of using Ecological Validity Model and a four-point procedure framework for cultural adaptation and achieved a culturally appropriate version of the Step-by-Step program for Chinese young adults.

N2  - Objective: Consistent self-monitoring of dietary intake, weight, and physical activity predicts better outcomes during behavioral weight loss, but the factors that influence self-monitoring adherence are not well understood. This study attempted to fill gaps in the existing literature by examining whether pre-treatment eating behaviors predict adherence to digital self-monitoring during a behavioral weight loss program. Method: Participants (N = 77) reported on binge eating, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating at baseline, and were instructed to self-monitor their food intake, weight, and physical activity using digital devices (food logging app, Fitbit, and wireless "smart" scale) throughout the 12-week treatment. Adherence to self-monitoring was assessed using data captured from these devices. Results: Greater baseline binge eating severity predicted greater adherence to self-monitoring of weight (rho = 0.25, p = .03) and eating (rho = 0.25, p = .03), but not self-monitoring of physical activity. Uncontrolled eating and emotional eating did not significantly predict self-monitoring adherence. Conclusions: In contrast to previous research, this study found that participants with greater pre-treatment binge eating severity had better adherence to self-monitoring of eating, and for the first time established a relationship between binge eating severity and digital self-monitoring of weight in behavioral weight loss. Individuals with greater pre-treatment binge eating may exhibit characteristics, such as motivation or rigidity, that are beneficial during the initial period of weight loss. Future studies should determine if there are features of analogue versus digital self-monitoring that may explain this pattern of findings, and examine these associations longitudinally.

N2  - This study examined certified peer specialists' perceptions of the barriers and facilitators to mobile health (mHealth) engagement. A total of 267 certified peer specialists from 38 states completed an online survey. Of this sample, 74 certified peer specialists completed open-ended questions. Data were analyzed from the 74 respondents who responded to open-ended questions. Certified peer specialists identified previously unidentified facilitators including the augmented use of certified peer specialists in combination with mHealth to improve engagement. One emerging theme identified was the belief that mHealth interventions may promote social isolation if not designed appropriately. Certified peer specialists appear to prefer using tablets instead of smartphones. Integrating certified peer specialists' perspectives of barriers and facilitators to mHealth engagement may promote initial and sustained mHealth engagement among consumers with serious mental illness. Future research using implementation science frameworks should examine these previously identified barriers and facilitators to mHealth engagement as correlates and/or predictors of engagement among service users.

N2  - Background: Recovery from stress is a predictive factor for cardiovascular health, and heart rate variability (HRV) is suggested to be an index of how well people physiologically recover from stress. Biofeedback and mindfulness interventions that include guided breathing have been shown to be effective in increasing HRV and facilitating stress recovery. Objective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a brief app-based breathing intervention (BioBase) in enhancing physiological recovery among employees who were induced to cognitive and emotional stress. Methods: In total, we recruited 75 full-time employees. Interbeat (RR) intervals were recorded continuously for 5 min at baseline and during cognitive and emotional stress induction. The session ended with a 5-min recovery period during which participants were randomly allocated into 3 conditions: app-based breathing (BioBase), mindfulness body scan, or control. Subjective tension was assessed at the end of each period. Results: Subjective tension significantly increased following stress induction. HRV significantly decreased following the stress period. In the recovery phase, the root mean square of successive RR interval differences (P = .002), the percentage of successive RR intervals that differed by > 50 ms (P = .008), and high frequency (P = .01) were significantly higher in the BioBase breathing condition than in the mindfulness body scan and the control groups. Conclusions: Biofeedback breathing interventions digitally delivered through a commercially available app can be effective in facilitating stress recovery among employees. These findings contribute to the mobile health literature on the beneficial effects of brief app-based breathing interventions on employees' cardiovascular health.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed evidence-based low back pain (LBP) management smartphone application. Design: A double-blinded randomized controlled trial where participants randomly assigned to either an experimental group (EG) or a control group (CG). Setting: Governmental and private institutions. Participants: About 40 office workers, aged 30 to 55 years, had pain due to non-specific LBP > 3 on Visual Analogue Scale, and with pain chronicity > 3 months. Interventions: The EG received full version of the application 'Relieve my back' included evidence-based instructions and therapeutic exercises for LBP management, whereas the CG received placebo version included instructions about nutrition. Main measures: Primary outcome measures included pain measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), disability measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and quality of life measured by Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Results: Following six weeks of using the application, compared to CG, the EG group demonstrated significant decrease in pain intensity (-3.45 (2.21) vs -0.11 (1.66), P < 0.001), in ODI score (-11.05 (10.40) vs -0.58 (9.0), P = 0.002), and significant increase in physical component of SF-12 (12.85 (17.20) vs -4.63 (12.04), P = 0.001). Conclusion: 'Relieve my back' application might be efficacious in reducing pain and disability and improving the quality of life of office workers with non-specific LBP.

N2  - Background: The burden of HIV-related stigma is associated with disparities in linkage to HIV care and viral suppression. The Positive Peers smartphone application aims to provide young people living with HIV with a supportive virtual community to counteract perceived stigma and better manage their illness. Method: A mixed-methods study that included a prospective survey and in-depth interviewing was conducted with young adults living with HIV, aged 13 to 34 years (n = 128). As part of a larger study, participants used the Positive Peers mobile application and reported demographic data, perceived stigma, and other psychosocial variables at enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months (n = 128). Select participants (n = 15) described their experiences in audio-recorded qualitative interviews. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed for potential themes and patterns. Results: A longitudinal multivariate model was developed to assess changes in stigma over the study period, overall, and with respect to participant characteristics. Baseline and 6-month stigma scores were higher for White and Other ethnicity persons relative to Black participants. At the 12-month time point, no statistical differences in stigma scores based on ethnicity were apparent. Interviews revealed Positive Peers as a nondiscriminatory community that offered a sense of belonging that appeared to have a restorative effect on negative self-image. Conclusions: Positive Peers provides a protected virtual space where young people living with HIV can converge in the common desire to support similar others. Mobile health applications that offer peer interaction may provide a persistent sense of belonging that neutralizes internalized stigmas in addition to benefits derived from application activity.

N2  - Background: Typically, web-based consumer health information is considered more beneficial for people with high levels of education and income. No evidence shows that equity-oriented information offers equal benefits to all. This is important for parents of low socioeconomic status (SES; low levels of education and income and usually a low level of literacy). Objective: This study is based on a conceptual framework of information outcomes. In light of this, it aims to compare the perception of the outcomes of web-based parenting information in low-SES mothers with that of other mothers and explore the perspective of low-SES mothers on contextual factors and information needs and behavior associated with these outcomes. Methods: A participatory mixed methods research was conducted in partnership with academic researchers and Naitre et grandir (N&G) editors. N&G is a magazine, website, and newsletter that offers trustworthy parenting information on child development, education, health, and well-being in a format that is easy to read, listen, or watch. Quantitative component (QUAN) included a 3-year longitudinal observational web survey; participants were mothers of 0- to 8-year-old children. For each N&G newsletter, the participants'perception regarding the outcomes of specific N&G webpages was gathered using a content-validated Information Assessment Method (IAM) questionnaire. Differences between participants of low SES versus others were estimated. Qualitative component (QUAL) was interpretive; participants were low-SES mothers. The thematic analysis of interview transcripts identified participants'characteristics and different sources of information depending on information needs. Findings from the two components were integrated (QUAN+QUAL integration) through the conceptual framework and assimilated into the description of an ideal-typical mother of low SES (Kate). A narrative describes Kate's perception of the outcomes of web-based parenting information and her perspective on contextual factors, information needs, and behavior associated with these outcomes. Results: QUAN-a total of 1889 participants completed 2447 IAM responses (50 from mothers of low SES and 2397 from other mothers). N&G information was more likely to help low-SES participants to better understand something, decrease worries, and increase self-confidence in decision making. QUAL-the 40 participants (21 N&G users and 19 nonusers) used 4 information sources in an iterative manner: websites, forums, relatives, and professionals. The integration of QUAN and QUAL findings provides a short narrative, Kate, which summarizes the main findings. Conclusions: This is the first study comparing perceptions of information outcomes in low-SES mothers with those of other mothers. Findings suggest that equity-oriented, web-based parenting information can offer equal benefits to all, including low-SES mothers. The short narrative, Kate, can be quickly read by decision policy makers, for example, web editors, and might encourage them to reach the underserved and provide and assess trustworthy web-based consumer health information in a format that is easy to read, listen, or watch.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of wireless, interrelated, and connected digital devices that can collect, send, and store data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The IoT promises many benefits to streamlining and enhancing health care delivery to proactively predict health issues and diagnose, treat, and monitor patients both in and out of the hospital. Worldwide, government leaders and decision makers are implementing policies to deliver health care services using technology and more so in response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic. It is now becoming increasingly important to understand how established and emerging IoT technologies can support health systems to deliver safe and effective care. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to provide an overview of the current IoT technology in health care, outline how IoT devices are improving health service delivery, and outline how IoT technology can affect and disrupt global health care in the next decade. The potential of IoT-based health care is expanded upon to theorize how IoT can improve the accessibility of preventative public health services and transition our current secondary and tertiary health care to be a more proactive, continuous, and coordinated system. Finally, this paper will deal with the potential issues that IoT-based health care generates, barriers to market adoption from health care professionals and patients alike, confidence and acceptability, privacy and security, interoperability, standardization and remuneration, data storage, and control and ownership. Corresponding enablers of IoT in current health care will rely on policy support, cybersecurity-focused guidelines, careful strategic planning, and transparent policies within health care organizations. IoT-based health care has great potential to improve the efficiency of the health system and improve population health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - While mobile-based behavioral weight loss apps are increasing, little is known about factors associated with likelihood of viewing in-app messages. The objectives of this study were to examine, among 52 young adults participating in a microrandomized trial testing smartphone-delivered messages promoting weight management behaviors, the proportion of intervention messages viewed and behavioral predictors of message viewing. Two thirds of messages delivered were viewed. Messages were less likely to be viewed over time in the program and as participants' total weight change in the program increased. Lapses in self-weighing and increased weight since the last weighing observation were associated with decreased probability of message viewing. Conversely, increased days of meeting dietary goals in the last 7 days were associated with increased likelihood that a message was viewed. These findings identified circumstances in which messages are less likely to be viewed and have implications for designing mobile approaches to enhance participant engagement.

N2  - Reports an error in "Increasing cardiovascular medication adherence: A Medical Research Council complex mHealth intervention mixed-methods feasibility study to inform global practice" by Sahar Khonsari, Colin Chandler, Richard Parker and Aisha Holloway (Journal of Advanced Nursing, 2020[Oct], Vol 76[10], 2670-2684). In the original article, there were errors in relation to the use of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8), Persian for Iran translation. Missing text regarding the scale is provided for Tables 3 and 4 and in Acknowledgements. Three additional references and four additional references that should be cited in the text under the headings 'Survey instruments' and 'Data analysis' respectively are also provided. Finally, for the reference list, three additional references are provided that are required for the 8-item MMAS. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-71227-024). Aims: To evaluate a mHealth intervention to increase medication adherence among Iranian coronary heart disease patients. Design: Quantitative-dominant mixed-methods study. Data Source: Iranian coronary heart disease patients' responses and most recent clinical documents as well as responses from Iranian cardiac nurses who participated in this study. Methods: The study was conducted between September 2015-April 2016 drawing on the Medical Research Council's Framework. Phase one comprised of a patients' survey and focus groups with cardiac nurses. The automated short message service reminder was piloted in phase two. We recruited 78 patients and randomized to receive either 12-week daily reminders or usual care. The primary outcome was the effect on medication adherence; secondary outcomes were self-efficacy, ejection fraction, functional capacity, readmission rate and quality of life. Results: Feasibility was evidenced by high ownership of mobile phones and high interest in receiving reminders. Participants in the intervention group showed significantly higher medication adherence compared with the control group. Conclusion: The mHealth intervention was well accepted and feasible with early evidence of effectiveness that needs to be confirmed in a fully powered future randomized clinical trial.

N2  - Objective: Body image disturbance (BID) is common among women, characterized by persistent and distressing appearance dissatisfaction, and linked with eating disorders. Although effective, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered by trained professionals is not easily accessible. This randomized trial evaluated the effects of a CBT-based mobile application designed to increase resilience to body image triggers and reduce BID symptoms. Method: A non-clinical sample of women (N = 90; Mage = 23.52) was randomized to use the mobile application for approximately 4 min of daily exercises for two weeks or to a control condition. Body image was measured at baseline, immediately after two weeks of mobile application use, and at 1-month follow-up. To examine whether using the application was associated with increased resilience to common BID triggers, participants completed an Instagram exposure resilience task upon completion and at 1-month follow-up. Results: Relative to those in the control condition, participants who used the application demonstrated increased resiliency and reduced BID symptoms. Theses effects were medium-to-large and were maintained at 1-month follow-up. Conclusion: These results underscore the potential usefulness of brief, low-intensity, portable interventions in reducing BID symptoms and in increasing resilience to thin-ideal body messages often portrayed on social media.

N2  - Background: Although gamification continues to be a popular approach to increase engagement, motivation, and adherence to behavioral interventions, empirical studies have rarely focused on this topic. There is a need to empirically evaluate gamification models to increase the understanding of how to integrate gamification into interventions. Objective: The model of gamification principles for digital health interventions proposes a set of five independent yet interrelated gamification principles. This study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of this model to inform its use in Web- and mobile-based apps. Methods: A total of 17 digital health interventions were selected from a curated website of mobile- and Web-based apps (PsyberGuide), which makes independent and unbiased ratings on various metrics. A total of 133 independent raters trained in gamification evaluation techniques were instructed to evaluate the apps and rate the degree to which gamification principles are present. Multiple ratings (n>=20) were collected for each of the five gamification principles within each app. Existing measures, including the PsyberGuide credibility score, mobile app rating scale (MARS), and the app store rating of each app were collected, and their relationship with the gamification principle scores was investigated. Results: Apps varied widely in the degree of gamification implemented (ie, the mean gamification rating ranged from 0.17 <= m <= 4.65 out of 5). Inter-rater reliability of gamification scores for each app was acceptable (kappa >= 0.5). There was no significant correlation between any of the five gamification principles and the PsyberGuide credibility score (P >= .49 in all cases). Three gamification principles (supporting player archetypes, feedback, and visibility) were significantly correlated with the MARS score, whereas three principles (meaningful purpose, meaningful choice, and supporting player archetypes) were significantly correlated with the app store rating. One gamification principle was statistically significant with both the MARS and the app store rating (supporting player archetypes). Conclusions: Overall, the results support the validity and potential utility of the model of gamification principles for digital health interventions. As expected, there was some overlap between several gamification principles and existing app measures (eg, MARS). However, the results indicate that the gamification principles are not redundant with existing measures and highlight the potential utility of a 5-factor gamification model structure in digital behavioral health interventions. These gamification principles may be used to improve user experience and enhance engagement with digital health programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Smoking during pregnancy is a well-known risk factor for both the mother and the baby. mHealth offers novel ways to implement smoking-cessation interventions with broader reach and the potential to be more successful. Methods: We conducted twelve semi-structured interviews in November-December 2017 with women who just gave birth and quit smoking before or during pregnancy. A thematic analysis was conducted to explore women's views on the two components. Results: Most women found the text messages easy to understand and virtually all women rated their content as relevant for preventing smoking relapse. Also, they expressed interest in using the proposed relapse prevention app and, in general, appreciated the app positively. Some women, however, felt that the smoking relapse decision is highly personal and cannot be influenced by text messages or other types of assistance programs. Conclusions: Stay Quit Together is, to our knowledge, the first postpartum tobacco smoking relapse prevention program combining an app and text messages. This study suggests that Stay Quit Together would be accepted and used postpartum by women who spontaneously quit smoking during or before pregnancy.

N2  - Evidence-based interventions for individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) depend on sustained engagement, but individuals with SMI often disengage from treatment prematurely. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may alleviate barriers that are associated with in-person services. In the present study we evaluate whether demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with SMI (n = 163) are differentially associated with their engagement when randomized to mHealth vs. clinic-based care. With regard to diagnosis and demographics, participants randomized to mHealth engaged for more weeks across predictors; however, exploratory subgroup analyses suggested differences in engagement were highest among individuals with bipolar disorder (d = .97) and those who had previously used a smartphone (d = .72). With regard to symptom severity, differences in engagement between conditions were greatest amongst individuals with elevated depressive (d = .99) and psychotic (d = 1.01) symptoms as well as lower self-reported recovery (d = .85). Differences in engagement between mHealth and in-person care amongst those with highest self-rated recovery and lowest depressive and psychotic symptoms were small and non-significant. These findings suggest that mHealth may have an especially large advantage in maintaining engagement amongst individuals with the most severe clinical presentations. This suggests mHealth could provide added value in keeping individuals at elevated risk of poor outcomes connected to care. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Worry is an important mediator in the relation between stressors and health. This pilot study examined whether a smartphone-based in time worry-reduction training was feasible and improved physiological health (i.e. increased heart rate variability [HRV]). A total of 26 high-worriers were randomised to an experimental or active-control condition (EC and CC respectively). Participants in both conditions registered emotions 5 times daily for a month. The EC additionally received worry-reduction training with mindfulness exercises. Primary outcomes were feasibility and HRV measured at baseline, after 2 weeks (halfway), and at 4 weeks (post-intervention). Both training conditions were feasible and well received. HRV increased in the EC and CC, but this increase did not differ between conditions. Preliminary findings suggest that both training conditions are feasible and might improve HRV, which is an important predictor of cardiovascular disease. This pilot study only provided preliminary evidence, but it laid the groundwork for future randomised controlled trials that ought to include more participants and a waitlist control group in order to get more definitive evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention.

N2  - Objective The current multicentre randomized controlled trial assessed the clinical efficacy of a combined mHealth intervention for eating disorders (EDs) based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Method A total of 106 ED patients from eight different public and private mental health services in Spain were randomly assigned to two parallel groups. Patients of the experimental group (N = 53) received standard face-to-face CBT plus a mobile intervention through an application called "TCApp," which provides self-monitoring and an online chat with the therapist. The control group (N = 53) received standard face-to-face CBT only. Patients completed self-report questionnaires on ED symptomatology, anxiety, depression, and quality of life, before and after treatment. Results Significant reductions in primary and secondary outcomes were observed for participants of both groups, with no differences between groups. Results also suggested that the frequency with which patients attended their referral mental health institution after the intervention was lower for patients in the experimental group than for those in the control group. Discussion The current study showed that CBT can help to reduce symptoms relating to ED, regardless of whether its delivery includes online components in addition to traditional face-to-face treatment. Besides, the additional component offered by the TCApp does not appear to be promising from a purely therapeutic perspective but perhaps as a cost-effective tool, reducing thus the costs and time burden associated with weekly visits to health professionals.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Despite a recent plateau in the trend, childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity rates remain high in the United States. Furthermore, insufficient physical activity participation and poor dietary habits are common in girls throughout adolescence. Adolescent girls are disproportionately at risk for poor health behaviors and unhealthy weight gain as compared to their male counterparts. Research indicates that summer presents a heightened behavioral risk for girls, as poor dietary habits and physical inactivity increase in these months. A strategy to mitigate this seasonal risk may be to engage girls in summer camps which target healthy nutrition and exercise outcomes, albeit positive lifestyle changes associated with similar behavioral programs have been short-term in nature. Indeed, the behavioral intervention literature is fraught with mixed findings regarding long-term positive results, perhaps due to two factors: 1) previous studies targeting youth have not directly intervened upon identity, an important psychological mechanism which meaningfully influences longitudinal behavior, or 2) intervention designs did not consider the need for family-oriented programming to habituate healthy behaviors in the home environment. An individual strives to remain in behavioral congruence with their chosen identity standards. Thus, physical activity may be influenced by one's exercise identity and dietary behaviors may be impacted a salient healthy eater identity. Notably, identity is best developed during the adolescent years and trends as stable across the lifespan. Therefore, the development of a girl's exercise and healthy eater identity through participation in a family-oriented intervention is of interest. However, identity-focused and family-oriented interventions should initially be offered in the summer months as part of a multicomponent framework, to best address behavioral risks which are exacerbated during this time frame. This dissertation investigated the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention, comprised of a 1-week behavioral camp and a 10-week family-oriented eHealth program, on a variety of health outcomes in pre-adolescent girls when results from the intervention group were compared to a control group. All study participants attended an identity-focused, behavioral swimming and healthy lifestyle camp for one week in the summer, prior to randomization to either access eHealth (intervention group) or to a usual care comparison (control group). Both the camp and eHealth program aimed to develop girls' exercise identity and healthy eater identity, and subsequently enhance healthy behaviors. It was hypothesized that the camp-plus-eHealth condition (i.e., intervention) would report improved exercise identity, healthy eater identity, and physical activity and dietary behaviors as compared to the camp-only condition (i.e., control) due to the extended availability of intervention materials in the home environment via the eHealth program.This dissertation includes three study manuscripts, entitled as Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Chapter 4 describes the importance of key community stakeholders in the intervention design phase, and additionally offers lessons-learned for future intervention design teams. Chapter 5 provides findings from between- and within-group analytic comparisons of the intervention and control groups and addresses the study's specific aims, attached hypotheses, and a question of interest concerning participants' compliance with physical activity guidelines at baseline, post-camp, and follow-up measures. Additional questions of interest were posed, such as: 1) which psychological factor (i.e., exercise identity or healthy eater identity) would be most associated with follow-up physical activity and dietary behaviors, and 2) would eHealth compliance be associated with study outcomes? In-depth answers to these... (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This randomized, controlled trial experimental study aimed at comparing the effect of cognitive behavioral counseling between online (Internet-based) and more traditional face-to-face counseling methods. The study is based on 90 students of second-grade level, in junior high schools in Buleleng Regency, Bali, Indonesia, who were invited to be participants of this study. Each participant was assigned randomly into three groups with different conditions; 30 students followed a traditional eight, 55-minute cognitive behavioral group counseling track (face to face counseling); 30 students followed Internet-based cognitive behavioral counseling; and 30 students were in a "waiting-list" control category. The data was gathered by using the 14 items Indonesian version of the psychological subscale, Resilience Youth Development Module, Junior High School. The data was then analyzed using the Repeated Measures ANOVA. The results of this study show that: (1) the students' resilience in attending both counseling groups was significantly increasing from pretest to posttest, and included evaluation in follow up testing; (2) after all counseling sessions, and five weeks after counseling the students in both groups, data indicates a higher resilience than the waiting-list control group; and (3) there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioral counseling and face-to-face. The result of this study is discussed in the framework of the online method of counseling, to promote the students' mental health and resilience.

N2  - People living in areas of intractable conflicts experience extreme negative emotions which ultimately lead to support of aggressive policies. Emotion regulation and particularly cognitive reappraisal has been found to be effective in reducing negative emotional experiences and shifting policy preferences. Therefore, it is important to develop scalable, evidence-based interventions aimed at regulating negative emotions in such contexts. In this paper, we introduce ReApp-a mobile game, aimed at training people to regulate their emotions using cognitive reappraisal. We examine the game's effectiveness in reducing negative emotions and support for aggressive policies in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Results indicate that people who played ReApp experienced lower levels of anger and disgust, and were less supportive of aggressive political policies targeted at the outgroup. We believe that games such as ReApp could potentially influence mass audiences and by that promote conflict resolution. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Despite compelling evidence that fruit and vegetable (F/V) consumption can reduce the risk of obesity and chronic disease, most children fail to meet the daily recommendations for dietary consumption. Theoretical models and empirical findings suggest that parents play a key role in guiding children's overall dietary behaviors. To extend previous findings, the current study utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) on smartphones to assess the within-subject and between-subject effects of maternal support (i.e., encouragement, preparation) of F/V on their child's F/V consumption. Mother-child dyads (n = 191) completed six semi-annual 7-day waves of EMA surveys. EMA assessed mothers' past 2-h support for F/V and children's F/V consumption. At the within-subject level, greater maternal encouragement for F/Vs (OR = 2.41) and maternal preparation of F/Vs (OR = 1.43) than usual were associated with increased odds of their child eating F/V during the same 2-h window. At the between-subject level, greater maternal preparation of F/V (OR = 5.99), compared to other mothers, was associated with increased odds of their child eating F/V. Children with lower BMI (vs. higher BMI) were more likely to consume F/Vs when their mothers encouraged them to eat F/V (OR = 0.74). These findings suggest that maternal support may have a strong and immediate effect on children's F/V consumption. Theoretical models on behavior change should consider how explanatory factors, such as parental support, may vary at the momentary level. Boosting maternal support at the momentary level may be a critical component of future mobile-based interventions to address childhood obesity.

N2  - Sexual difficulties are common, but there is limited access to specialist services. People concerned about their sexual functioning may not seek help, and patients and health professionals can find it difficult to raise the topic. This intervention description paper details the aims, design and therapeutic rationale underpinning an interactive website which provides stand-alone, tailored advice and self-help for sexual difficulties. Sextherapylondon (STL) is an interactive digital intervention (IDI) offering evidence-based sex therapy including psychoeducation, cognitive-behavioural and systemic therapy techniques within a social constructionist framework. An online triage module identifies those who need clinical assessment before proceeding with online sex therapy, generating a referral letter. STL offers online self-help for getting or keeping erections, early ejaculation, sexual pain, difficulties with orgasm, and lack or loss of sexual desire. In this paper we describe the content and design of the STL web-based sex therapy programs, including the theoretical and therapeutic rationale which underpins the website structure and content. Sextherapylondon replicates key aspects of therapist-delivered sex therapy from a range of theoretical approaches, to provide tailored, personalised feedback. By offering private, convenient online access, interactive digital interventions can address the needs of people with sexual difficulties who may not otherwise receive help.

N2  - Background: E-mental health is an established mode of delivering treatment for common mental disorders in many high income countries. However, evidence of its effectiveness in lower income countries is lacking. This mixed methods study presents lessons learned and preliminary data on the feasibility of a minimally guided e-mental health intervention in Lebanon. The aim was to pilot test Step-by-Step, a WHO guided e-mental health intervention, and research methods prior to future, controlled testing. Methods: Participants were recruited using social media and advertisements in primary care clinics. Participants completed baseline and post-intervention questionnaires on depression symptoms (primary outcome, PHQ-8), anxiety symptoms, well-being, disability and self-perceived problem severity, and a client satisfaction questionnaire. In addition, seven completers, four drop-outs, 11 study staff, and four clinic managers were interviewed with responses thematically analyzed. Website analytics were used to understand participant behavior when using the website. Results: A total of 129 participants signed up via the Step-by-Step website. Seventy-four participants started session 1 after completing pre-test questionnaires and 26 completed both baseline and post-intervention data. Among those who completed post-assessments, depression symptoms improved (PHQ-8 scores (t = 5.62, p < 0.001 two-tailed, df = 25). Wilcoxon signed ranks tests showed a significant difference between baseline and post-Step-by-Step scores on all secondary outcome measures. Client satisfaction data was positive. Interview responses suggested that the intervention could be made more appropriate for younger, single people, more motivating, and easier to use. Those who utilized the support element of the intervention were happy with their relationship with the non-specialist support person (e-helper), though some participants would have preferred specialist support. E-helpers would have liked more training on complex cases. Website analytics showed that many users dropped out before intervention start, and that some re-entered screening data having been excluded from the study. Conclusion: Step-by-Step skills and techniques, model of service integration, and its non-specialist support element are acceptable. Though the sample was small and non-controlled and drop-out was high, results suggest that it may be effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and increasing well-being. Lessons learned will inform content revision, the development of an app version of Step-by-Step, and the research methodology of upcoming effectiveness studies.

N2  - Background: "Cuida tu Animo" (CTA [Take Care of Your Mood]) is an internet-based program for prevention and early intervention of adolescent depression implemented in Chile and Colombia. In the pilot application of the program, participants interacted with the program through a website that provided psychoeducational information, chat, and telephone appointments as well as monitoring and feedback messages. To date, most similar programs were not developed taking design features into consideration. The persuasive systems design (PSD) model is a comprehensive framework developed to aid in the design and evaluation of systems capable of influencing users' attitudes or behaviors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the persuasiveness of CTA pilot program using the PSD model. Methods: The methodology used was expert evaluation, where specialists evaluate the program against a list of design principles. Results: Although the PSD model was not used to design the program, system features proposed by PSD were present, mainly "Dialogue support" features. Persuasion context analysis was not carried out by the developers. No aspects of the program could be related to "Primary task support" features because the developers did not define a primary task. Discussion: Key aspects of the PSD model could be incorporated in the CTA program to enhance system persuasiveness and improve adherence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Examination of nutrition monitoring through ecological momentary assessment during an internet-based, self-directed weight loss intervention.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Internet and mobile health (mHealth) based interventions are promising potential options for increasing access to weight loss treatment for the general public (Payne et al., 2015). Many health-related internet and mobile phone applications are commercially available, free, and include features for nutrition self-monitoring which is a vitally important self-management strategy for weight loss. However, adherence to nutrition self-monitoring for internet and mHealth interventions is poor and research examining the mechanisms of nutrition self-monitoring behavior is limited (Lieffers & Hanning, 2012). The purpose of the present study is to improve understanding of self-monitoring behavior by examining the phenomenological experience of mobile application self-monitoring through ecological momentary assessment (EMA) during the first two weeks of an internet-based, self-directed weight loss intervention. Fifty-one participants (19.6% male, 43.1% non-white) were enrolled in a 16-week, self-directed, online weight loss intervention. Original methods included the use of two different nutrition monitoring applications; however, due to a technological failure only one application (MyFitnessPal) was utilized. Participants completed ecological momentary assessments of nutrition self-monitoring experiences during the first two weeks of the intervention and continued to use online materials and the nutrition monitoring mobile application for the remaining 14 weeks. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was utilized to examine within-subject differences in perceptions and experiences between instances of completed nutrition monitoring and instances of missed nutrition monitoring. The relationships between aggregated participant experiences during the EMA period and nutrition self-monitoring over 16 weeks as well as weight outcomes were examined using correlational analyses. Compliance for EMA event-continent responding and signaled random prompt responding was 58% and 70%, respectively. EMA responses immediately following a nutrition monitoring entry demonstrated increased participant perceptions of goal consistency, diet success, diet maintenance, less emotional eating, less monitoring burden, and greater negative affect as compared to random prompt responses related to a missed nutrition monitoring entry. Participants monitored nutrition for an average of 48.7 days and nutrition monitoring frequency was associated with EMA compliance as well as participant perceptions of goal consistency, diet success, and diet maintenance during the first 14 days. Frequency of nutrition monitoring and perceptions of diet success during EMA were associated with weight change in both completer-only analyses and intent-to-treat. The results of this study suggest that early nutrition monitoring experiences such as the perception of goal consistency and diet success are important factors for engagement in weight loss treatment. However, further research on monitoring experiences with larger and more diverse samples is needed to determine how these factors might be used to inform future assessment and intervention.

N2  - National and international governments have recognized the importance of widespread, timely, and effective health communication, as research shows that accurate, patient-centered, and culturally competent health communication can improve patient and community health-care outcomes. This interdisciplinary series examines the role of health communication in society and is receptive to manuscripts and edited volumes that use a variety of theoretical, methodological, interdisciplinary, and intersectional approaches. This book discusses how the information age has revolutionized nearly every facet of human communication-from the ways in which people purchase products to how they meet and fall in love. These exciting new communication technologies can both unite and divide us. People who are separated by great distances can now communicate with each other in real time, whereas parents often find themselves competing with smartphones and tablets for their children's attention. The book explores the many ways that digital communication media, such as online forums, social networking sites, and mobile applications, enhance and constrain social support in health-related contexts. The goal of this book is to educate readers about what is known about social support and health in the modern era of information. It contains chapters from some of the foremost experts in this fascinating and relevant area. The contributors draw upon communication theory within these areas, and, in some cases, they present new study findings regarding social support processes and health outcomes. Section I focuses on how people communicate social support with others in their own personal networks via social network sites. Section II contains four chapters about the communication of social support in online forums dedicated to a specific health issue. Section III takes a step back to consider some themes and research areas that cut across many contexts of online support. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Imagining one's own future (episodic future thinking, EFT) has helped mothers with overweight purchase healthier groceries during an online shopping task in the laboratory. The present study explored whether delivering an EFT intervention to participants' devices via an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) tool would help mothers purchase healthier food at brick-and-mortar stores. Method: Participants (N = 43, mothers 31-52 years of age, BMI >= 24.9 kg/m2) were randomized to EFT or standardized episodic thinking (SET). EFT cues include a positive and vivid description of future events while SET cues focus on the recent experience of playing games in the laboratory. Cues were uploaded to participant profiles on an EMI site. Participants were trained on how to read and listen to cues as well as how to detail purchases. Participants received text reminders to listen to cues before shopping and returned with receipts the following day. Receipt data was analyzed to derive dependent variables, calories, and nutrients purchased per person. Correlations were used to analyze associations between study variables of interest, and ANOVAs were conducted to compare dietary variables by group. Results: Participants in the EFT group purchased fewer calories, fewer grams of fat, fewer grams of saturated fat, and fewer miligrams of sodium than participants in the SET control group. Conclusion: Delivering EFT cues to participant devices may be a promising way to improve the calorie and nutrient content of food purchases. Future research should include a longer follow-up and analyze calorie changes over time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is the state-of-the-art methodology to capture an individual's experiences (e.g., feelings, thoughts, behaviors) in daily life in an ecologically valid way. In this chapter, we outline the prominent role of EMA within a broader mobile sensing framework connecting domains of data acquisition from a range of sensing sources. We particularly highlight the advantages of context-aware assessment strategies that link the assessment of experiences to specific sensing events or patterns. Finally, we discuss strategies that go beyond assessment to implement innovative Ecological Momentary Interventions in real-life. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this study is to describe the initial stages of the iterative and user-centered mobile mental health adaptation process of Step-by-Step (SbS), a modularized and originally web-based e-mental health intervention developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Given the great need for improving the responsiveness and accessibility of health systems in host countries, the EU-funded STRENGTHS consortium studies the adaptation, implementation and scaling-up of SbS for Syrian refugees in Germany, Sweden and Egypt. Using early prototyping, usability testing and identification of barriers to implementation, the study demonstrates a user-centered process of contextual adaptation to the needs and expectations of Syrian refugees. Materials and Methods: N = 128 adult Syrian refugees residing in Germany, Sweden and Egypt took part in qualitative assessments. Access, usage, and potential barriers regarding information and communication technologies (ICTs) were assessed in free list interviews. Interactive prototypes of the app were presented in key informant interviews and evaluated on usability, user experience and dissemination strategies. Focus groups were conducted to verify the results. The interview protocols were analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. Results: The use of digital technologies was found to be widespread among Syrian refugees. Technical literacy and problems with accessing the internet were common barriers. The majority of the respondents reacted positively to the presented app prototypes, stressing the potential health impact of the intervention (n = 28; 78%), its flexibility and customizability (n = 19; 53%) as well as the easy learnability of the app (n = 12; 33%). Aesthetic components (n = 12; 33%) and the overall length and pace of the intervention sessions (n = 9; 25%) were criticized in regard to their negative impact on user motivation. Acceptability, credibility, and technical requirements were identified as main barriers to implementation. Discussion: The study provided valuable guidance for adapting the app version of SbS and for mobile mental health adaptation in general. The findings underline the value of contextual adaptation with a focus on usability, user experience, and context specific dissemination strategies. Related factors such as access, acceptability and adherence have major implications for scaling-up digital interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Despite theoretical arguments that brief app-based interventions could be a useful adjunct to longer traditional treatment programs, there has been limited evaluation of the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of these micro-interventions. In the present study, 247 women from the general population were randomly assigned to the intervention or wait-list control condition, and provided measurement of body satisfaction and related constructs (body image importance, confidence dealing with body image issues, eating pathology, and self-esteem) at baseline and 21-days (post-intervention). During the 21-day period, the treatment group received access to an eHealth platform containing a series of brief video activities (e.g., gratitude tasks, breathing, and relaxation) previously demonstrated in experimental studies to improve body satisfaction. Findings showed greater improvements in body satisfaction at post-intervention for the intervention group than the waitlist controls (Cohen's d = .42). Use of the intervention content was associated with immediate increases in state-like body satisfaction ratings, and the magnitude of these in-the-moment improvements was predictive of greater post-intervention symptom improvement and retention (ps < .05). However, the intervention did not produce change in constructs related to body satisfaction (Cohen's d ranged from 0.02 to 0.13). Overall, findings offer support for micro-interventions as a spot treatment for specific symptoms, and possible means to maintain engagement and motivation within a broader treatment program.

N2  - A large number of innovative applications of digital technology are now permeating the world of healthcare with the goals of improving health, extending the reach of health care, and reducing the cost of providing care. Over the last 25 years, scientists in the field of addiction science have studied how to enhance outcomes, how to improve the dissemination and implementation of efficacious treatments, and how to reach a greater proportion of the population experiencing substance use disorders (SUDs). The healthcare field has integrated advances in digital technology at an escalating pace to improve health behavior, healthcare delivery, and cost-effectiveness. This new area of science is often referred to as "digital health" and includes advancements in the ways mobile communications and sensing devices, software development, cloud computing, and data analytics enhance the patient experience. This chapter illustrates the ways in which principles and practices from this exciting new field are being tested and applied to enhance treatment for SUD. It explores several issues that need to be addressed to maximize the opportunities offered by digital health, some of which are similar to the barriers that have impeded dissemination and implementation of evidence-based, novel interventions for behavioral health care throughout the years.

N2  - Background: There has been a continuous increase of smart device use among people with physical disabilities in Korea. In spite of previous research on those people's motives to adopt smart devices, little investigation has been conducted to scrutinize post-adoption behaviors of using smart devices among people with physical disabilities. Objective/Hypothesis: Based on the post-adoption model, this study examined the relationship between post-adoption beliefs regarding smart devices and behavioral intentions toward continued use of smartphones among people with physical disabilities. Moreover, this study investigated the moderating effects of self-efficacy on the relationships among the main study variables. Methods: Both online and paper-pencil surveys were conducted, resulting in a total of 108 questionnaires collected from people with physical disabilities. Results: A path analysis showed that, with the exception of perceived ease of use, all variables (confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction of smart device use) had significant effects on continuance intention to use smart devices. Another main finding of this study was the significant moderating effects of general self-efficacy on the relationships among the three variables of confirmation, perceived usefulness, and continuance intention of smart devices. The relationships among the three variables were significantly stronger among people with lower levels of general self-efficacy. Conclusions: This study's main findings will aid the thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that lead people with physical disabilities to continue to use smart devices.

N2  - Technological renaissance of the last century stimulated the application of digital interventions in the healthcare domain. Digital healthcare interventions (DHIs) could be implemented through smartphone applications (apps), remote monitoring and tracking devices, and wearable computers. Technology is positioned to transform how mental healthcare is delivered and accessed. In fact, remote active and passive monitoring of parameters, such as mood, activity, and sleep, could be integrated with therapeutic interventions. However, the transformation entails combined conscription of science, regulation, and design. Implementation, adoption, and evaluation of DHI present special challenges. This chapter presents brief history of DHIs in mental health and frameworks an evaluation strategy in terms of the appropriate methods required for appraisal of DHIs.

N2  - Technology-based self-help treatment programs for OCD have the potential to offer low to no cost treatment to those who may not have access to OCD treatment providers, to compliment on-going therapy and to assist individuals in maintaining treatment gains. To date, the quality of these programs is largely unassessed. This review examines the currently available technology-based self-help treatment programs for OCD. Search results from Google.com, the Apple App Store, and the Google Play Store were reviewed, with 15 programs included in the final review. Research support for the programs was generally nonexistent or very limited. Seven of the programs were deemed empirically-based, despite little to no research support, due to incorporating quality psychoeducation and exposure and response prevention (ERP) elements. The unique strengths of each of these programs are reviewed. The eight non-empirically-based programs varied in quality and function, but many included potentially useful components. Directions and considerations for future tech-based treatment programs are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Leila is an 86-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. She lives alone, and, as a result of a recent heart attack, her family doctor and cardiologist want to see her more frequently. She has some moderate arthritis involving her knees and hips and poor vision, but she is committed to maintaining her independence. There is promise for digital health technologies to improve communication, collaboration, and the use of evidence-based guidelines to circumvent barriers to healthy, independent ageing. Today, age remains one of the greatest obstacles to technology adoption. Visual impairment and limitations in dexterity contribute to this, but another hurdle for many older adults is a lack of confidence in using digital health technologies. Intuitive voice-user interfaces on smart phones can help overcome these usability fears. Built around various consumer voice-recognition technologies, developers are creating voice-based applications for management of chronic conditions, care coordination, medication adherence, and even companionship. Beyond aiding in management, early research shows that voice interfaces could have the potential to serve a diagnostic role by recognizing vocal biomarkers of change in neurological or mental health status.

N2  - The chapters in this book confirm that, with mobile learning, context is crucial, content is core and collaboration can be a key driver of knowledge sharing and building. With mobile devices, learning occurs during informal and formal environments where interpersonal communication is encouraged. Traditional educational settings often have a mono-directional channel from teacher to learner, which can be reduced by incorporating mobile devices as well as m-learning principles and practices. Or with diverse perspectives be increased, through multi-directional facilitation via mobile engagement. Additionally, various dual-oriented learning processes can be leveraged as the mobile user switches between applications to interact with peers, conduct research, and complete work or recreational tasks. Mobile devices create constant connectedness, stimulating engagement with content, context and people. As mobile technology has become even more ubiquitous and a part of a socio-cultural fabric, the usage of mobile devices offers more educational opportunities and opens a broader world for all mobile device users to explore. Mobile learning is applicable across fields, including media, orphanages, museums, mass transit, mobile health, well-being, mathematics, language learning, mobile commerce, accessibility for special needs, senior citizens, cooking and nutrition, and assessments in a multitude of fields. The scope of this book goes beyond K-12, after-school programs, non-profit organizations, workforce development programs, as well as formal and informal organizations; the handbook's audience extends from business corporations to community organizations, including museums and universities. This book on Advancing Mobile Learning in Contemporary Educational Spaces presents a wealth of valuable information for trainers, workers and learners in a wide array of contexts, as it offers a variety of examples of how mobile learning could be introduced, leveraged, researched and/or customized. The chapters offer recommendations for improving ease of use, creating customizable learning resources, identifying learning analytics that offer valuable insight and information on learning gaps through data that could inform successes or enhancements of educational programs. The book is also targeted at leaders of K-12 educational institutions as well as university instructors, department of education, policy makers, administrators, corporate and non-profits, and workforce development professionals as well as medical and mental health practitioners. Thus, expanding the audience of this handbook to any arena where mobile devices are being used informally or formally to aid training, extend learning and support learning and development in a transformational manner that is naturally integrated into daily life.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Objective: After appraising health threats, personal thoughts and emotions can often influence healthy individuals to engage in protection behaviors. Leventhal's Common-Sense Model (CSM) of Self-Regulation and Cameron's Assessment of Illness Risk Representations (AIRR) have provided frameworks for delineating personal risk beliefs, emotional responses, and protection behaviors. Risk beliefs and worry were utilized to develop, pilot, and trial a CSM-guided health communication promoting accurate colorectal cancer (CRC) risk representations and physical activity (PA). Furthermore, the CSM-guided health intervention was developed to be delivered as an online presentation (eHealth) and mobile phone text messages (mHealth). Methods: Three studies were conducted: (a) mixed-methods approach incorporated Think-Aloud technique and repeated measure, (b) using findings from Study 1, two pilot RCTs determined effectiveness of an intervention and validate measures comprising repeated measures, and (c) a longitudinal RCT tested efficacy. For Study 1, 43 university undergraduates participated. For Study 2, 73 university undergraduates were recruited to participate in a pilot RCT to test feasibility and acceptability of the newly developed CSM-guided health intervention (Be Well program, BW). For Study 3, 40 university undergraduates and 44 participants recruited via social media were randomly assigned to the BW condition or Standard CRC Risk Information condition. Results: After developing an intervention to promote CRC prevention and physical activity, themes emerged: text and images accurately depicting CRC risk influenced engagement, clearly labeled images matching text were favored, realistic images were rated higher over illustrations, and text in plain language was endorsed. In Study 2, the BW program was found to be acceptable and relevant to healthy younger adults. In Study 3, RCT found more accurate risk representations and physical activity levels in the BW condition. BW condition reported more coherence of link between PA and CRC risk immediately after receiving mHealth. BW program had higher quality, instilled more mental images, and elicited thoughts about CRC risk. Conclusions: The development of the CSM-guided health intervention for CRC control is described. The BW program was more efficacious in increasing personal understanding of link between cancer risk and PA and PA effort. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - This book describes the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of contemporary family psychology, including an overview of traditional theories; influential contemporary theories; and complex research designs, statistical modeling, and experience sampling, among other topics. It demonstrates how systems thinking unites family psychology practice, research, and policy. The book explores how systemic principles apply to families in contemporary psychology. The book discusses feminist theories and their application within couple and family psychology. It argues that feminist family therapy is at the cutting edge of psychotherapy, multiculturalism, and social justice. The book provides an accessible introductory primer to the biological methods and its application to family science and practice. It illustrates with examples from research on family interactions and relationship processes. The book also provides an overview of how observational coding systems contribute to the scientific study of human relationships and describes some of the methodological considerations in conducting an observationally-based study. It summarizes key demographic shifts in marriage and intimate relationships over the last few decades, highlights recent research themes on contemporary committed relationships, and discusses the implications of these findings for interventions and policies designed to support healthy relationships. The book examines a number of issues relevant to families with children from birth to age 5 and describes normative developmental phases and transitions during this period. It finally addresses the structures, cultural realities, and roles of military personnel and family members, with a focus on the deployment cycle as a defining element of service in this era of global terrorism.

N2  - Background: Hydroxyurea, chronic blood transfusions, and bone marrow transplantation are efficacious, disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease but involve complex risk-benefit trade-offs and decisional dilemma compounded by the lack of comparative studies. A patient decision aid can inform patients about their treatment options, the associated risks and benefits, help them clarify their values, and allow them to participate in medical decision making. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a literacy-sensitive Web-based patient decision aid based on the Ottawa decision support framework, and through a randomized clinical trial estimate the effectiveness of the patient decision aid in improving patient knowledge and their involvement in decision making. Methods: We conducted population decisional needs assessments in a nationwide sample of patients, caregivers, community advocates, policy makers, and health care providers using qualitative interviews to identify decisional conflict, knowledge and expectations, values, support and resources, decision types, timing, stages and learning, and personal clinical characteristics. Interview transcripts were coded using QSR NVivo 10. Alpha testing of the patient decision aid prototype was done to establish usability and the accuracy of the information it conveyed, and then was followed by iterative cycles of beta testing. We conducted a randomized clinical trial of adults and of caregivers of pediatric patients to evaluate the efficacy of the patient decision aid. Results: In a decisional needs assessment, 223 stakeholders described their preferences, helping to guide the development of the patient decision aid, which then underwent alpha testing by 30 patients and 38 health care providers and iterative cycles of beta testing by 87 stakeholders. In a randomized clinical trial, 120 participants were assigned to either the patient decision aid or standard care (SC) arm. Qualitative interviews revealed high levels of usability, acceptability, and utility of the patient decision aid in education, values clarification, and preparation for decision making. On the acceptability survey, 72% (86/120) of participants rated the patient decision aid as good or excellent. Participants on the patient decision aid arm compared to the SC arm demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in decisional self-efficacy (P = .05) and a reduction in the informed sub-score of decisional conflict (P = .003) at 3 months, with an improvement in preparation for decision making (P < .001) at 6 months. However, there was no improvement in terms of the change in knowledge, the total or other domain scores of decisional conflicts, or decisional self-efficacies at 6 months. The large amount of missing data from survey completion limited our ability to draw conclusions (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - We developed an iOS-based app with a transmitter/disposable sensor and corresponding manualized intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder. The app signaled the onset of urination, time-stamped accidents for analysis, reminded parents to reinforce intervals of continence, provided a visual outlet for parents to communicate reinforcement, and afforded opportunity for timely feedback from clinicians. We compared this intervention with an intervention that uses standard behavioral treatment in a pilot randomized controlled trial of 33 children with autism spectrum disorder aged 3-6 years with urinary incontinence. Parents in both groups received initial training and four booster consultations over 3 months. Results support the feasibility of parent-mediated toilet training studies (e.g., 84% retention rate, 92% fidelity of parent-implemented intervention). Parents used the app and related technology with few difficulties or malfunctions. There were no statistically significant group differences for rate of urine accidents, toilet usage, or satisfaction at close of intervention or 3-month follow-up; however, the alarm group trended toward greater rate of skill acquisition with significantly less day-to-day intervention. Further development of alarm and related technology and future comparative studies with a greater number of participants are warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To develop, evaluate and correlate the acceptability of an educational mobile application to patients submitted to orthognathic surgery. Method: Methodological study based on systematic instructional design with contents aimed at patient learning through a mobile application. Usability and user satisfaction were evaluated by 30 patients in the perioperative stage through an electronic questionnaire sent by social networks, e-mail and business card, measured using the System Usability Scale instrument validated in Portuguese and user satisfaction with an instrument based on another study, after its applications. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and Spearman correlation. Results: The application named "OrtogApp" features content validated in a previous study included five learning content sessions essential for managing perioperative care, and it is available on IOS and Android platforms. Usability corresponded to 79.8 + 15.4 points and the satisfaction index was 82.9%; correlation of age, schooling and uses of the application with the instruments was not significant. Conclusion: OrtogApp is an educational application with content validated by professionals, resulting in high user satisfaction and good usability. Patients may use the application as supportive educational material to supplement guidance provided by perioperative nurses and/ or surgeons during perioperative care.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to present a stepwise, multi-construct, innovative framework that supports the use of eHealth technology to reach sexual minority populations of color to establish trustworthiness and build trust. The salience of eHealth interventions can be leveraged to minimize the existing paradigm of medical mistrust among sexual minority populations of color living with chronic illnesses. These interventions include virtual environments and avatar-led eHealth videos, which address psychosocial and structural-level challenges related to mistrust. Our proposed framework addresses how eHealth interventions enable technology adoption and usage, anonymity, co-presence, self-disclosure, and social support and establish trustworthiness and build trust.

N2  - We implemented an exploratory A-B single case research design with a phenomenological lens to analyze journal entries to assess the effectiveness of a 12-week mindfulness-based mobile intervention to reduce burnout and increase mindfulness and self-compassion. Our participant was one 55-year-old White woman employed as a substance abuse counselor at a medium sized treatment facility in a midwestern state. We collected three weeks of baseline data followed by a 12-week intervention using the Calm © app and collected self-reported scores on the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, and the Self-Compassion Scale across baseline and intervention phases. Data analyses using the Percentage of Data Exceeding the Median provide preliminary evidence that using the Calm © app across 12 weeks may decrease levels of burnout and increase levels of mindfulness but provided no evidence for increased self-compassion. We provide suggestions for substance abuse counselors and discuss the limitations and future research recommendations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Mental health apps have the potential to decrease the burden of disease associated with mental illness. However, few apps have been evaluated for effectiveness. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the strengths-focused My Coping Plan app in improving mental health and coping. Methods: Participants were 56 Australian University students with self-reported elevated levels of distress (K10 total >= 16). Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (My Coping Plan) or waitlist control condition. Results: At 1-month follow-up, participants in the intervention condition reported significantly lower psychological distress (d = 0.31), improved wellbeing (d = -0.42) and improved healthy coping strategies (d = 0.39) compared with the control condition. There was no significant difference between groups in reported unhealthy coping strategies. The majority of participants downloaded the app and made a coping plan. Just over half used their plan when they were distressed. Conclusions: The My Coping Plan app can improve mental health and wellbeing in the short-term, likely through increased self-efficacy. Professional support may be necessary to support long-term use of healthy coping strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Today's smartphones allow for a wide range of "big data" measurement, for example, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), whereby behaviors are repeatedly assessed within a person's natural environment. With this type of data, we can better understand-and predict-risk for behavioral and health issues and opportunities for (self-monitoring) interventions. In this mixed-methods feasibility study, through convenience sampling we collected data from 32 participants (aged 16-24) over a period of three months. To gain more insight into the app experiences of youth with mental health problems, we interviewed a subsample of 10 adolescents who received psycthological treatment. The results from this feasibility study indicate that emojis) can be used to identify positive and negative feelings, and individual pattern analyses of emojis may be useful for clinical purposes. While adolescents receiving mental health care are positive about future applications, these findings also highlight some caveats, such as possible drawback of inaccurate representation and incorrect predictions of emotional states. Therefore, at this stage, the app should always be combined with professional counseling. Results from this small pilot study warrant replication with studies of substantially larger sample size.

N2  - Breast cancer survivors are at risk for poor health, with physical activity a possible treatment. Little research has examined how technology might promote breast cancer survivor physical activity or health. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of employing a commercially available mobile health application- and social media-based health education intervention to improve breast cancer survivor physical activity or health. Ten breast cancer survivors (X age = 45.80 +/- 10.23 years; X weight = 79.51 +/- 20.85 kg) participated in this 10-week single-group pilot study from 2015 to 2016. Participants downloaded the MapMyFitness application, documented all physical activity with MapMyFitness, and were enrolled in a Social Cognitive Theory-based, Facebook-delivered health education intervention. Objectively measured physical activity, weight or body composition, cardiovascular fitness, psychosocial constructs, and quality of life indices were measured at baseline and 10 weeks. Intervention use and acceptability was evaluated during and following the intervention. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all study outcomes, with qualitative analyses performed regarding use and acceptability. At postintervention, average daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and steps increased by 2.6 min and 1,657, respectively, with notable decreases in weight (2.4 kg) and body fat percentage (2.3%). Physical activity-related social support and ability to engage in social roles or activity demonstrated the greatest improvements among all psychosocial and quality of life indices, respectively. Participants enjoyed the feedback and tracking features of MapMyFitness, with most finding the Facebook component helpful. All participants recommended the intervention for future use. Physical activity interventions combining commercially available mobile health applications and theoretically based social media-delivered health interventions may promote certain physiological, psychosocial, and quality of life outcomes among breast cancer survivors. Larger samples and randomized studies are warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: User engagement is key to the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions. Considerable research has examined the clinical outcomes of overall engagement with mental health apps (eg, frequency and duration of app use). However, few studies have examined how specific app use behaviors can drive change in outcomes. Understanding the clinical outcomes of more nuanced app use could inform the design of mental health apps that are more clinically effective to users. Objective: This study aimed to classify user behaviors in a suite of mental health apps and examine how different types of app use are related to depression and anxiety outcomes. We also compare the clinical outcomes of specific types of app use with those of generic app use (ie, intensity and duration of app use) to understand what aspects of app use may drive symptom improvement. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of system use data from an 8-week randomized trial of a suite of 13 mental health apps. We categorized app use behaviors through a mixed methods analysis combining qualitative content analysis and principal component analysis. Regression analyses were used to assess the association between app use and levels of depression and anxiety at the end of treatment. Results: A total of 3 distinct clusters of app use behaviors were identified: learning, goal setting, and self-tracking. Each specific behavior had varied effects on outcomes. Participants who engaged in self-tracking experienced reduced depression symptoms, and those who engaged with learning and goal setting at a moderate level (ie, not too much or not too little) also had an improvement in depression. Notably, the combination of these 3 types of behaviors, what we termed "clinically meaningful use," accounted for roughly the same amount of variance as explained by the overall intensity of app use (ie, total number of app use sessions). This suggests that our categorization of app use behaviors succeeded in capturing app use associated with better outcomes. However, anxiety outcomes were neither associated with specific behaviors nor generic app use. Conclusions: This study presents the first granular examination of user interactions with mental health apps and their effects on mental health outcomes. It has important implications for the design of mobile health interventions that aim to achieve greater user engagement and improved clinical efficacy.

N2  - Psychological distress and negative conditions are highly frequent in patients with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has been shown to be effective in reducing psychological symptoms in patients with chronic diseases. The available evidence has supported the potential benefit of MBSR for PCI patients. However, the traditional group classroom format and long exercise times of MBSR were deemed as barriers to access for these patients. The aim of this study was to examine the short-term effectiveness of a brief, one-on-one, telephone-adapted MBSR on psychological distress of PCI patients. A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy consecutive PCI patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomized to a three-session mindfulness intervention group (N = 35) or a waitlist control group (N = 35). The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and short form of the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI-s) were used to assess anxiety and depression, stress, and mindfulness before and after the intervention. Sixty-two patients completed the study. Compared with the waitlist group, the MBSR group showed greater decreases in HADS (p = .006) and PSS (p = .035) scores. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis also demonstrated that HADS (p = .018) and PSS (p = .037) scores decreased significantly in the MBSR group compared with those in the waitlist group at Week 6. These effects were mediated by an increase in mindfulness. The brief, one-on-one, telephone-adapted mindfulness intervention can improve psychological symptoms in PCI patients.

N2  - Developing a sense of parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction is essential for positive parenting and healthy development of the child. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (T-CBT) on parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. A multi-site randomized controlled trial was conducted between July 2012 and March 2014. A total of 397 Chinese mothers at risk of postnatal depression were recruited through the postnatal units at three regional public hospitals in Hong Kong and were randomized to receive T- CBT (n = 197) or standard care (n = 200). The T-CBT consisted of five weekly 30-min sessions focusing on changing dysfunctional cognitions and developing problem-solving skills. Parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction were measured by the efficacy and satisfaction subscales of the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC-E/S), respectively, at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months postpartum. When compared with standard care, T-CBT was associated with a significant improvement in parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction at 6 weeks postpartum (mean difference in PSOC-E: 2.85 [95% CI: 1.72-3.98], p < .001; mean difference in PSOC-S score: 1.61 [95% CI: 0.52-2.71], p = .004), and 6 months (mean difference in PSOC-E score: 3.37 [95% CI: 1.89-4.85], p < .001; mean difference in PSOC-S score: 2.39 [95% CI: 0.96-3.82], p = .001). T-CBT produced significantly greater improvement in parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction than standard care. The results highlight the potential of T-CBT as a promising treatment modality to facilitate maternal adaptation and promote a sense of parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction during the transition to new motherhood.

N2  - Gamification is a popular method used to add entertaining and appealing dimensions to nongaming activities. Researchers of technology-based behavioral and mental-health-focused interventions have shown considerable interest in gamification to enhance engagement and adherence. There have been a number of gamification frameworks proposed, each with differences in focus but with overlapping similarities. A review of these frameworks highlight critical issues in gamification-lack of clear definitions, standards, and a need for an overarching model for applying gamification, rather than simply describing gamification. These issues leave researchers challenged to apply gamification to its full potential. This paper explores gamification as a construct and endeavors to define its core features. A useful way of evaluating the potential utility of gamification features in the context of an intervention is by distinguishing between exogenous applications of gamification (layering game mechanics externally upon a system) and endogenous application of gamification (developing mechanics intrinsic to the given experience). By then comparing and contrasting six gamification frameworks, components are identified that lay at the intersection and a theoretical model is proposed. A theory-driven set of gamification principles, organized into four categories, is developed and presented. Of particular interest is the utilization of this model as it relates to behavioral and mental-health-focused Internet-based interventions. To demonstrate the potential of this gamification framework, the generated principles are overlaid onto the established Model for Internet Interventions, extending it, and providing a more concrete foundation for researchers of Internet interventions. The presented model will assist researchers and developers who are interested in applying gamification to Internet interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Poor maternal oral health during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and child outcomes, including preterm birth and early childhood caries. Subsequently, professional associations have developed prenatal oral health guidelines, but significant gaps exist in implementing guidelines into clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to develop and test the usability of an innovative, theory-driven, eHealth application ("app") to facilitate prenatal providers' (nurse practitioners and midwives) implementation of oral health promotion during prenatal care visits. App development was guided by previous research, an integrated conceptual framework, Scientific Advisory Board input, and consumer-engaged iterative processes utilizing mixed-methods (observations, surveys, in-depth interviews) among providers (n = 4) during 10 unique prenatal care visits at a federally qualified health care center. Triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data analysis produced descriptive frequencies and salient themes. Concepts and principles from the following theoretical frameworks informed intervention development and testing: Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model; Health Literacy; and Brief Motivational Interviewing. Overall, providers reported the app was effective at providing the information, motivation, and behavioral skills needed to integrate oral health promotion (e.g., easy to use; provided cues to action via scripts and tailored education; and documented findings into the patient's record). Although providers reported high usability, time constraints and detailed patient counseling scripts were identified areas for improvement. Findings suggest that the eHealth app could serve as an innovative mechanism to assist providers in implementing the prenatal oral health guidelines into practice. Future research is needed to continue app development efforts and to determine efficacy and effectiveness in practice settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Despite public health efforts, individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) still have very high rates of tobacco smoking. Innovative approaches to reach this population are needed. These series of case studies aimed to descriptively evaluate the usability, user experience (UX), and user engagement (UE) of Learn to Quit (LTQ), an acceptance and commitment therapy smoking cessation app designed for people with SMI, and to compare it with an app designed for the general population, NCI (National Cancer Institute) QuitGuide (QG). Both apps were combined with nicotine replacement therapy and technical coaching. Inspired by the ORBIT model, we implemented two case studies with crossover AB interventions, two B-phase training designs, and three bi-phasic AB single-case designs with Start-Point and Order randomization (A = QG, B = LTQ). Study outcomes were measured using the System Usability Scale, UX interviews, and background analytics. LTQ's usability levels were above the standard cutoff and on average higher than QG. UX outcomes suggested the relative benefits of LTQ's visual design, gamification and simple design structure. LTQ's overall UE was high; the app was opened for an average of 14 min per day (vs. QG: 7 min). However, users showed low levels of UE with each of the app's tracking feature. Measures of psychiatric functioning suggested the safety of LTQ in people with SMI. LTQ appears to be a usable and engaging smoking cessation app in people with SMI. An optimized version of LTQ should be tested in a Phase II study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health conditions, and they were identified as leading contributors to global disability in 2016. People with these conditions rely on Web-based resources as a source of accurate health information, convenient and effective treatment, and essential social support. However, a recent systematic review revealed several potentially limiting difficulties that this group experiences online and also suggested that there is a partial understanding of these difficulties as only difficulties associated with neurocognitive, but not sociocognitive, deficits were identified. Therefore, this study fills this knowledge gap and contributes to a more robust and fuller understanding of the difficulties this group experiences online. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the difficulties people with depression and anxiety experience when using the Web and the Web activities that are most associated with the experience of difficulties. Methods: The study employed data triangulation using face-to-face semistructured interviews with 21 participants affected by depression and anxiety and a comparison group (7 participants) without mental disorders (study 1) as well as a persona-based expert online survey with 21 mental health practitioners (MHPs) who treated people with depression and anxiety (study 2). Framework analysis for both studies proceeded through 5 stages: (1) familiarization, (2) identifying a thematic framework, (3) indexing, (4) charting, and (5) mapping and interpretation. Results: In study 1, 167 difficulties were identified from the experiences of participants in the depression and anxiety group were discussed within the context of 81 Web activities, services, and features. From these, 4 themes and 12 subthemes describing the difficulties people with depression and anxiety experienced online were identified. Difficulties relating to the subtheme lack of control over access and usage were the most common difficulties experienced by participants in the depression and anxiety group (19/21). Sixteen difficulties identified from the experiences of participants in the comparison group were discussed within the context of 11 Web activities, services, and features. Most participants in the comparison group (6/7) contributed to the subtheme describing difficulties with unexpected and irrelevant content. In study 2, researchers identified 3 themes and 10 subthemes that described the perceived difficulties people with depression and anxiety might experience online as reported by MHPs. Practitioners linked these difficulties with 22 common impairments, limitations in activities of daily life, and diagnostic criteria associated with depression and anxiety. Conclusions: People with depression and anxiety also experience difficulties when using the Web that are related to the sociocognitive deficits associated with their conditions. MHPs have a good awareness of the difficulties that people with depression and anxiety are likely to experience when using the Web. This investigation has contributed to a fuller understanding of these difficulties and provides innovative guidance on how to remove and reduce them for people with depression and anxiety when using the Web.

N2  - The article presents a study on the Preferences of mHealth App Features for Weight Management Among Breast Cancer Survivors From Underserved Populations. Authors examined perceptions of evidenced-based features breast cancer survivors from underserved health disparity-facing populations would find important to include in an mHealth weight management app and to examine the usability of app prototypes. Authors recruited female breast cancer survivors from a large urban safety net hospital. Breast cancer survivors from underserved populations rated most Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs) highly, with techniques related to feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, reducing negative emotions, and instruction/demonstration of behavior being most highly rated. Some techniques, such as social support, commonly included in trials for weight management had wide ranges of perceived importance, bringing down the mean rating in our small sample. This could be because social support features can take many shapes in mHealth interventions, which have varying levels of appeal. Future research should further explore which types of social support are most valued by breast cancer survivors from underserved populations. Open-ended discussion revealed women desire an mHealth app that is technologically simple, has low burden, and is engaging, which have implications for design features. For example, self-monitoring could rely on automatic uploading of data (eg, steps and weight), when possible, or use less burdensome methods of self-monitoring of diet behaviors, such as monitoring food groups (vs entering specific foods). These results share similarities with cancer survivors' preferences for physical activity apps, in which survivors also desired less burdensome tracking methods and advice tailored to cancer experience but perhaps had less emphasis overall on the need for low-burden/technologically simple apps.10 On the basis of the high acceptability rating of the wireframe exemplars, future development, usability testing, and field testing of a complete app package are next research steps. Future quantitative study could examine patterns between participant characteristics and preferences for BCTs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Problem and Purpose: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the second leading cause of death in China. The treatment of CHD typically involves long-term pharmaceutical therapy. For patients with CHD, cardio-protective medications can prevent the enlargement of harmful clots, cardiovascular symptoms, and poor therapeutic outcomes such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. However, in China, poor adherence to cardio-protective medications has been cited as a public health concern. This poor adherence to cardio-protective medications has been linked to increases in healthcare costs due to poor therapeutic outcomes typically requiring major medical interventions, such as coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting. In China, local primary healthcare clinics are often not the first choice for treatment. Instead, patients with serious illnesses such as CHD prefer to utilize hospitals. Consequently, many of the 100 million people diagnosed with CHD in China receive prescriptions and medication-related knowledge in hospitals only without a primary care clinician to monitor their treatment. Under this healthcare utilization model, patients are often not provided with proper treatment maintenance and knowledge regarding their medication-taking behaviors. This lack of follow-up care decreases patients' awareness of the importance of taking medications the way they were prescribed. Mobile health, known as mHealth, is the use of portable electronic devices with software applications to provide healthcare services and manage patient information. China has 1.3 billion mobile phone users, and 97% of Chinese netizens access the Internet by using a mobile phone. These conditions in China are ideal for implementing an mHealth intervention to improve health and practice. The purpose of this study is to develop an mHealth intervention to improve medication adherence among patients with CHD. Methods: First, a pilot study with two phases was conducted in the Cardiology Department of West China Hospital, located in Chengdu, China. Phase I was conducted to inform the development of an mHealth intervention by integrating two mobile applications. The content of reminders and educational materials, the frequency and timing of the intervention were developed in this phase. Based on Phase I, the mHealth intervention was refined and an exploratory randomized controlled trial was conducted in Phase II to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using mHealth as a tool to assist CHD patients to take their cardio-protective medications. The cohorts of participants in the two phases were mutually exclusive. Next, a larger scale study with 196 participants was conducted to assess if the mHealth intervention could improve medication adherence and relevant health outcomes (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate) among patients with CHD in comparison to a control group that receives general educational materials over a period of 60 days. Results: In the larger scale study, we recruited 230 participants and randomized 116 to the experimental group and 114 to the control group. Of the 230 participants, 34 participants did not provide their baseline data, thus they did not receive the allocated intervention; we collected baseline data from 196 participants. Of the 196 participants, six participants dropped out of the study and nine were lost during the follow-up period. Finally, 181 participants completed the study, 97 in the experiemental group, 84 in the control group. The majority of the participants were married (92.4%), male (80.1%), Han Chinese (93.9%), and living in urban China (82.1%). Participants' average age was 61 years old, and half were retired (53.9%). Three out of five participants (61.7%) were prescribed at least five medications. The total medication... (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Substantial numbers of students in Higher Education (HE) are reporting mental health difficulties, such as mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Coupled with academic skills challenges, these difficulties can lead to decreased academic performance, low levels of study satisfaction, and eventually drop out. Student support services are facing budget cuts and can only attend to limited numbers of students, usually the ones who present with more severe mental health problems. Moreover, face-to-face contact may not appeal to those students who feel embarrassed by their problems or are afraid of being stigmatised. To address this important problem, an online psychological wellbeing and study skills support system called MePlusMe, has been developed to provide personalised support to its users. In the present study we investigated the feasibility and acceptability of the contents, design, and functionalities of the system. Methods: An offline version of the system was introduced to 13 postgraduate and undergraduate students (mean age = 31.3 years, SD = 10.25 years; 4 males) in a UK HE Institution, who presented with mild or moderate mental health difficulties. The participants evaluated the design of the system, its functionalities, and contents at Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8. Results: Participants found the system easy to use, professional, and efficient and its contents non-judgemental and informative. Participants stated that engaging with and practicing the techniques targeted at mental health difficulties led to improvements in positive thinking and self-confidence, while the study skills techniques were practical. Suggestions for further improvement included the development of an app and an option for direct engagement with professionals. Conclusions: The findings confirmed the acceptability of the contents, design and functionalities of the system, while providing useful information to inform its further development. Next steps include a feasibility study, which will test and quantify the effects on everyday functioning, mood, mental wellbeing, and academic self-efficacy after using the system, and subsequently a randomized controlled trial, which will evaluate its effectiveness.

N2  - Introduction: Verifying abstinence remotely in trials of digital cessation interventions remains a major challenge. This study reports on using personal carbon monoxide (CO) monitors to assess abstinence in a pragmatic trial of a standalone cessation app involving automated recruitment with no researcher contact. Methods: The study involved secondary data analysis of remote CO testing in a randomized trial (ISRCTN10548241) comparing two versions of a cessation app (BupaQuit). Trial participants were adult UK-based smokers interested in quitting, who were recruited online (02/2015-03/2016). Participants were followed-up through the app, email or phone at 4 weeks. Fifty-nine participants reporting not smoking were posted a personal CO monitor with instructions, and emailed two reminders. The monitors required installing software on a Windows PC. Participants were not reimbursed but retained the device. We recorded the proportion of CO tests returned, test results, self-reported ease of use, correct use, acceptability, and reasons for missing results. Results: Fifteen (25.4%) CO results were returned, of which 86.6% were < 10 ppm and 53.3% were < 5 ppm, indicating abstinence (corresponding to 20.9% and 12.9% of all trial participants self-reporting abstinence, respectively). These 15 participants found the test easy, acceptable and believed they conducted it correctly. Eight (18.2%) of the missing results were accounted for, including no access to a Windows PC, barriers to receiving packages, and unwillingness to share results. Conclusion: Remote validation using personal CO monitors may not yet be feasible in pragmatic studies of cessation apps in which participants are recruited with no reimbursement or direct contact with researchers.

N2  - Background: Digital health products designed to help people with severe mental health problems appear to be feasible, acceptable, and efficacious. The challenge facing the digital mental health field is implementing digital tools in routine service delivery. To date, there has been a paucity of qualitative research exploring staff views of digital health solutions in the context of mental healthcare. Engaging and involving frontline staff in the design and rollout of new technology to improve utilization is imperative for successful uptake and adoption of digital tools. The aim of the current study is to explore frontline staff views regarding the utility and appropriateness of using digital tools in the healthcare pathway for people accessing specialist secondary care mental health services. Method: Qualitative study using framework analysis was used with 48 mental health staff working in early intervention for psychosis services. Six groups comprising 5-10 early intervention service staff members in each group were conducted across the Northwest of England. Robust measures were used to develop a stable framework, including member checking, triangulation, and consensus meetings. Results: Three themes were identified a priori: i) perceived barriers to adopting smartphone apps for early psychosis; ii) acceptability of digital health tools for early psychosis patients; and iii) data security, safety, and risk. Alongside exploring the a priori topics, one theme was generated a posteriori: iv) relationships. Conclusions: Staff working in specialist early intervention for psychosis services found digital tools on the whole acceptable in mental health service provision, but raised a number of concerns that will likely affect implementation of such systems into routine service delivery and practice. Thirteen recommendations are made in this paper as a result of the themes generated in these data. Implementing of digital systems needs to be simple and uncomplicated and improve clinical workflows for staff rather than hinder and increase clinical workflows. Furthermore, organizational support with a clear plan for implementing technological innovations is required for successful adoption of digital systems. Consideration of staff views around digital systems is important if successful adoption and implementation of such systems are to occur. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of mindfulness meditative stress reduction practices and cognitive behavior therapy interventions on perceived stress among a sample of foster parents using app-based intervention delivery. The present study collected data on perceived stress at pre-, post-, and at follow to compare the effects of two app-based stress reduction interventions. A demographic questionnaire was used to assess personal characteristics and the Perceived Stress Scale was used to measure perceived stress. The sample size of this study consisted of 27 foster parents within the state of Arizona. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in perceived stress between the mindfulness group and the cognitive behavior therapy group over time. There was also no statistically significant change in perceived stress scores after participating in either app-based intervention. For all three research questions, we failed to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that neither the mindfulness intervention nor the CBT intervention affected change among this sample of foster parents. The effect size of the interaction effect was small, and the effect size of the between-subjects effect was medium. To the knowledge of this researcher, this is the first study to compare the effects of brief, app-based mindfulness meditative and cognitive behavior therapy stress reduction strategies, and also the first study to do so among a sample of foster parents. Furthermore, this study adds to existing knowledge on perceieved stress among foster parents. It also highlights the need for more research on the relationship between stress, motivation, memory, and foster parents' acceptance and engagement in technology which could provide aid in the development of app-based supports that minimize hindrances, promote growth and mastery, and do so in a convenient, low-cost, and effective manner.

T1  - Sponsor visibility, customization, and user control in the era of interactive technology: Effects on causal attribution of sponsor's motives, sponsor attitudes, and credibility in the context of sponsored mobile health-related apps.

N2  - With the astonishing speed of smartphone and application [app] development, mobile app sponsorship is gaining popularity as a tactic of strategic brand communication and cause-related marketing, especially in the area of health. Smartphone apps provide a high degree of interactivity, which gives users a great deal of control over technology in addition to receiving personalized feedback based on their input. Despite a significant increase of mobile marketing and sponsorship spending, concerns about information privacy are growing in mobile apps. Mobile app sponsorship fosters communities of customers centered on their brand and helps them manage different health issues. It also curates personal customer data and tailors advertising messages and marketing initiatives to reach targeted audiences. However, there is a lack of research explaining how corporate app sponsors are evaluated and what attributions users generate in interactive mobile environments when evaluating the sponsor and the app. Therefore, drawing on the assumptions of attribution theory, this research project examined the effects of three factors in the context of mobile health (mHealth) apps mediated by sponsor motive attributions: visibility (or obtrusiveness) of a sponsor, app personalization pertaining to users' data sharing within a mHealth app interface, and users' control over the information sharing option. The present study employed a mixed factorial online experiment, which manipulated the type of sponsor obtrusiveness (high vs. less vs. no visibility), the scope of customization based on personal information sharing (more vs. less), user control over the information sharing (high vs. low), and message repetition (three times). A total of 252 college students participated in the online experiment via a student research pool and 467 responses were collected from the general population panel sample via the Qualtrics online survey platform to replicate the findings of the online experiment study with the student sample. The results indicated that sponsor visibility in the app interface significantly influenced attitudes towards the sponsor, mHealth app credibility, and intentions to download and use for the mHealth app in both student and general population samples. These effects were mediated by participants' attributions about sponsors' altruistic and self-serving motives. The degrees of personal information sharing and user control were not found to produce negative responses from users. However, higher user control was associated with more positive sponsor attitudes, higher app credibility, and higher download and usage intentions when sponsorship messages were highly visible in the general population panel sample. Also, indirect effects of personal information sharing moderated by user control on sponsor attitudes and app evaluations mediated by altruistic motive attributions were significant in the condition of high app sponsorship visibility. The findings from this study broaden the scope of attribution theory from the perspective of sponsorship in new media, such as mobile health apps. In particular, it emphasizes the importance of cognitive responses using mobile health app sponsorship, especially the important roles of consumer attributions of sponsor motive on attitudes towards the sponsor, mHealth app credibility, and download and usage intentions for the mHealth app. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The practice of regular physical exercise is a protective factor against noncommunicable diseases and premature mortality. In spite of that, large part of the population does not meet physical activity guidelines and many individuals live a sedentary life. Recent technological progresses and the widespread adoption of mobile technology, such as smartphone and wearables, have opened the way to the development of digital behaviour change interventions targeting physical activity promotion. Such interventions would greatly benefit from the inclusion of computational models framed on behaviour change theories and model-based reasoning. However, research on these topics is still at its infancy. The current paper presents a smartphone application and wearable device system called Muoviti! that targets physical activity promotion among adults not meeting the recommended physical activity guidelines. Specifically, we propose a computational model of behaviour change, grounded on the social cognitive theory of self-efficacy. The purpose of the computational model is to dynamically integrate information referring to individuals' self-efficacy beliefs and physical activity behaviour in order to define exercising goals that adapt to individuals' changes over time.The paper presents (i) the theoretical constructs that informed the development of the computational model, (ii) an overview of Muoviti! describing the system dynamics, the graphical user interface, the adopted measures and the intervention design, and (iii) the computational model based on Dynamic Decision Network. We conclude by presenting early results from an experimental study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The current article describes the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Daily Life (ACT-DL) training, a new mobile health treatment protocol for ACT applied in a randomized controlled trial in early psychosis individuals. Between weekly ACT therapy sessions, patients fill out brief questionnaires on an app about their mood, symptoms, activity, and current context, thus promoting awareness-a crucial component of ACT. The app also provides them with visual cues and exercises specifically related to the ACT sessions, to help them implement the techniques previously learned in therapy into their daily lives. Here we assess the feasibility of this protocol in 16 early psychosis individuals, as part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Specifically, we investigate the experienced usefulness of the ACT therapy and app, and burden of the protocol. Results indicate that participants find both the therapy sessions and the app useful, and that ACT-DL guides them in putting ACT into everyday practice, although the protocol may be moderately burdensome. These findings indicate that ACT-DL may help early psychosis patients applying ACT skills to diverse contexts of everyday life. Since ACT is not symptom-specific, ACT-DL may also be suited for different target populations. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

We evaluated a brief, automated risk assessment and intervention platform designed to increase the use of crisis resources provided to those online and in crisis. Method: Participants, users of the digital mental health app Koko, were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions upon accessing the app and were included in the study after their posts were identified by machine learning classifiers as signaling a current mental health crisis. Participants in the treatment condition received a brief Barrier Reduction Intervention (BRI) designed to increase the use of crisis service referrals provided on the app. Participants were followed up several hours later to assess the use of crisis services. Results: Only about one quarter of participants in a crisis (21.8%) reported being "very likely" to use clinical referrals provided to them, with the most commonly endorsed barriers being they "just want to chat" or their "thoughts are too intense." Among participants providing follow-up data (41.3%), receipt of the BRI was associated with a 23% increase in the use of crisis services. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a brief, automated BRI can be efficacious on digital platforms, even among individuals experiencing acute psychological distress. The potential to increase help seeking and service utilization with such procedures holds promise for those in need of psychiatric services. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03633825. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement What is the public health significance of this article?-This study provides evidence that a brief, automated barrier reduction procedure increased the rate of service utilization among individuals in acute distress on digital platforms. These findings suggest that automated procedures may have the potential to increase help-seeking behavior among those in need of mental health services on a large scale.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Background: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is a persuasive system as its design combines therapeutic content, technological features, and interactions between the user and the program to reduce anxiety for children and adolescents. How iCBT is designed and delivered differs across programs. Although iCBT is considered an effective approach for treating child and adolescent anxiety, rates of program use (eg, module completion) are highly variable for reasons that are not clear. As the extent to which users complete a program can impact anxiety outcomes, understanding what iCBT design and delivery features improve program use is critical for optimizing treatment effects. Objective: The objectives of this study were to use a realist synthesis approach to explore the design and delivery features of iCBT for children and adolescents with anxiety as described in the literature and to examine their relationship to program use outcomes. Methods: A search of published and gray literature was conducted up to November 2017. Prespecified inclusion criteria identified research studies, study protocols, and program websites on iCBT for child and adolescent anxiety. Literature was critically appraised for relevance and methodological rigor. The persuasive systems design (PSD) model, a comprehensive framework for designing and evaluating persuasive systems, was used to guide data extraction. iCBT program features were grouped under 4 PSD categories-Primary task support, Dialogue support, System credibility support, and Social support. iCBT design (PSD Mechanisms) and delivery features (Context of use) were linked to program use (Outcomes) using meta-ethnographic methods; these relationships were described as Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations. For our configurations, we identified key PSD features and delivery contexts that generated moderate-to-high program use based on moderate-to-high quality evidence found across multiple iCBT programs. Results: A total of 44 documents detailing 10 iCBT programs were included. Seven iCBT programs had at least one document that scored high for relevance; most studies were of moderate-to-high methodological rigor. We developed 5 configurations that highlighted 8 PSD features (Tailoring, Personalization [Primary task supports]; Rewards, Reminders, Social role [Dialogue supports]; and Trustworthiness, Expertise, Authority [System credibility supports]) associated with moderate-to-high program use. Important features of delivery Context were adjunct support (a face-to-face, Web- or email-based communications component) and whether programs targeted the prevention or treatment of anxiety. Incorporating multiple PSD features may have additive or synergistic effects on program use. Conclusions: The Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations we developed suggest that, when delivered with adjunct support, certain PSD features contribute to moderate-to-high use of iCBT prevention and treatment programs for children and adolescents with anxiety. Standardization of the definition and measurement of program use, formal testing of individual and combined PSD features, and use of real-world design and testing methods are important next steps to improving how we develop and deliver increasingly useful treatments to target users.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Background: Transitioning into parenthood can be stressful for new parents, especially with the lack of continuity of care from health care professionals during the postpartum period. Short hospital stays limit the availability of support and time parents need to be well equipped with parenting and infant care skills. Poor parental adjustment may, in turn, lead to negative parental outcomes and adversely affect the child's development. For the family's future well-being, and to facilitate a smoother transition into parenthood, there is a need for easily accessible, technology-based educational programs to support parents during the crucial perinatal period. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a technology-based supportive educational parenting program (SEPP) on parenting outcomes during the perinatal period in couples. Methods: A randomized, single-blinded, parallel-armed, controlled trial was conducted. The study recruited 236 parents (118 couples) from an antenatal clinic of a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Eligible parents were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 118) or the control group (n = 118). The SEPP is based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory and Bowlby's theory of attachment. Components of the intervention include 2 telephone-based educational sessions (1 antenatal and 1 immediately postnatal) and a mobile health app follow-up for 1 month. The control group only received routine perinatal care provided by the hospital. Outcome measures including parenting self-efficacy (PSE), parental bonding, perceived social support, parenting satisfaction, postnatal depression (PND), and anxiety were measured using reliable and valid instruments. Data were collected over 6 months at 4 time points: during pregnancy (third trimester), 2 days postpartum, 1 month postpartum, and 3 months postpartum. Outcomes were standardized using baseline means and SDs. Linear mixed models were used to compare the groups for postpartum changes in the outcome variables. Results: The intervention group showed significantly better outcome scores than the control group from baseline to 3 months postpartum for PSE (mean difference, MD, 0.37; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.68; P = .02), parental bonding (MD -1.32; 95% CI -1.89 to -0.75; P < .001), self-perceived social support (MD 0.69; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.19; P = .01), parenting satisfaction (MD 1.40; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.93; P < .001), and PND (MD -0.91; 95% CI -1.34 to -0.49; P < .001). Postnatal anxiety (PNA) scores of the intervention group were only significantly better after adjusting for covariates (MD -0.82; 95% CI -1.15 to -0.49; P < .001). Conclusions: The technology-based SEPP is effective in enhancing parental bonding, PSE, perceived social support and parental satisfaction, and in reducing PND and PNA. Health care professionals could incorporate it with existing hands-on infant care classes and routine care to better meet parents' needs and create positive childbirth experiences, which may in turn encourage parents to have more children.

N2  - Background: Mogg and Bradley (2016) proposed that attentional bias (to threat stimuli) among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may be associated with the top-down attention control process. Additionally, some scholars (e.g., Enock & McNally, 2013) have designed mobile applications to enable patients to engage in home-delivered attentional bias modification (HD-ABM); however, many problems related to these training systems have not yet been addressed. Method: A total of 82 participants (61 women, mean age = 21.47 y) who received GAD diagnoses were randomly assigned to an HD-ABM (n = 30), placebo training (n = 30), or waiting list (n = 22) group. Both the HDABM and placebo groups were trained with the attention training application (through Android phones three times a day for four weeks). Results: (1) All measures of participants' self-reported symptoms (except for trait anxiety) were significantly lower in Week 4 and in the follow-up. (2) Attentional network test (ANT) results demonstrated that all participants' alerting scores significantly increased by Week 4. (3) Participants in the HD-ABM and placebo groups demonstrated significant increases in their self-reported attention control scores, decreases in their attention bias index (ABI) scores, and progress in their executive control abilities. Limitations: Self-report scales may have been insufficient for measuring effectiveness in the present study. Conclusions: This study helps to elucidate the mechanism underlying changes in attention processes after HDABM training implemented through a mobile application in GAD.

N2  - Introduction: Stroke survivors frequently experience a range of post-stroke deficits. Specialized stroke rehabilitation improves recovery, especially if it is started early post-stroke. However, resource limitations often preclude early rehabilitation. Mobile technologies may provide a platform for stroke survivors to begin recovery when they might not be able to otherwise. The study objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of RecoverNow, a tablet-based stroke recovery platform aimed at delivering speech and cognitive therapy. Methods: We recruited a convenience sample of 30 acute stroke patients to use RecoverNow for up to 3 months. Allied health professionals assigned specific applications based on standard of care assessments. Participants were encouraged to take home the RecoverNow tablets upon discharge from acute care. The study team contacted participants to return for a follow- up interview 3 months after enrollment. The primary outcome of interest was feasibility, defined using 5 facets: recruitment rate, adherence rate, retention rate, the proportion of successful follow-up interventions, and protocol deviations. We tracked barriers to tabletbased care as a secondary outcome. Results: We successfully recruited 30 of 62 eligible patients in 15 weeks (48% recruitment rate). Participants were non-adherent to tablet-based therapy inside and outside of acute care, using RecoverNow for a median of 12 minutes a day. Retention was high with 23 of 30 patients participating in follow-up interviews (77% retention rate) and all but 3 of the 23 interviews (87%) were successfully completed. Only 2 major protocol deviations occurred: one enrollment failure and one therapy protocol violation. Barriers to tablet-based care were frequently encountered by study participants with many expressing the assigned applications were either too easy or too difficult. Conclusions: Acute stroke patients are interested in attempting tablet-based stroke rehabilitation and are easily recruited early post-stroke. However, tablet-based therapy may be challenging due to patient, device and system-related barriers. Reducing the frequency of common barriers will be essential to keeping patients engaged in tablet-based therapy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Objective: To co-design and test the acceptability of a peer-led web-based resource (PLWR) for cancer carers to provide practical and emotional advice on common issues. Methods: A six-step co-design model informed PLWR development. Content was developed through three cancer carer workshops and monthly meetings with an expert advisory team (n = 12). User-testing was conducted via web-based survey and telephone interview. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were utilised. Google analytics explored site visits, commonly used components, and time spent using the PLWR. Results: The PLWR was developed to deliver cancer carer information tailored to each stage of the illness trajectory regardless of cancer type, in the form of videoed personal experiences. From November to May 2018, there were 2789 unique visits to the PLWR with 743 returners. The majority of time was spent on the full unclipped peer stories (414 views), and diagnosis-specific information (159 views), with less time spent on bereavement, cancer treatment, or self-care (120 views each). Fifty-five individuals completed the resource evaluation, with 10 participating in telephone interviews. Fifty-four carers rated the resource as excellent, useful, and easy to use. The web-based videos were regarded as convenient as and less burdensome than written information. The resource provided relevant information, potentially reducing isolation and uncertainty. Conclusion: The content and design of the PLWR appear acceptable to cancer carers. The co-design model is an effective way to develop appropriate information for service users and could be utilised as a framework for development of other interventions in a variety of disease groups.

N2  - The presence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with worse cognitive control. Children with ASD and ADHD often respond poorly to medications, thus we need alternative treatments. We examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Project Evo-a digital treatment. Nineteen children with ASD and co-occurring ADHD symptoms completed this app-based treatment that targets multi-tasking through gameplay versus a comparison educational treatment. Children had a high engagement with both treatments, and parents and children reported high acceptability. Within-group analyses suggest the multi-tasking but not the educational treatment may improve cognitive control. This multi-tasking treatment is feasible, acceptable, and possibly efficacious for cognitive control impairments in children with ASD and ADHD.

N2  - Over the past decade, electronic health or "eHealth" technologies have been rapidly gathering momentum, particularly in the area of mental health. This chapter describes innovative developments in mobile health ("mHealth") and gives specific examples of different technologies that are currently available. "mHealth" refers specifically to the use of mobile technologies such as smartphones, mobile devices, and wearable monitoring devices to support and advance health care. The chapter explains how mHealth interventions can be used to help people with serious mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. Additionally, it discusses the growing use of mHealth approaches for increasing physical activity, with reference to novel research published in this area. mHealth technologies provide a mechanism to deliver more accessible and effective health care. The broad clinical potential of these technologies is likely to expand, and future research should focus on identifying the most cost-effective, efficient, and feasible ways to implement mHealth within mental health care. Future research will enable the clinical potential of these new, innovative technologies to be established. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Given the rapid advances in technologies that have transformed various aspects of healthcare, this chapter describes how technology can be harnessed as another form of psychosocial intervention in the management of obesity. This chapter discusses internet- and smartphone-based interventions for obesity and weight management, and reviews empirical research. Smartphones and their accompanying applications have been used in the fields of medicine, surgery, and psychiatry. In addition, the introduction of wearable devices has also opened up opportunities for fitness and other personalized data to be collated continuously that could be used for healthcare interventions. The chapter discusses the authors' experiences in the conceptualization and implementation of Internet- and smartphone-based obesity interventions. It provides a brief description on technological advances and healthcare transformation; smartphone application-based interventions for obesity and weight management; essential features of ehealth and mhealth obesity intervention programs; and recommendations for using ehealth and mhealth interventions to enhance patient care.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Childhood obesity has become a national concern in the U.S. over the past decades. Offering quality physical education programs is one of the effective approaches of a variety of school-based physical interventions. To gain children's attention and their lack of interest in physical movement, physical education teachers have recently employed novel technologies, such as the iPad and exercise-related mobile applications. While many studies examined the effect of these devices on promoting individuals' physical activity in primary and fitness settings, few research was done on physical education settings. The purpose of this study was to examine the app-based physical education classes on children's physical activity and their psychosocial beliefs. Fourth and fifth grade children from two elementary schools (n = 157) participated in this study. Children from one school received a short-term app-based intervention while those from the other school participated in traditional physical education classes with limited technology use, serving as a comparison group. Children's sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during physical education classes was measured with accelerometers. A battery of questionnaires was used to assess children's self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, social support, and enjoyment in physical education. Children in the app-based group spent approximately 21.3% of their class time on moderate-to-vigorous activity while children in the comparison group spent approximately 30.5% of their time. Both fell far below the recommended level of spending at least 50% of the class time on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The app-based group demonstrated significantly less increased percentage of time spent in both light physical activity (--6.2% vs. 4.2%), F (1, 154) = 97.7, p < 0.001, eta2 = 0.39, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (--8.6% vs. --1.6%), F (1, 154) = 31.4, p < .001, eta p2 = 0.17. The app-based group (14.8%) also had a significantly greater increased percentage of time in sedentary behavior than the comparison group (--2.6%), F (1, 154) = 110.6, p < 0.001, eta2 = 0.42. For children's beliefs, there was no significant differences in increases of all four beliefs between the app-based group and the comparison group. Correlation analyses of children's post-tests indicated that none of the children's beliefs was significantly associated with children's physical activity, while enjoyment significantly related to the percentage of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in the comparison group. The results of the regression analyses indicated the four predictors explained 6.1 % of the variance in children's post-test moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in the app-based group, R2 = 0.06, F (4,66) = 1.07, p = 0.38. In the comparison group, the four predictors explained 9.4 % of the variance in the percentage of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, but the model was also not significant, R 2 = 0.09, F (4, 73) =1.89, p = 0.12. It appears that the app-based physical education classes were not effective in improving elementary children's physical activity and psychosocial beliefs, possibly due to a learning curve. A longer intervention period may be needed to witness true effect of app-based physical education classes on promoting children's physical activity and beliefs. It is also recommended that children themselves have more opportunities to engage in group activities using iPads and apps to benefit more from the features such as video playback to receive feedback on their own movements.

N2  - In defining self-management (SM), it is important to distinguish the behaviors that are targeted for change, the skills needed to implement change, and the outcomes that are the expected result of such efforts. Despite their differences, most theoreticians seem to converge on some common concepts that can be clearly differentiated. In this chapter, the authors draw upon four commonalities to define SM as an extended process. The four commonalities are: (1) an understanding of and commitment to the goal of assuming an active role in pain management; (2) the acquisition and implementation of a set of self-management skills (e.g., planning, self-monitoring, attention focus); (3) the establishment of various targets for change (e.g., exercise level, negative emotions, dysfunctional thoughts); and (4) the achievement of pain related distal outcomes (e.g., increased fitness, decreased suffering, reduced pain-related interference). The chapter then provides a brief overview of traditional, face-to-face pain self-management training, followed by an examination of barriers to face-to-face treatment, and a discussion of the relative benefits of online SM interventions. The chapter then returns to the organizing framework as a vehicle to evaluate existing internet-based pain self-management programs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - In low and middle income countries (LMICs), individuals with disabilities in rural communities and slum areas have poor access to health care professionals. Community based rehabilitation (CBR) workers are often enlisted to provide health and rehabilitation services to these communities. Evidence-based practices are infrequently used in these contexts due to CBR workers' lack of formal professional training. Knowledge translation of healthcare information bridges the gap between evidence-based knowledge and clinical practice. Knowledge translation is most effective when knowledge is tailored to the local context, especially if the information is being translated to a different cultural context. The Knowledge to Action framework provides guidelines to create and disseminate knowledge to local contexts. Mobile health technology, or mHealth, is an emerging medium for knowledge translation that has been used for public health programs involving training and consultation, health education, and remote health surveillance. The aim of this study was to create and effectively disseminate video-based training modules on mealtime management strategies for CBR workers and parents of children with cerebral palsy in West Bengal, India. This study was conducted in three phases: (a) developing the video-based training modules; (b) evaluating the content and presentation of the modules; and (c) assessing the medium of dissemination. The Mealtime Management Videos were developed in Phase I based on current research literature and best practices. Five prototype video modules were evaluated in Phase II using focus groups with CBR workers and caregivers of children with cerebral palsy who assessed the clarity, comprehensiveness and cultural relevance of the video modules. In addition, a series of in-home observations were conducted in urban, rural, and suburban homes in West Bengal to verify the appropriateness of the content and environmental contexts depicted in the videos. The data from Phase II indicated that the videos were easy to understand, applicable to day-to-day life, and beneficial for both CBR workers and families with children with cerebral palsy. The data also identified three content areas requiring modification: chewing, positioning, and brushing teeth. The effectiveness of the mHealth delivery medium was assessed in Phase III using focus groups and survey questions based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Twenty-four CBR workers from rural and urban locations were divided into two groups: (a) the mobile device group, and (b) the control group. Both groups were exposed to the training videos during a 1-hour introductory session that occurred at baseline. The mobile device group members were then given smartphones and encouraged to share the Mealtime Management Videos to caregivers on an as needed basis over a 4-week period. The control group members, who did not have access to the mobile videos, were encouraged to share the feeding intervention strategies using traditional demonstration methods with families over the same 4-week period. Upon conclusion of the 4-week period, the mobile device group participants reported improved knowledge and practice skills from having access to the mobile videos. Caregiver knowledge about mealtime and parent engagement in the intervention process were also reported to be greater among those families who received services from the mobile device group. The findings from this study indicated that the Knowledge to Action framework provided an effective structure for knowledge translation of a rehabilitation-related patient education program to an LMIC. The findings also indicated that mobile phones are an effective medium for dissemination of patient education content in an LMIC. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mobile devices and applications (apps) are increasingly used in clinical practice, offering reconceptualization of and novel avenues to tracking symptoms and delivery of more personalized interventions. This chapter reviews the burgeoning approaches to the integration of mobile in screening and treating individuals with eating disorders. Promising methods of data collection such as ecological momentary assessments enhance the capabilities of detecting symptoms and recognizing patterns-both are fundamental to the screening, evaluation, and monitoring of eating disorders and lay the foundations for better treatment design. More recent advances in machine learning allow ecological momentary interventions to be delivered and continuously optimized at the individual level in real time. This chapter explores what this means for the future of personalized treatment for eating disorders, referring to apps that integrate these mechanisms. Finally, the chapter provides a framework for evaluating mobile device mental health apps in clinical care. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Purpose: Delivering interventions over the lifetime of people with chronic conditions is an international healthcare challenge. The benefits of technology in healthcare have been demonstrated in many health conditions. This study aims to seek the views of People with multiple sclerosis (MS) of the feasibility and perceived acceptability of smartphone use for healthcare purposes. Methods: Using SurveyMonkeyTM, respondents answered 21 items about their smartphone use and acceptance of smartphones in healthcare. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data from closed questions. Content analysis was used for open questions. Results: Most of the self-selected 197 respondents were female (138/197;70.1%), aged 42.78 +/- 10.29 years, had relapsing-remitting MS (143/187;76.5%), and mobilized without an aid (154/197;78.17%). Most respondents reported having smartphone access (174/191;91.1%) and owning smartphones (167/192;86.97%). Perceived benefits of smartphones included improved healthcare access (119/190;62.63%) and greater independence (124/190;65.26%). The top three concerns included reduced contact with Healthcare Professionals (66/186;35.48%), data security (60/186;32.26%) and visual impairment (47/184;25.54%). Conclusion: These findings suggest that smartphone use is extensive, frequent, and acceptable for healthcare purposes in this self-selected sample. People with MS should be consulted during the design of smartphone-based interventions, as specific concerns were raised. Future studies should explore how this technology may be best used and implemented in practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Aim: The aim of this research was to evaluate CAN-Implement.Pro as a structured and systematic process for planning local evidence implementation, to develop a contextual and demographic profile of potential users and assess their initial perceptions and intention to use CAN-Implement.Pro. Methods: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Adelaide Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval number: H-2016-157). A descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken to capture the demographic characteristics of participants, as well as their initial perceptions of, and intention to use, the software for guideline adaptation projects. Results: A total of 21 individuals representing guideline groups completed the survey. Only 43% had taken part in at least one previous implementation project. Thirty-three percent reported embarking on their first implementation project; 24% had yet to participate in an evidence implementation project. Nursing was the most highly referenced profession at 75%, followed by medical specialties (40%); two respondents indicated allied health professions were included in their implementation group. Respondents represented countries or regions of high and upper middle income as classified by the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. The majority (67%) found CAN-Implement. Pro to be well-organized, easy to navigate and reliable. Most (80%) also indicated they were more likely to return to the software than not; 20% were neutral. In terms of overall satisfaction, more than half (60%) were very satisfied or satisfied, a third (33%) was neutral and 7% were dissatisfied. Over 66% of the respondents considered their group to be familiar with the knowledge-to-action model. A slightly higher percentage (74%) reported software based upon the knowledge-to-action model had a strong conceptual framework. In terms of evidence informed functionality, 75% of the respondents concluded that the software could assist guideline groups to provide structure for their implementation planning; a similar proportion (75%) indicated that the software would also enhance or improve coordination, communication and logistics management in guideline-related implementation projects. Participants were familiar with a range of resources, models, theories and frameworks for implementation, implementation planning and guideline adaptation. The most common frameworks were related to behavioural theories or variations of the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Conclusion: Eighty percent of the respondents indicated that their group would be likely to use the software to guide implementation planning in future projects, whereas 20% were neutral. In terms of expectations for contemporary software, multimedia resources rated highly, as did interactive components within the knowledge-to-action model.

N2  - Purpose of review: The purpose of this update is to provide an overview of the breadth of research studies published from April 2017 to April 2018 on mobile-based interventions for mental health, with a special emphasis on smartphone-based interventions. Recent findings: Several studies during the review period have described the process of applying user-centred design in the development of mental health apps and novel approaches to enhance user-engagement. Studies on consumer perspectives indicate largely positive findings about open-ness to utilize mental health apps. There is a scarcity of similar studies on health providers. Efficacy studies have provided evidence for apps for a variety of psychiatric disorders. There are fewer studies on preventive and promotive interventions. Although a plethora of mental health apps is available for public, most have not undergone scientific evaluation. Many well researched apps are not accessible to public. The potential of smartphone technology in enhancing healthcare service delivery in low-resource settings has also been examined in a few studies.

N2  - Comments on an article in the current issue by D. Schwebel et al. (see record 2019-23343-001). Schwebel et al. (2017) used a nonrandomized trial methodology to evaluate a smartphone-based virtual reality (VR) intervention to increase pedestrian safety in 56 schoolchildren in China. This work contributes to the literature on smartphones as a delivery mechanism and provides an opportunity to consider current practices in mHealth evaluations, including strengths, limitations, and usability testing as a means to increase generalizability. While it is important to note that this study is a pilot intervention, there are also several limitations of the current work that highlight targets for improvement. The authors note: (1) the cost of equipment (i.e., $160 US per unit); (2) the possible introduction of bias (i.e., participants wore identifiable buttons and bright colors when crossing the street); (3) protocol gaps (i.e., managing participant excitement and inattention when introducing the intervention); (4) lack of a control group; and (5) no long-term follow-up data. However, other issues central to mHealth interventions also warrant discussion. These include the clinical significance of findings (e.g., at postintervention, 80% of children still selected "Maybe" or "No" to a prompt assessing if they feel safe crossing a busy street) and the usability of the system. The present work stands as a positive representation of evaluating a smartphone-delivered intervention to improve a crucial public health target for global pediatric populations. However, it also highlights opportunities for improving generalizability. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Mobile health (mHealth) interventions include mental health apps (MHapps). There are hundreds of MHapps, which have been touted as a means of revolutionizing mental health care delivery. In spite of the rosy outlook and promise of MHapps, there are challenges to implementation in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). We report on several domains of implementation: acceptance, appropriateness, engagement, and work processes assessed in two samples of clinicians and patients designed to develop and test the feasibility of a Spanish language Cognitive Behavioral VoiceThread app for Dominican primary care patients with depression. Results indicated that feasibility of our eMH intervention was compromised by appropriateness of the target audience and the eligibility criteria used, including language, age, access to phones, and access to the internet. Both participants and clinical providers had varying degrees of engagement in the MHapp. Clinical providers had a desire for increased knowledge and capacity building, but also unspoken expectations and misaligned incentives. For participants, there were logistical and emotional barriers to use, some of which could not be fully determined in this study due to a lack of feasibility in terms of a low retention rate. Corresponding to these issues, we identified four potential solutions: 1) understanding of characteristics of end-users; 2) engagement of key stakeholders; 3) working within the existing infrastructure; and 4) addressing the social determinants of health. Unforeseen strengths also emerged as a result of our investigations. The challenges encountered in this pilot study can be viewed as evidence of failure or part of the incremental steps necessary to build future success.

N2  - Objective: This study examined the parallel-forms reliability of a web application (app) of the Activity Card Sort Australia for adults ages 18-64 and assessed its clinical utility. Method: Forty-eight participants completed the app and card versions of the tool within a 2- to 3-wk interval and provided feedback via a purpose-designed survey. Intraclass correlation analysis tested parallel-forms reliability. Results. The app demonstrated acceptable parallel-forms reliability for overall retained activity level (r = .75, p < .001), the daily life domain (r = .77, p < .001), and the recreation and relaxation domain (r = .74, p < .001), but not for the physical activity domain (r = .59, p < .001). Clinical utility responses suggested good acceptance of both versions. Conclusion. The results suggest that further studies are required before the app version can be used for research or in clinical settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 21(2)[e12015] of Journal of Medical Internet Research (see record 2019-13154-001). A number of references were identified with display errors, mostly involving names. The corrected references with new reference numbers are present in the erratum. In addition, Reference 52 was completely removed from the sentence "All studies consistently reported low baseline acceptance and an increase in acceptance following AFI [42,46,47,52]" because it did not belong to the group of studies cited in the sentence.] Background: Internet- and mobile-based interventions are effective for the treatment of chronic pain. However, little is known about patients' willingness to engage with these types of interventions and how the uptake of such interventions can be improved. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify people's acceptance, uptake, and adherence (primary outcomes) with regard to an internet- and mobile-based intervention for chronic pain and the influence of an information video as an acceptance-facilitating intervention (AFI). Methods: In this randomized controlled trial with a parallel design, we invited 489 individuals with chronic pain to participate in a Web-based survey assessing the acceptance of internet- and mobile-based interventions with the offer to receive an unguided internet- and mobile-based intervention for chronic pain after completion. Two versions of the Web-based survey (with and without AFI) were randomly sent to two groups: one with AFI (n = 245) and one without AFI (n = 244). Participants who completed the Web-based survey with or without AFI entered the intervention group or the control group, respectively. In the survey, the individuals' acceptance of pain interventions, measured with a 4-item scale (sum score ranging from 4 to 20), predictors of acceptance, sociodemographic and pain-related variables, and physical and emotional functioning were assessed. Uptake rates (log in to the intervention) and adherence (number of completed modules) to the intervention was assessed 4 months after intervention access. To examine which factors influence acceptance, uptake rate, and adherence in the internet- and mobile-based interventions, we conducted additional exploratory subgroup analyses. Results: In total, 57 (intervention group) and 58 (control group) participants in each group completed the survey and were included in the analyses. The groups did not differ with regard to acceptance, uptake rate, or adherence (P = .64, P = .56, P = .75, respectively). Most participants reported moderate (68/115, 59.1%) to high (36/115, 31.3%) acceptance, with 9.6% (11/115) showing low acceptance (intervention group: mean 13.91, SD 3.47; control group: mean 13.61, SD 3.50). Further, 67% (38/57, intervention group) and 62% (36/58, control group) had logged into the intervention. In both groups, an average of 1.04 (SD 1.51) and 1.14 (SD 1.90) modules were completed, respectively Conclusions: The informational video was not effective with regard to acceptance, uptake rate, or adherence. Despite the high acceptance, the uptake rate was only moderate and adherence was remarkably low. This study shows that acceptance can be much higher in a sample participating in an internet- and mobile-based intervention efficacy trial than in the target population in routine health care settings. Thus, future research should focus not only on acceptance and uptake facilitating interventions but also on ways to influence adherence. Further research should be conducted within routine health care settings with more representative samples of the target population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Motor vehicle collisions are the leading cause of death among North American youth, with a high prevalence of distraction-related fatalities. Youth-focused interventions must address detecting (visual scanning) and responding (adjustment to stimuli) to critical roadway information. In this repeated measures study, we investigated the feasibility (i.e., recruitment and sample characteristics; data collection procedures; acceptability of the intervention; resources; and preliminary effects) of a DriveFocusTM app intervention on youth's driving performance. Thirty-four youth participated in a 9-week protocol (retention rate = 89.7%; adherence rate = 100%). No participants experienced simulator sickness. A preliminary nonparametric evaluation of the results (n = 34) indicated a statistically significant decrease in the number of visual scanning, F(2, 68) = 3.769, p = .028, and adjustment to stimuli, F(2, 68) = 6.759, p = .002, errors between baseline, midpoint, and posttest. This study lays the foundation to support a targeted intervention trial to improve youth's attention to critical road information, building on their mobile technology preferences.

N2  - Comments on an article by Fairburn, C. G., and Patel, V. (see record 2017-03951-006). First, despite encouraging evidence regarding the effectiveness of internet-based intervention for a broad range of mental disorders, both the quality and the effectiveness of most digital interventions remain unclear. For instance, the vast majority of mental-health mobile apps and therapist-free computerized training are neither theory driven nor evidence-based. Some of these apps may even be harmful. Although supporting evidence is building, much of the research has been limited to pilot studies, often conducted by the apps' own developers rather than by independent researchers, and randomized clinical trials tend to be statistically underpowered and unreplicated. Altogether, although I agree with Fairburn and Patel that an audit of the impact of digital technology on psychological treatments and their dissemination is timely, I call for a reconsideration of their enthusiasm regarding the current evidence associated with the efficacy of digital treatments. For all the aforementioned points, I think that it is urgently critical to first foster the improvement of both the research quality and treatment adherence regarding those new digital treatments before advocating for their global dissemination.

T1  - Comparing effectiveness and user behaviors of two versions of a just-in-time adaptive weight loss smartphone app.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Research suggests that even small lapses from a weight control diet could explain suboptimal outcomes in behavioral weight loss programs. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) delivered via smartphone apps can allow for the prediction and prevention of lapse behavior through momentary alerts to risk. Our team developed an app (OnTrack) that has been programmed to: (a) record data via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) on dietary lapse behavior and variables known to predict lapses, (b) apply machine learning to determine risk of a dietary lapse, (c) alert individuals when risk is high, and (d) offer a brief text-based micro-intervention (approximately 150-250 words) tailored to momentary risk factors. Phases I and II trials of OnTrack provided initial evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the app. However, during app development, there has been a tension between reducing participant burden by assessing fewer questions at each survey and having a more complete dataset from which to generate lapse predictions. A useful study of OnTrack could empirically examine the effect of additional EMA questions per prompt on app usage behaviors (i.e., EMA adherence, accessing the library of brief interventions, and opening alerts to lapse risk), user outcomes (i.e., lapses and weight change), and the quality of algorithm predictions. The study (n=121) evaluated these research questions by randomizing participants to use either the original app (i.e., 8 questions per prompt; OT-S) or an app with a longer question distribution scheme (i.e.,17 questions per prompt; OT-L) for ten weeks. Results indicate that OT-L and OT-S did not produce equivalent EMA compliance (MOT-s =65.35% v. MOT-L=60.49%; p=.16). Regardless, the completeness of cases did have a positive influence on the quality of algorithm predictions (MOT-S=50.70% v. MOT-L=57.9% accurate). Contrary to our hypotheses, improved predictive quality did not necessitate differences in accessing momentary interventions (MOT-s=47.66% v. M OT-L=46.15% risk alerts opened; p=.12) and this is likely due to problems that can arise while predicting an event that is also being intervened upon. Consequently, there were no differences in lapse frequency (MOT-s=3.3 v. MOT-L=3.1, p=.85) or weight change (MOT-s=-3.3 v. MOT-L=-3.5 PWL; p=.82) observed across conditions. Results from the current study have important implications for the next development phases of OnTrack, provide scientific insight into the relationship between app design and user behaviors, enhance our knowledge about the appropriate methods for using machine learning to personalize intervention, and add to existing literature regarding the effectiveness of just-in-time interventions for weight loss.

T1  - Mediators and moderators in a brief mobile intervention for disordered eating.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Disordered eating is a significant and pervasive problem that is associated with substantial distress and increased risk for the later development of an eating disorder. Data support the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral interventions for disordered eating; however, the reach of existing interventions is limited. Mobile interventions have the potential to improve access to empirically-supported interventions. Before these interventions are widely disseminated, it is critical that we understand how and for whom these interventions are effective. To this end, the present study explores five potential mediators and one moderator of change within a brief, mobile mindful eating intervention targeting young adult women with disordered eating. Proposed mediators included: frequency of eating, change in mindful eating, change in self-compassion, change in emotion regulation, and change in trait mindfulness. Body mass index (BMI) was considered as a possible moderator. Participants were 189 female undergraduate and graduate students (ages 18-30) recruited for a study testing a 3-week mindful eating intervention delivered via an iPhone application ("app"). Analyses of mediation and conditional indirect effects (i.e., moderated mediation) were performed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013), and bootstrapped confidence-intervals were utilized to facilitate statistical inference. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing symptoms of disordered eating, including binge eating, dysfunctional cognitions, and preoccupation with eating and weight. Mediation analyses indicated no mediation of the direct effects from pre- to post-intervention symptoms of disordered eating through the proposed mediators with one exception, pre- to post-intervention change in preoccupation eating/weight mediated by frequency of eating. Results indicated that improvement in self-reported mindful eating, and to a lesser extent improvement in self-compassion and emotion regulation, was associated with decreased symptoms of disordered eating whether assessed post-intervention or at a 3-week follow-up. There were interesting differences in the degree to which different variables predicted outcome across various measures of disordered eating. There was no support for the hypothesized moderated mediation of the indirect effects by BMI. Together, these results support the potential utility of brief mindfulness-based interventions, identify some predictors of therapeutic change to explore further, and highlight the importance of including multiple outcome measures in intervention research.

N2  - Mobile interventions promoting positive body image are lacking. This study presents a randomized controlled evaluation of BodiMojo, a mobile application (app) intervention grounded in self-compassion to promote positive body image. A sample of 274 adolescents, mean (SD) age = 18.36 (1.34) years, 74% female, were allocated to a control group or used BodiMojo for 6 weeks. Appearance esteem, body image flexibility, appearance comparison, mood, and self-compassion were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks. Significant time by group interactions emerged for appearance esteem and self-compassion, with appearance esteem and self-compassion increasing in the intervention relative to the control group. These findings provide preliminary support for BodiMojo, a cost-effective mobile app for positive body image. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Making realistic predictions about the future is important in clinical psychology as in many other disciplines. This opinion survey aimed to examine clinical psychologists' predictions for the next 10 years regarding the status of psychotherapy in Turkey in two stages, with 107 participants in one and 69 in the other. The results revealed that the techniques predicted to increase the most in the next decade were the use of eclectic therapy, mindfulness therapy, solution-focused therapy, system/family approaches, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Among the therapeutic interventions expected to increase in popularity were Internet-based programs, smartphone applications, and problem solving. In terms of type of psychotherapists, family counselors with certificate/graduate degrees and Internet-based treatment programs were expected to become more common, whereas it was considered that shorter treatment formats and crisis intervention approaches would be preferred. In sum, the present findings provide a current overview for Turkey and a comparison with other literature findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to facilitate self-monitoring and self-management for individuals with substance use disorders (SUD). S-Health is a bilingual smartphone application based on cognitive behavioral principles and is designed to support recovery from drug addiction by trigger recognition so as to allow practice in-the-moment coping to prevent relapse. Method: For this pilot randomized controlled study, 75 participants were recruited from methadone maintenance treatment clinics and the social worker consortium in Shanghai, China. Participants in the control group (N = 25) received text messages from S-Health (e.g., HIV prevention and other educational materials). Participants in the intervention group (N = 50) received both text messages and daily surveys on cravings, affects, triggers, responses to triggers, and social contexts. Results: At the end of the 1-month study trial, 26.2% of the intervention group and 50% of the control group had positive urine test results (p = 0.06). Also, the number of days using drug in the past week was significantly lower among participants in the intervention group (Mean = 0.71, SD = 1.87) relative to the control group (Mean = 2.20, SD = 3.06) (p < 0.05). The two groups did not differ in slopes (i.e., rates of change in outcomes measured weekly) based on the mixed effects model. Participants in the intervention group also preferred answering questions on the cellphone (46.8%) relative to in-person interviews (36.2%). Conclusions: This pilot demonstrated the feasibility and potential benefits to deliver mobile health intervention among participants with SUD. Further research with larger samples over a longer period of time is needed to test the effectiveness of S-Health as a self-monitoring tool supporting recovery from addiction.

N2  - Reducing maternal mortality rate (MMR) by 75% by the year 2015 was the primary target for Millennium Development Goal 5. However, between 1990 and 2015 the MMR only fell by 50%. Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims to reduce the global MMR to 0.1% by the year 2030. Mobile technology for healthcare service delivery (mHealth) is being implemented in many developing countries to address challenges faced in maternal health in trying to achieve this goal. Existing literature on mHealth tends to focus mainly on design and implementation of mHealth projects, a few studies have evaluated mHealth interventions to assess health outcomes. This study evaluates the effectiveness of mHealth based on consumers' capabilities, and investigates how mHealth contributes towards social change and human development using the capability approach theoretical framework. The findings show that the use of mobile phones to access health information and healthcare services can generate a number of opportunities for women in maternal health, not only for health purposes but also for their informational, economic and psychological wellbeing. However, the generation of the opportunities and realisation of the outcomes is mediated by a myriad of personal, social, and environmental factors that are either enabling or restrictive.

N2  - Reports an error in "HowNutsAreTheDutch ((HoeGekIsNL): A crowdsourcing study of mental symptoms and strengths" by Lian Van Der Krieke, Bertus F. Jeronimus, Frank J. Blaauw, Rob B. K. Wanders, Ando C. Emerencia, Hendrika M. Schenk, Stijn De Vos, Evelien Snippe, Marieke Wichers, Johanna T. W. Wigman, Elisabeth H. Bos, Klaas J. Wardenaar and Peter De Jonge (International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research, 2016[Jun], Vol 25[2], 123-144). In the original article, there was an error in the estimated prevalence of depression symptom levels. The estimates were reported to be based on the cut-off norms for the DASS provided by Lovibond and Lovibond (1995). However, the stress scale cut-off was also used for the depression scale. Consequently, estimates of the prevalence of depression were too conservative, as the correct norms by Lovibond would have resulted in 26.2% participants with mild symptom levels (instead of the reported 14.8%), 16.8% with moderate levels (instead of 9.1%), 7.2% with severe symptom levels (instead of 3.9%), and 3.0% with extremely severe levels (instead of 1.3%). Importantly, the reported results based on the continuous anxiety and stress scales were not affected, and neither were all other estimations of the role of depression and of gender differences in the paper and table. None of the subsequent papers using the HowNutsAreTheDutch dataset were affected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-44271-001). HowNutsAreTheDutch (Dutch: HoeGekIsNL) is a national crowdsourcing study designed to investigate multiple continuous mental health dimensions in a sample from the general population (n = 12,503). Its main objective is to create an empirically based representation of mental strengths and vulnerabilities, accounting for (i) dimensionality and heterogeneity, (ii) interactivity between symptoms and strengths, and (iii) intra-individual variability. To do so, HowNutsAreTheDutch (HND) makes use of an internet platform that allows participants to (a) compare themselves to other participants via cross-sectional questionnaires and (b) to monitor themselves three times a day for 30 days with an intensive longitudinal diary study via their smartphone. These data enable for personalized feedback to participants, a study of profiles of mental strengths and weaknesses, and zooming into the fine-grained level of dynamic relationships between variables over time. Measuring both psychiatric symptomatology and mental strengths and resources enables for an investigation of their interactions, which may underlie the wide variety of observed mental states in the population. The present paper describes the applied methods and technology, and presents the sample characteristics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Health workers worldwide are increasingly using technology to support and improve population-based health interventions. In the last five years, several pilot programs have used technology-based interventions, known as mHealth interventions, to address the gaps in critical perinatal care associated with high maternal mortality in Nigeria. These innovations have improved health care for pregnant women and have demonstrated the potential to accelerate efforts in achieving the maternal targets of the newly launched sustainable development goals. Despite this positive trend in health technology, few innovations have been accepted into clinical practice and scaled-up beyond for-profit or small-scale campaigns. Those that have attempted scale-up have met with limited success. Reasons for this none or limited scale of mHealth interventions in Nigeria include: gaps in measuring and understanding technology adoption among healthcare users; inability to identify a comprehensive set of factors influencing technology adoption in Nigeria; and the limited information of Nigerian stakeholders' perceptions on technology adoption and scale requirements. This study provides the evidence for adopting and scaling health technology innovations to ensure future relevant dissemination and implementation. Using standardized and well-researched psychometric methods, this research applied an adapted validated instrument for measuring users' reactions to attributes of new technology. The study then created and tested a comprehensive framework for examining health workers' readiness to adopt technology. Finally, the study used key informants' interviews to qualitatively explore mHealth stakeholders' perceptions about the conditions necessary to successfully scale mHealth solutions in Nigeria. The study presents sets of recommendations to inform best practices for mHealth adoption studies, and eventual scale in Nigeria. These recommendations are specifically crafted based on the study findings to address present and future maternal health challenges in Nigeria.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - The United States has a weight problem. It's not just about food intake but also about energy consumption [97, 153]. This dissertation asks: "How can we encourage people to act in ways that are mutually beneficial for themselves and the environment?" To date, there is no single behavior intervention in the literature targets behavioral changes containing both health and pro-environmental implications. Based on emerging knowledge from research in HCI, health communication, behavior interventions, psychology, pro-environmental psychology, habit formation (tiny habit theory), and experience sampling, this work describes the design and study of the EcoSante Lifestyle Intervention, a mobile behavior intervention app that engages participants with daily challenge prompts designed to engage health and environmental action simultaneously. A study of EcoSante engaged a total of 139 participants (83.5% women, 82.1% under 35 years old) in a 20-day intervention on sustainable lifestyle. Participants were asked to complete one unique behavioral challenge on sustainable lifestyle each day (e.g., challenges related to physical activity, purchasing decisions, travel mode, healthy diet). The study used a 2 x 2 design to manipulate two independent design variables: stating health benefits of a challenge with environmental benefits together (conditions 3 & 4) versus only stating environmental benefits (conditions 1 & 2); and, asking participants to complete only researcher generated challenges (conditions 1 & 3) versus challenges generated by both researcher (on odd days) and participants themselves (on even days) (conditions 2 & 4). To complete a challenge, participants were asked to record and describe what they had done in the app. Behavior changes were measured using self-reported survey data assessed at three time stamps (pre-study survey as baseline data, post-study survey, and one-month follow-up survey) on behaviors (eating, exercise, pro-environmental), self-efficacy (general and domain-specific self-efficacies), and psychological well-being. There are six major findings: (1) A total of 1,921 challenges were completed by 139 participants - the average completion rate across all 20 challenges was 69.1%. (2) There were few between-subject effects of experimental condition -- stated health benefit in challenges and higher level of user-involvement during intervention did not lead to better performance in most outcome measures. (3) Participants' eating behavior (p<0.01) and general self-efficacy (p<0.05) improved right after the 20-day mobile intervention. (4) Participants' eating (p<0.01), exercise (p<0.05), pro-environmental (p<0.05) behaviors and general self-efficacy (p<0.05) improved in the delayed one-month post-intervention, comparing to where they were before participating in the intervention. (5) Domain-specific self-efficacies did not improve post-intervention nor one-month post-intervention. (6) More challenge completions led to improvement in pro-environmental behavior (b=0.012, 95% CI = 0.0019, 0.0213). The survey and interview data along with participants' photo and challenge descriptions also have design implications. While the majority of participants enjoyed receiving a different challenge every day, the results suggest that repetition of challenges matters. Moreover, while the content variety of challenges boosted participants' motivation and engagement, no improvements were observed in participants' domain-specific self-efficacies (nutritional and physical activity self-efficacy, personal efficacy for global warming). This could be due to the gaps in participant perception of the actual number of challenge themes and its associated benefits (health and/or environmental benefits).

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Mobile health technology is gaining currency as a means to deliver health education, symptom tracking, and communication with healthcare providers. In the field of mental health, patients have demonstrated both the willingness and the ability to use new mobile health technologies, even in the treatment of serious conditions such as schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population of the United States and is more costly to society than depression, dementia, and many other illnesses. One of the primary contributors to poor outcomes in this population is negative symptom severity, particularly motivational deficits. As such, developing new treatments to target motivational enhancement is a chief priority. In response to this pressing public health problem, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) designed a mobile application (app) that is focused on enhancing motivation in young people with schizophrenia. The app is called PRIME; the acronym stands for "Personalized Real-Time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement." PRIME is currently being evaluated in several trials at UCSF funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with research participants between the ages of 14 and 30 who have experienced a recent onset of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. This dissertation synthesizes the literature on arnotivation in the target population and research on mobile health technologies. Building upon this integrated literature review, this researcher has developed a novel psychosocial intervention. The intervention consists of individually tailored motivation coaching to be delivered via the PRIME app. The treatment model is described in depth and the final product of this study is a treatment manual for use by PRIME motivation coaches.

N2  - Objective: As a common experience in the general population, dissatisfaction with one's body is associated with a variety of psychological problems and unhealthy behaviors, including the development of eating disorders. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate an app-based intervention to reduce body dissatisfaction. Method: Participants reporting elevated levels of body dissatisfaction were randomly allocated to an app-based intervention (n = 26) or to a wait list group (n = 27). The app-based intervention included a brief counseling session and 14 days of training with the Mindtastic Body Dissatisfaction app (MT-BD). The MT-BD app uses gamification strategies to systematically foster approach of functional and avoidance of dysfunctional stimuli. The primary outcome was body dissatisfaction as assessed with the Body Dissatisfaction scale of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (Garner, 1991). Secondary outcome measures included severity of eating disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms. Results: Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in body dissatisfaction compared to the wait list group (d = -0.62). The intervention group also showed greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms compared to the wait list group (d = -0.46). Reductions in body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were sustained at a 1-month follow-up. Conclusion: We found preliminary evidence that an app-based intervention may significantly reduce body dissatisfaction. Further research using larger samples and targeting clinical populations is necessary to evaluate the potential of interventions such as MT-BD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement What is the public health significance of this article?-The results suggest that an intervention that combines a brief counseling session and an intense app-based training may significantly reduce body dissatisfaction. Given the high prevalence of body dissatisfaction in the general population and the importance of body dissatisfaction for the development and maintenance of eating disorders, findings from the study encourage research on how app-based interventions can be used to further improve the dissemination of evidence-based treatments.

N2  - This chapter focuses on how to develop tools for positive technology and more specifically, mobile emental health systems using a virtual stress counselor. The main objective is to develop a framework for mobile e-mental health systems reviewing existing e-mental health apps and discussing necessary system requirements. The chapter states that current e-mental health apps do not offer any facilities to promote social interaction between the counselor and the user. The proposed framework requires personalized interactions between a virtual counselor and a student. It provides personalized feedback to reduce stress level and enhances personal stress management strategies. This requires integration of technologies for facial expression detection, speech and emotion recognition as well as other psycho-physiological feedback. A prototype system for e-mental health has been developed and the components of the system architecture have been widely discussed including the need for a coping processor. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the tools for positive technology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Online and mobile mental health applications (apps) herald exciting new opportunities for the treatment and prevention of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs). With such rapid technological advances, it is paramount that health care innovation not be achieved to the detriment of intervention quality. Franklin et al.'s (2016) therapeutic evaluative conditioning (TEC) app is a novel and timely addition to the mobile health landscape; uncommonly for such apps, it is evidence based. There are, however, several crucial challenges to be surmounted for TEC to be successful; arguably, interventions ought to build lasting skills that can be subsequently and consciously recruited to manage distress beyond the intervention period. Furthermore, SITBs are a coping mechanism (albeit maladaptive); thus, extinguishing SITBs via TEC must be bolstered by the development of alternative coping strategies, particularly if the psychological distress that underlies SITBs is not addressed therapeutically. Stigma exacerbates the psychological distress of those engaging in SITBs; therefore, we question whether the types of stimuli employed in TEC may further add to this stigma, potentially affecting future help seeking. One solution may be to explore a positive-only TEC; enhancing positive self-worth may provide a more sustainable and meaningful treatment target, particularly when used as an adjunct to therapy or as a waiting list intervention. Mobile interventions for SITBs bring unique ethical challenges, including individuals' right to be fully informed about potentially distressing stimuli. This commentary aims to highlight the methodological and ethical challenges faced by TEC and encourage further discussion around this topic. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement What is the public health significance of this article?-This commentary highlights pressing ethical and methodological issues for development of mobile health applications for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. Whilst the study by Franklin et al shows that TEC holds promise, the maintenance of behavior change does not appear to persist, potentially limiting the long-term efficacy of TEC. The exact mechanism(s) by which TEC effects behavior change is not known; Whether a positive-only TEC may be equally or more effective is an empirical question and would resolve many ethical concerns regarding the app. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - In this response to the commentary by Nielsen, Kirtley, & Townsend (in press), the authors note several points of agreement related to further testing of therapeutic evaluative conditioning (TEC) for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs), navigating logistical and ethical issues surrounding mobile interventions, and integrating such interventions into traditional practice. They also note a common mission held by Nielsen et al., themselves, and the SITB research community more broadly: the large-scale reduction of SITBs. Given that national rates of SITBs have never declined appreciably and have been on the rise in recent decades, there is an urgent need for progress toward this goal. However, they also highlight several unsupported or inaccurate assumptions and specific points made by Nielsen et al. that are important to correct for the sake of accuracy and progress in the prediction and prevention of SITBs. These include an overly narrow conceptualization of what constitutes an intervention; an unsupported model of the causes of SITBs and how to best prevent them; an erroneous belief about the iatrogenic effects of SITB stimulus exposure; and inaccuracies in their description of the development, testing, and release of TEC. The authors hope that this brief discussion of the evidence will facilitate progress toward the mission of large-scale reductions in SITBs.

N2  - Background: Smartphone technology enables treatment providers to deliver targeted outpatient support "on site" in "real time," but this will require a better understanding of peer networks and substance users' acquisition of drugs. Objectives: This study sought to understand contextual factors associated with risky levels of alcohol consumption. Methods: A total of 280 participants answered an online survey, completed the AUDIT and indicated their numbers of regular drinking partners, and the number of times and places alcohol was normally consumed. Results: Hazardous drinkers had a greater number of drinking partners and drank alcohol at a greater number of times and locations. Alcohol dependence was associated with alcohol use in more times and places, but was not linked to the numbers of drinking partners. Models drawn from foraging literature were used to describe the data. Conclusions/Importance: Patterns of alcohol foraging could be described by power laws, and such power laws could be used to compare foraging for a range of substances. A consideration of foraging behavior may inform location-aware services targeting risky substance use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Multitiered frameworks like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) have been recommended for preventing and remediating behavior problems. In this study, technology-based self-monitoring was used as a Tier 2 intervention to improve the academic engagement and disruptive behavior of three middle school students who were identified as at risk for failure and needing immediate intervention. Results of the multiple baseline design across settings indicated the intervention was highly effective for one student and moderately effective for another. The third student required more intense support than offered in Tier 2. Issues of matching students to Tier 2 intervention based on multiple data sources, the alignment of technology-based self-monitoring with key features of Tier 2, limitations of the study, recommendations for future research, and implications for practice are discussed.

N2  - Comments on an article by G. Glick et al. (see record 2016-46047-007). This paper is both timely and important. mHealth interventions are being developed across the world but their ability to integrate with varying patient populations has not been properly looked into. This paper concludes that patients with a serious mental illness are less likely to own a mobile phone or smartphone when compared to the general population. Furthermore, smartphone penetrance alone will not ensure acceptance and uptake of a mobile health solution. More research needs to be done to identify why certain patient groups are more accepting of an intervention and what factors yield success in the continued use of mHealth. This will help guide developers and healthcare professionals in their use and commissioning of patientfacing mHealth programmes. This study is an important piece of research but one which needs to be repeated with an improved protocol and larger sample size in various patient groups. mHealth could improve self-management whilst reducing the cost for many healthcare services but further enquiry is required to ensure it achieve maximum success in the most appropriate patient populations.

N2  - Smoking lapses early on during a quit attempt are highly predictive of failing to quit. A large proportion of these lapses are driven by cravings brought about by situational and environmental cues. Use of cognitive-behavioral lapse prevention strategies to combat cue-induced cravings is associated with a reduced risk of lapse, but evidence is lacking in how these strategies can be effectively promoted. Unlike most traditional methods of delivering behavioral support, mobile phones can in principle deliver automated support, including lapse prevention strategy recommendations, Just-In-Time (JIT) for when a smoker is most vulnerable, and prevent early lapse. JIT support can be activated by smokers themselves (user-triggered), by prespecified rules (server-triggered) or through sensors that dynamically monitor a smoker's context and trigger support when a high risk environment is sensed (context-triggered), also known as a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI). However, research suggests that user-triggered JIT cessation support is seldom used and existing server-triggered JIT support is likely to lack sufficient accuracy to effectively target highrisk situations in real time. Evaluations of mobile phone cessation interventions that include user and/or server-triggered JIT support have yet to adequately assess whether this improves management of high risk situations. While context-triggered systems have the greatest potential to deliver JIT support, there are, as yet, no impact evaluations of such systems. Although it may soon be feasible to learn about and monitor a smoker's context unobtrusively using their smartphone without burdensome data entry, there are several potential advantages to involving the smoker in data collection.

N2  - Comments on an article by A. Skinner et al. (see record 2017-25281-012). Skinner et al. promises innovative ways of harnessing smart phones, global positioning system (GPS) tracking and wearable technology, which would facilitate behavior change techniques that capture bodily actions and account more accurately for the drinking location. Skinner et al.'s proposals include interventions utilizing a social norms approach, consideration is required as to how these norms may vary by context and further, how this may be captured and harnessed to achieve public health gains. The kinds of personalized digital interventions discussed by Skinner et al. may be incorporated into everyday life and set in the context of people's responsibilities, pleasures and values. Skinner et al. incorporated into everyday life and set in the context of people's responsibilities, pleasures and values. Using digital devices in the ways suggested by Skinner et al. predominantly supports a conceptualization of health that is rooted in individual responsibility and behavior change.

N2  - Background: Core needle biopsy is a reliable diagnostic test for breast cancer. Although this procedure is a reliable diagnosis tool that can improve chances of successful treatment and survival, it can be associated with pain and anxiety. In this context, a mobile health intervention (BIO H-App) has been developed to address patients' symptoms of pain and anxiety through a relaxation exercise. In order to reduce patients' burden, the intervention was designed to be delivered through mobile devices (e.g., tablets, smartphones). Aims: To conduct a pilot study in order to obtain usability data and to assess users' satisfaction with the BIO H-App intervention. Method: Participants (N = 16, mean age=42.43), were recruited online. The study consisted of three steps: 1) the online pre-test survey, 2) use of the BIO H-App, and 3) a post-test survey. Results: Participants found the intervention component to be useful and a majority of them (75%) declared they would recommend the application to a patient. All tasks were completed successfully and participants were satisfied with the intervention. Conclusions: Although its efficacy needs to be evaluated, BIO-H App is a promising intervention considering users' satisfaction with it and its ease of use.

N2  - Rapid technological development has challenged researchers developing mobile moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) interventions. This 12-week randomized factorial intervention aimed to determine the individual and combined impact of a self-monitoring smartphone-app (tracking, feedback, education) and two theory-based modules (goal-setting, points-based feedback) on MVPA, key psychosocial outcomes, and application usage. Adults (N = 116; Mage = 41.38 +/- 7.57) received (1) a basic self-monitoring app, (2) the basic app plus goal setting, (3) the basic app plus points-based feedback, or (4) the basic app plus both modules. All individuals increased MVPA by more than 11 daily minutes. Those with points-based feedback demonstrated still higher levels of MVPA and more favorable psychosocial and app usage outcomes across the intervention. Those with access to in-app goal setting had higher levels of app usage relative to those without the component. It is imperative that effective digital intervention "ingredients" are identified, and these findings provide early evidence to this effect.

N2  - SuperBetter is a family of interfaces including a browser-based game, an online forum, and a companion mobile application that collectively seek to "gamify" resilience, wellness, motivation, and mental health. Players register and use "gamified" components and content to address mental and physical health challenges and to pursue identified goals. The primary strength of the SuperBetter ecosystem is its innovative approach, drawing on gaming metaphors and the use of evidence-based strategies in both its design and provided content. Efforts in creating an engaging, playable system incentivizing users' incremental steps towards larger goals are constrained by SuperBetter's relative lack of structure and direction, limits to meaningful progress monitoring, its largely static content regardless of varied user goals, and broad concerns regarding the utility of the overall system. The program presents a potential model for the application of gaming techniques and design to the dissemination of clinically effective concepts to a larger consumer market, but presently lacks sufficient empirical support for claims of evidence-based effectiveness.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Introduction: The multi-step cascade of care for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) paves the way to potentially eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission; yet, it also lays the foundation for attrition and disengagement from care, increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality for both mother and child. We recently concluded a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Kenya where we developed text messages using a behavioral theoretical framework and found that this "texting to improve testing" (TextIT) strategy significantly improved maternal retention in postpartum PMTCT care and rates of infant HIV testing. The goals of this dissertation were to understand "why" and "how" the intervention worked. Methods: We conducted a "parallel cohort RCT" comparison of infant HIV testing rates in RCT non-participants (reference category) versus control, and intervention group participants (chapter 2). We also conducted a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial in western Kenya to determine the real-world effect of TextIT on infant HIV testing within eight weeks after birth (chapter 3), and maternal retention in postpartum HIV care (chapter 4). Results: Chapter 2: Compared to trial-ineligible participants, women in the control group of the TextIT RCT (hazard ratio [HR] 2.82; 95% CI 2.29-3.48) and the trial SMS group (HR 3.48; 95% CI 2.84-4.27) were more likely to have their infants tested for HIV. Chapter 3: A greater proportion of infants in the intervention group received HIV testing compared with the standard care group, but the difference was small, and not statistically significant (relative risk [RR] 1.05; 95% CI 0.98-1.12; p=0.2). Chapter 4: TextIT led to a significant improvement in postpartum retention in PMTCT compared to standard care (RR 1.18; 95% CI 1.01-1.39; p=0.04). Conclusions: The combined results of Chapters 2 and 3 could be interpreted as showing that simply paying more attention to infant HIV testing within PMTCT programs can achieve fairly high rates of testing even without the SMS part of the intervention. The results in Chapter 4 go a step further, showing that the SMS component of the intervention can be a powerful adjunct to a functional health system to bolster maternal retention in early postpartum PMTCT care.

N2  - The recent arrival of smartphone-sensing methods has made it possible to objectively track consequential everyday health-related behaviors rather than rely on self-reports. To evaluate the viability of using sensing methods to monitor such behaviors in detail, the present research used a smartphone-sensing application to describe the patterns of stability and change that characterize a cohort of students' activity and sociability behaviors over the course of a 10-week academic term. Data were collected from 48 students using a smartphone-sensing application, StudentLife, which was designed to track daily durations of activity (via the accelerometer sensor) and sociability (via the microphone sensor). Results showed stability estimates were moderate to high for activity (rmean = 0.66) and sociability (rmean = 0.72) across the 10 weeks. Students started the term with generally healthy levels of activity (M = 1.87 h) and sociability (M = 4.99 h), which then dropped (activity by 0.42 h, sociability by 0.90 h) over the first half of the term (i.e., before midterm exams). Over the second half of the term, activity levels did not change but sociability increased (by 0.88 h). Students' ethnicity and academic class predicted variation in the activity and sociability trajectories. Discussion focuses on the implications of our results for designing mHealth interventions to address consequential student outcomes (e.g., mental health, physical health).

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Health apps are widely used and accepted by consumers. However, the clinical benefit of many commercially available health apps is unknown. The current project evaluated a commercially available mindfulness training app, HeadspaceRTM, with regard to quality of life (QOL), among women with breast cancer. App-based mindfulness training (AMT) intervention uptake, with respect to participants' health literacy, eHealth literacy, and perception of the app's usability, were also evaluated. Using a randomized controlled trial study design, QOL was evaluated among ( N = 95) women with a recent (< 5 years) breast cancer diagnosis. Participants were randomly assigned to 1) AMT or 2) waitlist control (WC). Participants assigned to AMT piloted the HeadspaceRTM app for 8-weeks and participants assigned to WC received the app at completion of 4-week follow-up. Participants completed web-based assessments at 4 observation points: baseline, week 5, week 9, and 4-week follow-up. Overall findings reveal higher QOL over time among participants assigned to AMT, compared to WC. Although the degree of change in mindfulness did not appear to be statistically significant, a post hoc analysis using a subset of the sample revealed detectable improvement in mindfulness among AMT compared to WC. Overall, participants' eHealth literacy, and perceived app usability were not associated with app utilization. Further, app usability did not appear to be associated with mindfulness at 4-week follow-up. Delivering mindfulness training using an app-based approach may be feasible for women with breast cancer. However, these findings may not extend to other mindfulness training apps. Additional research is needed to evaluate AMT in other settings, with a larger sample. Findings from this exploratory study may have implications for the delivery of future app-based interventions targeted toward this clinical population.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - High rates of depression and anxiety have been consistently found associated with poor treatment adherence and outcomes among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and this is worrisome when taking into account that previous research has found that only 19% of PLWH in the US currently meet the criteria for suppressed virus. Given the pervasiveness of mobile devices in the last few years (smartphones, cell phones, tablets, wearable devices), as well as their decreasing cost to the public, mHealth (mobile health) has been proposed as an intervention to improve outcomes of chronic diseases that rely on medical regimens or health behavior modification. Despite limited availability of rigorous evaluation methods and scarce evidence regarding efficacy, the number of apps available in the marketplace with either health, fitness, or medical purposes have recently increased to a staggering 97,000 and counting. However, few US-based research have focused on developing mHealth interventions to improve care of people living with HIV (PLWH) so far. Of these, the majority have targeted either on improving ART treatment adherence, infection prevention, and comorbidity with substance abuse. The main goal of this investigation was to serve as starting point in the development process of a mobile application that will help to manage HIV-related conditions among PLWH by: a) identifying individual characteristics associated with the intention to use mHealth to manage HIV-related mental health conditions, b) determining its relationship with screening positive for depression and anxiety and 3) assessing barriers and facilitators to use mHealth among PLWH.

N2  - This chapter focuses on how to develop tools for positive technology and more specifically, mobile e-mental health systems using a virtual stress counselor. The main objective is to develop a framework for mobile e-mental health systems reviewing existing e-mental health apps and discussing necessary system requirements. The chapter states that current e-mental health apps do not offer any facilities to promote social interaction between the counselor and the user. The proposed framework requires personalized interactions between a virtual counselor and a student. It provides personalized feedback to reduce stress level and enhances personal stress management strategies. This requires integration of technologies for facial expression detection, speech and emotion recognition as well as other psycho-physiological feedback. A prototype system for e-mental health has been developed and the components of the system architecture have been widely discussed including the need for a coping processor. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the tools for positive technology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Social media and mobile devices are rapidly evolving environments for health interventions. There is growing recognition that traditional research processes cannot keep pace with this constantly shifting landscape. The changing technology landscape demands mHealth researchers use appropriate methods throughout the development cycle. Novel research methods allow researchers to capitalize on technological advances and more rapidly disseminate research findings. This manuscript reviews three iterative health behavior intervention development and research methodologies: Agile, Multiphase Optimization Strategy, and the mHealth Development and Evaluation Framework. This manuscript presents benefits and challenges of using such methodologies for mHealth interventions through selected case examples of these methods in practice.

N2  - Background: Mobile technology may serve as a cost-effective and scalable tool for delivering behavioral nutrition interventions. This research sought to iteratively develop a theory-driven mobile app, Vegethon, to increase vegetable consumption. Methods: Development of Vegethon followed phases outlined by the IDEAS framework: 1) empathize with users (qualitative interviews, n = 18); 2) specify target behavior; 3) ground in behavioral theory; 4) ideate implementation strategies; 5) prototype potential products; 6) gather user feedback (qualitative interviews, n = 14; questionnaire, n = 41); 7) build minimum viable product; and 8) pilot potential efficacy and usability (pilot RCT, n = 17). Findings from each phase informed subsequent phases. The target population that informed intervention development was 18-50 years of age, had BMIs of 28-40 kg/m2, and lived in the geographical area surrounding Stanford University. A full description of the final version of Vegethon is included in the paper. Results: Qualitative findings that shaped initial intervention conception were: participants' interests in accountability without judgment; their desire for simple and efficient dietary self-monitoring; and the importance of planning meals in advance. Qualitative findings identified during intervention refinement were the need for a focus on vegetable self-monitoring; inclusion of vegetable challenges; simplification of features; advice and inspiration for eating vegetables; reminder notifications; and peer comparison. Pilot RCT findings suggested the initial efficacy, acceptance, and feasibility of the intervention. The final version of Vegethon enabled easy self-monitoring of vegetable consumption and included a range of features designed to engage the user (e.g., surprise challenges; leaderboard; weekly reports). Vegethon was coded for its inclusion of 18 behavior change techniques (BCTs) (e.g., goal setting; feedback; social comparison; prompts/cues; framing/reframing; identity). Conclusions: Vegethon is a theory-based, user-informed mobile intervention that was systematically developed using the IDEAS framework. Vegethon targets increased vegetable consumption among overweight adults and is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial.

N2  - This article discusses the assessment and intervention possibilities for redeeming the smartphone. Among other things, human change depends on self-awareness and self-reflection. But the pace and distractions of modern life often crowd out self-reflection. Technology, especially mobile technology, has made it easy to fill our downtime with various distractions, limiting capacity for awareness and even empathy. Psychological research and clinical assessment have often relied heavily on surveys and retrospective self-reports, despite limited ability to recall the past. Smartphones can become important tools in the promotion of well-being and human flourishing. The efforts will inform more traditional clinical trial research, as well as uncover new ideas for mobile intervention. Mobile technology is shaping us for better and worse.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - The history of science is rich in examples of the importance of theories and hypotheses. Among the various disciplines of science, theories and hypotheses have been important in guiding research, including such large ideas as the atomic theory, theory of evolution, laws of motion in physics, and plate tectonics. One of the major ways science progresses is to gather evidence in relation to theories and hypotheses and to refine our explanations of how natural events occur both at very small scales of space and time or at the level of the universe. This dissertation research focused on understanding science teachers' conceptual models about theories, and the use of corroborating evidence based on a critical rationalist stance in science. The study explored a sample of science teachers' level of understanding of critical rationalism, and issues in modeling science within a `critical rationalist', post-positivist framework. During the initial phase of the research, a pilot study was done to gather contextual evidence obtained from a sample of teachers' views on the nature of science (NOS) who responded to an online questionnaire. Subsequently, a more comprehensive study based on the findings from this initial pilot study was done. In the subsequent more comprehensive study, an online learning module on NOS, containing core concepts within a critical rational stance, was presented to a second sample of pre- and in-service teachers. This module specifically focused on how theories are initiated and rigorously tested under the highest risk conditions within a critical rationalist model. It also explained why this is a more productive approach than an exclusively verificationist cognitive framework underlying some logical positivist approaches. The results of a pretest, and post-test assessment, following the completion of the online learning module, provided robust evidence that the teachers who initially demonstrated significantly weak understandings of a critical rational stance improved to a level where they reached a preset benchmark level of accomplishment established by the researcher prior to the online intervention. The pretest results of the comprehensive study also aligned well with the results of the pilot study. That is, science teachers' pre-learning views on scientific theories and experimentation fall mostly within inductive verification-based models, more closely aligned with a positivistic worldview, outside of a contemporary critical rationalist view of a hypothetico-deductive or falsification approach. In this study, a convenient and reliable method of online learning and associated assessment instruments regarding critical rationalist understanding of NOS is presented and evaluated. The evaluation of the pre- and post-learning assessments, and analyses of questionnaire responses by the participants, showed that the use of the online learning module significantly improved science teachers' cognitive understandings of the nature of science, and that the learners generally reported favorable responses about the learning experiences based on quantitative and qualitative evidence. Based on this initial evidence, the online learning module and related assessment instruments appear to be a valuable resource for assessing teacher understanding of a modern critical rational view of science, and as a potentially productive way to introduce pre-service and in-service teachers to these modern views of NOS through application of the online learning module.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - This study was conducted to investigate the impact of Web 2.0 interventions on students' reading achievement. The urban middle school implemented the district-mandated response to intervention and instruction framework beginning in the 2014-2015 school year. This study focused on a sixth grade classroom using the digital intervention tool, i-Ready. Additionally, AIMSweb curriculum-based measures were used as universal screeners to measure i-Ready's impact on the students' reading achievement. Further, the Motivation to Read Questionnaire was used as a pre and posttest to measure 11 intrinsic and extrinsic reading constructs. Because of the district's initial implementation of the response to intervention and instruction framework, many limitations surfaced. Therefore, the findings from the study were inconclusive.

N2  - Reports an error in "Cell Phone Intervention for You (CITY): A randomized, controlled trial of behavioral weight loss intervention for young adults using mobile technology" by Laura P. Svetkey, Bryan C. Batch, Pao-Hwa Lin, Stephen S. Intille, Leonor Corsino, Crystal C. Tyson, Hayden B. Bosworth, Steven C. Grambow, Corrine Voils, Catherine Loria, John A. Gallis, Jenifer Schwager and Gary B. Bennett (Obesity, 2015[Nov], Vol 23[11], 2133-2141). In the original article, author Gary G. Bennett's name was incorrectly displayed as Bennett, G.B. The correctly displayed name is Bennett, G.G.. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-50580-001). Objective: To determine the effect on weight of two mobile technology-based (mHealth) behavioral weight loss interventions in young adults. Methods: Randomized, controlled comparative effectiveness trial in 18- to 35-year-olds with BMI >=25 kg/m2 (overweight/obese), with participants randomized to 24 months of mHealth intervention delivered by interactive smartphone application on a cell phone (CP); personal coaching enhanced by smartphone self-monitoring (PC); or Control. Results: The 365 randomized participants had mean baseline BMI of 35 kg/m2. Final weight was measured in 86% of participants. CP was not superior to Control at any measurement point. PC participants lost significantly more weight than Controls at 6 months (net effect -1.92 kg [CI -3.17, -0.67], P = 0.003), but not at 12 and 24 months. Conclusions: Despite high intervention engagement and study retention, the inclusion of behavioral principles and tools in both interventions, and weight loss in all treatment groups, CP did not lead to weight loss, and PC did not lead to sustained weight loss relative to Control. Although mHealth solutions offer broad dissemination and scalability, the CITY results sound a cautionary note concerning intervention delivery by mobile applications. Effective intervention may require the efficiency of mobile technology, the social support and human interaction of personal coaching, and an adaptive approach to intervention design.

T1  - Use of an interactive web-based platform, founded on constructs from the social cognitive theory, to benefit eating competence.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Since Web-based interventions have a significantly high rate of attrition ranging from 99.5% to 77.5%, the researcher employed an instrumental case study approach to understand compliance in a Web-portal. The specific issue for this study was attrition rates and how SCT constructs affected eating competence. Qualitative data provided ground zero insight to a complex issue that was further understood. To better understand the phenomenon, participants that registered for the 30-day study and the software developer were interviewed. All interviews (n=6) were transcribed and data from the transcriptions were transformed from dialogues, into categories, then themes, and finally into concepts. Five guidelines to keep attrition rates low was the outcome of the data analysis. Having a nation interested in the Internet and at the same time faced with an obesity epidemic seemed to be a good fit for researching a method to promote eating competence with interactive technology. Eating competence intertwines four components: (1) attitudes about eating and the enjoyment of food (2) accepting new food to add variety to your diet (3) being able to eat the right amount of food and (4) being able to manage food through proper planning, storing, preparing, and offering. With the above information extracted from the literature, it was determined, a serious enough problem existed to justify spending time, money and other resources to develop and implement an intervention. The theoretical framework supporting the development of the web portal is the social cognitive theory (SCT). In health promotion, the purpose of the SCT is to help people stay healthy through good self-management of health habits. This dissertation focused on four constructs: self-efficacy, behavioral capabilities, observational learning, and reinforcement to better understand how eating competence skills were enhanced and attrition rates lowered.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) services are growing in importance in health care research with the advancement of wireless networks, tablets, and mobile phone technologies. These technologies offer a wide range of applications that cover the spectrum of health care delivery. Although preliminary experiments in mHealth demonstrate promising results, more robust real-world evidence is needed for widespread adoption and sustainment of these technologies. Objective: Our aim was to identify the problems/challenges associated with sustained use of an mHealth addiction recovery support app and to determine strategies used by agencies that successfully sustained client use of A-CHESS. Methods: Qualitative inquiry assessed staff perceptions about organizational attributes and strategies associated with sustained use of the mobile app, A-CHESS. A total of 73 interviews of clinicians and administrators were conducted. The initial interviews (n = 36) occurred at the implementation of A-CHESS. Follow-up interviews (n = 37) occurred approximately 12 and 24 months later. A coding scheme was developed and Multiuser NVivo was used to manage and analyze the blinded interview data. Results: Successful strategies used by treatment providers to sustain A-CHESS included (1) strong leadership support, (2) use of client feedback reports to follow up on non-engaged clients, (3) identify passionate staff and incorporate A-CHESS discussions in weekly meetings, (4) develop A-CHESS guidelines related to client use, (5) establish internal work groups to engage clients, and (6) establish a financial strategy to sustain A-CHESS use. The study also identified attributes of A-CHESS that enhanced as well as inhibited its sustainability. Conclusions: Mobile apps can play an important role in health care delivery. However, providers will need to develop strategies for engaging both staff and patients in ongoing use of the apps. They will also need to rework business processes to accommodate the changes in communication frequency and style, learn to use app data for decision making, and identify financing mechanisms for supporting these changes.

N2  - Reports an error in "Designing messaging to engage patients in an online suicide prevention intervention: Survey results from patients with current suicidal ideation" by Ursula Whiteside, Anita Lungu, Julie Richards, Gregory E. Simon, Sarah Clingan, Jaeden Siler, Lorilei Snyder and Evette Ludman (Journal of Medical Internet Research, 2014[Feb], Vol 16[2], 20-27). In the original article, the authors have inadvertently added the same image file for Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 has now been updated with the correct image, with the caption "I would like to open a message with Subject Line...". (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-11878-004). Background: Computerized, Internet-delivered interventions can be efficacious; however, uptake and maintaining sustained client engagement are still big challenges. We see the development of effective engagement strategies as the next frontier in online health interventions, an area where much creative research has begun. We also argue that for engagement strategies to accomplish their purpose with novel targeted populations, they need to be tailored to such populations (ie, content is designed with the target population in mind). User-centered design frameworks provide a theoretical foundation for increasing user engagement and uptake by including users in development. However, deciding how to implement this approach to enage users in mental health intervention development is challenging. Objective: The aim of this study was to get user input and feedback on acceptability of messaging content intended to engage suicidal individuals. Methods: In March 2013, clinic intake staff distributed flyers announcing the study, "Your Feedback Counts" to potential participants (individuals waiting to be seen for a mental health appointment) together with the Patient Health Questionnaire. The flyer explained that a score of two or three ("more than half the days" or "nearly every day" respectively) on the suicide ideation question made them eligible to provide feedback on components of a suicide prevention intervention under development. The patient could access an anonymous online survey by following a link. After providing consent online, participants completed the anonymous survey. Results: Thirty-four individuals provided data on past demographic information. Participants reported that they would be most drawn to an intervention where they knew that they were cared about, that was personalized, that others like them had found it helpful, and that included examples with real people. Participants preferred email invitations with subject lines expressing concern and availability of extra resources. Participants also provided feedback about a media prototype including a brand design and advertisement video for introducing the intervention. Conclusions: This paper provides one model (including development of an engagement survey, audience for an engagement survey, methods for presenting results of an engagement survey) for including target users in the development of uptake strategies for online mental health interventions.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Virtues, broadly understood as stable and robust dispositions for certain responses across morally relevant situations, have been a growing topic of interest in psychology. A central topic of discussion has been whether studies showing that situations can strongly influence our responses provide evidence against the existence of virtues (as a kind of stable and robust disposition). In this review, we examine reasons for thinking that the prevailing methods for examining situational influences are limited in their ability to test dispositional stability and robustness; or, then, whether virtues exist. We make the case that these limitations can be addressed by aggregating repeated, cross-situational assessments of environmental, psychological and physiological variables within everyday life-a form of assessment often called ecological momentary assessment (EMA, or experience sampling).We, then, examine how advances in smartphone application (app) technology, and their mass adoption, make these mobile devices an unprecedented vehicle for EMA and, thus, the psychological study of virtue. We, additionally, examine how smartphones might be used for virtue development by promoting changes in thought and behavior within daily life; a technique often called ecological momentary intervention (EMI). While EMA/I have become widely employed since the 1980s for the purposes of understanding and promoting change amongst clinical populations, few EMA/I studies have been devoted to understanding or promoting virtues within non-clinical populations. Further, most EMA/I studies have relied on journaling, PDAs, phone calls and/or text messaging systems. We explore how smartphone app technology provides a means of making EMA a more robust psychological method, EMI a more robust way of promoting positive change, and, as a result, opens up new possibilities for studying and promoting virtues.

N2  - Advances in wireless devices and mobile technology offer many opportunities for delivering just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs)-suites of interventions that adapt over time to an individual's changing status and circumstances with the goal to address the individual's need for support, whenever this need arises. A major challenge confronting behavioral scientists aiming to develop a JITAI concerns the selection and integration of existing empirical, theoretical and practical evidence into a scientific model that can inform the construction of a JITAI and help identify scientific gaps. The purpose of this paper is to establish a pragmatic framework that can be used to organize existing evidence into a useful model for JITAI construction. This framework involves clarifying the conceptual purpose of a JITAI, namely, the provision of just-in-time support via adaptation, as well as describing the components of a JITAI and articulating a list of concrete questions to guide the establishment of a useful model for JITAI construction. The proposed framework includes an organizing scheme for translating the relatively static scientific models underlying many health behavior interventions into a more dynamic model that better incorporates the element of time. This framework will help to guide the next generation of empirical work to support the creation of effective JITAIs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Advances in technology have made it possible for many standard diagnostic and health monitoring procedures, traditionally carried out by qualified personnel within medical facilities, to be reliably undertaken by patients or carers in their own homes with a minimum of basic training. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to 'empower' patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs. It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context.

N2  - This provocative volume updates L'Abate's signature ideas, focusing in particular on the concepts of concreteness and specificity as basic tenets of evaluation and therapy. Noting society's growing familiarity with technology, current concerns about treatment accessibility, and widespread interest in wellness promotion, he argues for remote-writing exercises targeted to specific client issues and monitored by the clinician instead of relying on traditional talk-based therapy. This attention to concreteness and specificity in baseline evaluation, post-treatment evaluation, and follow-up, the author asserts, is central to making treatment replicable, less subject to impasses or missteps, and more professional, with the potential of changing how therapy is conducted as well as how clinicians are trained and practice. The book's framework includes rationales, models, empirical data, and examples of prescriptive remote-writing exercises. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - mHealth refers to the use of mobile technologies in the provision of health care and is an expanding field within psychotherapy research. Mobile technologies have the capacity to greatly enhance patient access, uptake, and engagement in psychological treatment. The purpose of the present article is to define mHealth within clinical psychology, provide a review and discussion of the functionality of mHealth devices, current trends within the field of psychological mHealth, the challenges faced by researchers and clinicians in this field, and examine directions for future research. The main areas of research identified included the use of SMS technologies, ecological momentary assessment, online and software application-based interventions and the recent integration of sensor and data mining technologies. Much of the research to date is lacking in methodological rigor, and reliance on standard research designs often used in other areas of psychological research may constrain development of interventions. Research indicates that consumers want to engage in mHealth interventions, although only a limited number of empirically supported options currently exist. Future research incorporating innovative trial designs is required to meet consumer demand and provide users with evidence-based treatment options.

N2  - In prevention and treatment research, a mediation framework helps researchers understand how an intervention changes an outcome by first changing a mediating variable. Mediation analysis is an important component in evaluating technology-based interventions, as it can provide evidence of how an intervention achieved its effects. The purpose of this chapter is to describe how mediation analysis can be incorporated into technology-based research. We begin by providing a broad overview of mediation that applies to both technological and non-technological contexts. Later, we discuss issues particular to mediation with technology-based interventions. We start with the cross-sectional mediation model for data collected from each participant at only one timepoint during a study. As an example of a cross-sectional mediation study, consider an intervention for test anxiety. The intervention or control procedure (X) is delivered immediately prior to a test. At the same time as delivery of the test, researchers also collect a measure of anxiety (M), which is thought to mediate the relationship between the intervention and the outcome, test performance (Y). Mediation analysis addresses whether the intervention improved test performance, and whether decreases in anxiety mediated the effect. We then describe the multilevel longitudinal mediation model, where measurement of X, M, and/or Y occurs at multiple points in time. Using the test anxiety example, the intervention may be enrollment in a special English class that includes anxiety program components, with the control being a normal English class (X), and anxiety (M) and test performance (Y) may be measured monthly over a school year. Because the values of M and Y may vary over time, the data require longitudinal mediation analyses. We focus on a type of multilevel mediation model specific to the case of repeated measures of the intervention (X), the mediating variable (M), and the dependent variable (Y). Finally, we describe how the longitudinal mediation model can answer questions using technology-based tools such as ecological momentary assessment and ecological momentary intervention. Our overall goals are to provide an overview of mediation in technology-based interventions, and to encourage researchers to apply these models to understand mediation processes in their research studies.

N2  - this chapter, we gave a brief overview on applications of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) in behavioral medicine. EMA has evolved to become the gold standard for the assessment of in situ self-reports. This holds for self-reported symptoms or psychological variables, as well as self-reported behaviors. Recent technological developments, such as EMA implemented on smartphones, make the method much more accessible for researchers and clinicians. Combined with other sources of data, such as in situ physiological monitoring or behavioral observation via audio recordings, EMA will offer new opportunities linking self-reported experience to context. Finally, ecological momentary interventions are a promising development for clinical behavioral medicine, with its full potential and challenges yet to be fully explored.

N2  - Research on psychotherapeutic internet interventions started in the late 1990s and since then a considerable number of trials have shown that these interventions are effective in the treatment of depression. There is also no reason to assume that they are less effective than face-to-face treatments. This knowledge can be applied in most major areas of mental health care, including preventive services, primary care, specialized mental health care, and general medical care. Internet services can also be organised outside regular mental health care services because no personal contact with patients is needed. Internet interventions can build directly on the many new technological applications of the internet and mobile technology, through ecological momentary assessment and intervention, serious gaming, avatars and automatic emotion recognition, as well as smartwatches. This overview has made it clear that research in this area is booming and that there are many possibilities for all kinds of innovative interventions and applications.

T1  - Self-mananagement and demographic variables as predictors of obesity among adolescents.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2014//
N2  - The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of self-management on weight status among 350 adolescents in the state of North Carolina as part of an online intervention, employing the theory of self-management as a guiding framework. Using a linear regression analysis, the major finding was that there was a statistically significant relationship between self-management and change in BMI, such that each 1-point increase in self-management score on the SMI-C was associated with a .308 point reduction in BMI. It was further discovered that resilience did not moderate the relationship between self-management and BMI reduction and that overweight and obese subjects experienced statistically identical results. Finally, it was found that students who experienced higher levels of BMI reduction interacted more with the online tools provided as part of the intervention. The findings of the study established the legitimacy of using online interventions to combat obesity, thus providing support to schools and other public entities that wish to stage anti-obesity interventions but that lack the resources to do so in a more resource-intensive manner. As adolescent obesity is associated with a host of medical, psychological, social, and economic problems, the identification of an effective, low-cost means of BMI reduction has important social change implications. Schools and weight loss experts that can partner to deliver online services have the potential to reduce the currently epidemic levels of adolescent obesity in the United States. Reducing adolescent obesity levels can help to improve society by improving the physiological, psychological, and academic outcomes of students.

N2  - Background: Angina affects more than 50 million people worldwide. Secondary prevention interventions such as cardiac rehabilitation are not widely available for this population. An Internet-based version could offer a feasible alternative. Objective: Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of a Web-based cardiac rehabilitation program for those with angina. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial, recruiting those diagnosed with angina from general practitioners (GPs) in primary care to an intervention or control group. Intervention group participants were offered a 6-week Web-based rehabilitation program ("ActivateYourHeart"). The program was introduced during a face-to-face appointment and then delivered via the Internet (no further face-to-face contact). The program contained information about the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) and set each user goals around physical activity, diet, managing emotions, and smoking. Performance against goals was reviewed throughout the program and goals were then reset/modified. Participants completed an online exercise diary and communicated with rehabilitation specialists through an email link/synchronized chat room. Participants in the control group continued with GP treatment as usual, which consisted of being placed on a CHD register and attending an annual review. Outcomes were measured at 6-week and 6-month follow-ups during face-to-face assessments. The primary outcome measure was change in daily steps at 6 weeks, measured using an accelerometer. Secondary outcome measures were energy expenditure (EE), duration of sedentary activity (DSA), duration of moderate activity (DMA), weight, diastolic/systolic blood pressure, and body fat percentage. Self-assessed questionnaire outcomes included fat/fiber intake, anxiety/depression, self-efficacy, and quality of life (QOL). Results: A total of 94 participants were recruited and randomized to the intervention (n = 48) or the usual care (n = 46) group; 84 and 73 participants completed the 6-week and 6-month follow-ups, respectively. The mean number of log-ins to the program was 18.68 (SD 13.13, range 1-51), an average of 3 log-ins per week per participant. Change in daily steps walked at the 6-week follow-up was +497 (SD 2171) in the intervention group and -861 (SD 2534) in the control group (95% CI 263-2451, P = .02). Significant intervention effects were observed at the 6-week follow-up in EE (+43.94 kcal, 95% CI 43.93-309.98, P = .01), DSA (-7.79 minutes, 95% CI -55.01 to -7.01, P = .01), DMA (+6.31 minutes, 95% CI 6.01-51.20, P = .01), weight (-0.56 kg, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.15, P = .02), self-efficacy (95% CI 0.30-4.79, P = .03), emotional QOL score (95% CI 0.01-0.54, P = .04), and angina frequency (95% CI 8.57-35.05, P = .002). Significant benefits in angina frequency (95% CI 1.89-29.41, P = .02) and social QOL score (95% CI 0.05-0.54, P = .02) were also observed at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions: An Internet-based secondary prevention intervention could be offered to those with angina. A larger pragmatic trial is required to provide definitive evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Interest in the use of mobile technology to deliver mental-health services has grown in light of the economic and practical barriers to treatment. Yet research on alternative delivery strategies that are more affordable, accessible, and engaging is in its infancy. Attention-bias modification training (ABMT) has the potential to reduce treatment barriers as a mobile intervention for stress and anxiety, but the degree to which ABMT can be embedded in a mobile gaming format and its potential for transfer of benefits is unknown. In the present study, we examined effects of a gamified ABMT mobile application in highly trait-anxious participants (N = 78). A single session of the active training relative to the placebo training reduced subjective anxiety and observed stress reactivity. Critically, the long (45 min) but not the short (25 min) active training condition reduced the core cognitive process implicated in ABMT (threat bias) as measured by an untrained, gold-standard protocol.

N2  - Objective: Adaptive intensive interventions are introduced, and new methods from the field of control engineering for use in their design are illustrated. Method: A detailed step-by-step explanation of how control engineering methods can be used with intensive longitudinal data to design an adaptive intensive intervention is provided. The methods are evaluated via simulation. Results: Simulation results illustrate how the designed adaptive intensive intervention can result in improved outcomes with less treatment by providing treatment only when it is needed. Furthermore, the methods are robust to model misspecification as well as the influence of unobserved causes. Conclusions: These new methods can be used to design adaptive interventions that are effective yet reduce participant burden. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Comments on an article by D. C. Mohr et al. (see record 2014-34039-020). Mohr and colleagues recently presented an important paper describing an integrated conceptual and technological framework for eHealth and mHealth interventions, using existing models as their point of departure. They mentioned that the focus of existing psychological models on clinical outcomes instead of behavior is one of two limitations. However, behavior is a central element in both of the provided examples-the theory of planned behavior and the social cognitive theory. The second limitation was that "psychological models do not include critically important factors that can guide the design and specifications for a BIT (behavioral intervention technology)". The idea of describing a BIT model that supports the translation of intervention components into features is accepted with open arms. In sum, both the BIT model and IM address the limitations of existing models. Despite considerable overlap, they each have a unique contribution. Whereas IM stresses the importance of parameters for use, the BIT model focuses on the technical instantiation. The BIT model and IM are complementary, each with their own qualities. For example, when using IM, the BIT-Tech aspect of the BIT model is deemed useful in step 4. On the other hand, when using the BIT model, intervention developers should take the parameters for use from IM into account and report this in the research protocol. In my opinion, the unique contributions of both should be valued during the intervention development process. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Suicide-related behaviour among young people is of significant concern, yet little is known regarding the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce risk among this population. Of those interventions that have been tested, cognitive-behavioural therapy appears to show some promise among young people with suicidal ideation. Internet-based interventions are becoming increasingly popular and have shown some effect in preventing and treating depression and anxiety in young people. However, to date there are no randomised controlled trials examining the impact of Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy among suicidal youth. Methods/design: This is a randomised controlled trial testing the effects of Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy among suicidal high school students who have sought help from the school wellbeing team. The intervention comprises 8 modules of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy delivered online. The study has a staggered, two-year recruitment phase and participants are assessed at baseline, post intervention and 12 weeks later. Discussion: If effective the program has the ability to be readily adapted and delivered to a range of populations in a range of settings, at relatively little cost. It can also be adapted for mobile applications. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Nearly all college student smokers also drink alcohol, and smoking and heavy episodic drinking (HED) commonly co-occur. However, few studies have examined the factors that concurrently influence smoking and HED among college students and, to date, no interventions have been developed that target both HED and smoking in this population. The objective of the current study was to develop and evaluate a mobile feedback intervention that targets HED and smoking. Participants (N = 94) were non-treatment-seeking college students (Mage = 20.5 years, SD = 1.7) who engaged in at least a single HED episode in the past 2 weeks and reported concurrent smoking and drinking at least once a week. Participants were randomized to receive either the mobile intervention for 14 days, complete mobile assessments (without intervention) for 14 days, or complete minimal assessments (without intervention or mobile assessments). At a 1-month follow-up, compared with the minimal assessment condition, we observed significant reductions in the number of cigarettes per smoking day in both the mobile intervention (d = 0.55) and mobile assessment (d = 0.45) conditions. Among those randomized to the mobile intervention, receiving more modules of the intervention was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of any drinking during the 14-day assessment period and significant reductions in smoking at 1-month follow-up. The mobile intervention did not result in significant reductions in HED or concurrent smoking and drinking. Future research should continue to examine ways of using technology and the real-time environment to improve interventions for HED and smoking.

N2  - [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 17(4) of Journal of Medical Internet Research (see record 2016-32110-023). In the original article, the authors have inadvertently added the same image file for Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 has now been updated with the correct image, with the caption "I would like to open a message with Subject Line...".] Background: Computerized, Internet-delivered interventions can be efficacious; however, uptake and maintaining sustained client engagement are still big challenges. We see the development of effective engagement strategies as the next frontier in online health interventions, an area where much creative research has begun. We also argue that for engagement strategies to accomplish their purpose with novel targeted populations, they need to be tailored to such populations (ie, content is designed with the target population in mind). User-centered design frameworks provide a theoretical foundation for increasing user engagement and uptake by including users in development. However, deciding how to implement this approach to enage users in mental health intervention development is challenging. Objective: The aim of this study was to get user input and feedback on acceptability of messaging content intended to engage suicidal individuals. Methods: In March 2013, clinic intake staff distributed flyers announcing the study, "Your Feedback Counts" to potential participants (individuals waiting to be seen for a mental health appointment) together with the Patient Health Questionnaire. The flyer explained that a score of two or three ("more than half the days" or "nearly every day" respectively) on the suicide ideation question made them eligible to provide feedback on components of a suicide prevention intervention under development. The patient could access an anonymous online survey by following a link. After providing consent online, participants completed the anonymous survey. Results: Thirty-four individuals provided data on past demographic information. Participants reported that they would be most drawn to an intervention where they knew that they were cared about, that was personalized, that others like them had found it helpful, and that included examples with real people. Participants preferred email invitations with subject lines expressing concern and availability of extra resources. Participants also provided feedback about a media prototype including a brand design and advertisement video for introducing the intervention. Conclusions: This paper provides one model (including development of an engagement survey, audience for an engagement survey, methods for presenting results of an engagement survey) for including target users in the development of uptake strategies for online mental health interventions.

N2  - Background: Mobile technologies have wide-scale reach and disseminability, but no known studies have examined mobile technologies as a stand-alone tool to improve obesity-related behaviors of at-risk youth. Purpose: To test a 12-week mobile technology intervention for use and estimate effect sizes for a fully powered trial. Methods: Fifty-one low-income, racial/ethnic-minority girls aged 9-14 years were randomized to a mobile technology (n=26) or control (n=25) condition. Both conditions lasted 12 weeks and targeted fruits/vegetables (FVs; Weeks 1-4); sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; Weeks 5-8), and screen time (Weeks 9-12). The mobile intervention prompted real-time goal setting and self-monitoring and provided tips, feedback, and positive reinforcement related to the target behaviors. Controls received the same content in a written manual but no prompting. Outcomes included device utilization and effect size estimates of FVs, SSBs, screen time, and BMI. Data were collected and analyzed in 2011-2012. Results: Mobile technology girls used the program on 63% of days and exhibited trends toward increased FVs (+0.88, p=0.08) and decreased SSBs (-0.33, p=0.09). The adjusted difference between groups of 1.0 servings of FVs (p=0.13) and 0.35 servings of SSBs (p=0.25) indicated small to moderate effects of the intervention (Cohen's d=0.44 and -0.34, respectively). No differences were observed for screen time or BMI. Conclusions: A stand-alone mobile app may produce small to moderate effects for FVs and SSBs. Given the extensive reach of mobile devices, this pilot study demonstrates the need for larger-scale testing of similar programs to address obesity-related behaviors in high-risk youth.

T1  - Effects of a web-based decision aid on African American men's prostate screening knowledge and behavior.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - African American men have the highest prostate cancer occurrence and deaths of any population, yet many are unaware of screening opportunities or prognoses if diagnosed with the disease. The focus of this study was to learn whether a web-based prostate health education decision aid would increase prostate cancer knowledge, declared intention to be screened, and the likelihood of scheduling a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. The transtheoretical model of behavior change served as the theoretical framework for the study to assess readiness to adopt new behaviors. A total of 128 African American men between the ages of 40-65 without a history of prostate cancer participated in the study and were divided into 2 nonequivalent groups. The control group had 48 participants, and the intervention group had 80. After reviewing the web-based intervention, participants completed a demographic questionnaire, The Prostate Knowledge Questionnaire, and an Intent-to-Screen Tool. Mean differences in knowledge change were compared while adjusting for covariates using least squares regression. There was no significant improvement in the Prostate Knowledge Change score between the experimental and control groups. Therefore, the alternate hypothesis cannot be accepted. The social change implications suggest that the web-based decision aid studied in this project may not be the best tool to increase knowledge about prostate cancer screening. Therefore, more research is needed regarding ways to reach and inform African American men about the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening to foster informed decision making.

PT  - Dissertation Abstract
Y1  - 2013//
N2  - Technology has changed the way many operate within their profession. Psychologists have used technology for decades but often with caution. Due to the private nature of clinical practice, confidentiality and following ethical guidelines are imperative. As technology continues to rapidly alter the way people interact, the field of psychology is faced with many new ways to practice, teach, advertise, and supervise. This study explored the ways professionals view the use of technology in the psychological profession particularly in its relationship to risk and benefit to patient care. Professional and student members of the American Psychological Association were surveyed to explore their beliefs of risks and benefit to best patient care using advanced technologies. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview asking for input on a vignette of a fictitious psychologist who uses advanced technology such as internet therapy, video chat therapy via Skype, or other emerging technologies. Participants were more likely to consider using Smartphone technology than Second Life technology. Across all technologies assessed within this study, qualitative data analysis revealed increased access to psychological services and cost savings as the major benefits to using technology. The major concerns were ethical in nature, especially in regard to confidentiality and boundary concerns. Increased privacy, increased feelings of support, reduction of stigma, efficiency, and improved work quality were identified as possible benefits of technology while loss of intimacy and rapport, inadvertent promotion of pathology, safety concerns, loss of privacy, and technology failures were identified as risks. Implications for future research, clinical work, and professional regulation are offered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - Background: Managing Type 1 diabetes (T1D) during adolescence can be challenging, and there is a need for accessible interventions to help adolescents cope with diabetes-related stress. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare an Internet coping skills training (TEENCOPE) intervention to an Internet educational intervention (Managing Diabetes) for adolescents with T1D. Moderators of program efficacy were evaluated. Methods: The study was a multisite clinical trial (n = 320) with data collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Data were collected on the primary outcomes of physiologic (A1C) and psychosocial (quality of life) and on the secondary outcomes of behavioral (self-management) and psychosocial (stress, coping self-efficacy, social competence, family conflict) variables consistent with the conceptual framework. Data were analyzed using mixed-model analyses with an intent-to-treat approach. Results: There were no significant between-group treatment effects 6 months post-intervention on primary outcomes. The Managing Diabetes youth showed a significant increase in social competence compared to the TEENCOPE youth. There were significant time effects for TEENCOPE (decreased stress and increased coping) and Managing Diabetes (improved diabetes quality of life). Discussion: Youth with T1D transitioning to adolescence may need both structured diabetes education and coping skills to improve health outcomes. There may be a higher potential to reach adolescents with Type 1 diabetes of varying race and ethnicity via Internet interventions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

N2  - The digital environment (e.g. Internet, mobile phones, smart phones) that is now an integral part of our daily lives is becoming an increasingly important means of sustaining the health of people worldwide, whether by providing access to a wealth of information, by linking geographically dispersed communities of peers and professionals, or by supporting self-management of health and illness. As the papers in this issue illustrate, the Internet is therefore rapidly becoming both a medium and a focus for health psychology research. In terms of accessibility, it will be important to take into account large differences in digital skills and confidence, by ensuring that new digital interventions are friendly and appropriate to a wide range of users.
