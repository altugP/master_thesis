No other function in the supply chain is required to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week from New Year‚Äôs Day to New Year‚Äôs Eve‚Äîthere are no days off. That is why customers often take logistics for granted; they have come to expect that product delivery will be performed as promised.  It can be expensive and takes expertise. As these statistics indicate, the largest contributor to logistics cost is transportation: the movement of raw materials to a processing plant, parts to a manufacturer, and finished goods to wholesalers, retailers, and customers. But getting the goods from one point to another requires performing a number of other functions related to shipment. Goods need to be packaged, loaded, unloaded, warehoused, distributed, and paid for whenever they change hands. There are many examples of prosperous companies like the coca cola company, amazon that have correctly developed the supply change management concept and that enforce efficient practices.","['Java', 'Kotlin']"
