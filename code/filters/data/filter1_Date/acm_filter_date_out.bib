 abstract = {Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs) are characterized by the collective effort of heterogenous nodes called sensors and actors. Sensor nodes collect information about the physical world, while actor nodes take action decisions and perform appropriate actions upon the environment. The collaborative operation of sensors and actors brings significant advantages over traditional sensing, including improved accuracy, larger coverage area and timely actions upon the sensed phenomena. However, to realize these potential gains, there is a need for an efficient transport layer protocol that can address the unique communication challenges introduced by the coexistence of sensors and actors. In this paper, a Real-Time and Reliable Transport (RT)2 protocol is presented for WSANs. The objective of the (RT)2 protocol is to reliably and collaboratively transport event features from the sensor field to the actor nodes with minimum energy dissipation and to timely react to sensor information with a right action. In this respect, the (RT)2 protocol simultaneously addresses congestion control and timely event transport reliability objectives in WSANs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort focusing on real-time and reliable transport protocol for WSANs. Performance evaluations via simulation experiments show that the (RT)2 protocol achieves high performance in terms of reliable event detection, communication latency and energy consumption in WSANs.},

 abstract = {Current desktop operating systems use CPU utilization (or lack thereof) to prioritize processes for scheduling. This was thought to be beneficial for interactive processes, under the assumption that they spend much of their time waiting for user input. This reasoning fails for modern multimedia applications. For example, playing a movie in parallel with a heavy background job usually leads to poor graphical results, as these jobs are indistinguishable in terms of CPU usage. Suggested solutions involve shifting the burden to the user or programmer, which we claim is unsatisfactory; instead, we seek an automatic solution. Our attempts using new metrics based on CPU usage failed. We therefore propose and implement a novel scheme of identifying interactive and multimedia applications by directly quantifying the I/O between an application and the user (keyboard, mouse, and screen activity). Preliminary results indicate that prioritizing processes according to this metric indeed solves the aforementioned problem, demonstrating that operating systems can indeed provide better support for multimedia and interactive applications. Additionally, once user I/O data is available, it opens intriguing new possibilities to system designers.},

 abstract = {Public transportation systems are among the most ubiquitous and complex large-scale systems found in modern society. For those unable to drive such as people with cognitive disabilities, these systems are essential gateways for participation in community activities, socialization, and independence. To understand the magnitude and scope of this national problem, we highlight deficiencies identified in an international study by the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council and present specific cognitive barriers identified in empirical studies of transportation systems in several U.S. cities.An interdisciplinary team of HCI researchers, urban transportation planners, commercial technologists, and assistive care specialists are now collaborating on the Mobility-for-All project to create architectures and prototypes that support those with cognitive disabilities and their caregivers. We have grounded our research and design efforts using a distributed cognition framework. We have derived requirements for our designs by analyzing “how things are” for individuals with cognitive disabilities who learn and use public transportation systems. We present a socio-technical architecture that has three components: a) a personal travel assistant that uses real-time Global Positioning Systems data from the bus fleet to deliver just-in-time prompts; b) a mobile prompting client and a prompting script configuration tool for caregivers; and c) a monitoring system that collects real-time task status from the mobile client and alerts the support community of potential problems. We then describe a phased community-centered assessment approach that begins at the design stage and continues to be integrated throughout the project.This research has broad implications for designing more human-centered transportation systems that are universally accessible for other disenfranchised communities such as the elderly or nonnative speaker. This project presents an “in-the-world” research opportunity that challenges our understanding about mobile human computer interactions with ubiquitous, context-aware computing architectures in noisy, uncontrolled environments; personalization and user modeling techniques; and the design of universally accessible interfaces for complex systems through participatory design processes.This article provides both a near-term vision and an architecture for transportation systems that are socially inclusive, technologically appealing, and easier for everyone to use.},

 abstract = {The main goal of an Advanced Traffic Management System is to help human road managers to improve traffic flows and road safety. This goal turns out to be especially hard due to the difficulties in getting continuous traffic information and also because this information is distributed in several equipments belonging to different traffic administrations and offices. So, if a traffic administration detects a traffic incident, the traffic administration must decide whom, when, what and how to perform the control actions to deal with this incident. Current approaches to answer these questions are completely human based. We propose that a Multiagent System (MAS) is able to almost-automatically carry out the answers to these questions. In this paper it is exposed the main features of this MAS (its ontology, agents and interaction protocols) and the behavior exhibited by this MAS when a meteorological incident is detected by a traffic administration in a real traffic scenario, the A3 Spanish freeway.},

The characteristic of a multi-hop Real-Time Wireless Sensor Network raises new challenges. First, the constraints are more complicated and a new solution method is needed. Second, a distributed solution is needed to achieve scalability. This article presents solutions to both of the new challenges. The first solution to the optimal rate allocation is a centralized solution that can handle the more general form of constraints as compared with prior research. The second solution is a distributed version for large sensor networks using a pricing scheme. It is capable of incremental adjustment when utility functions change.

This report is one step in a participatory design process to develop a general framework for thinking about and teaching CRM.We introduce a novel sense-making structure for teaching CRM. That structure consists of a road map to the CRM literature, a framework grounded in questions rather than answers, and two CRM skill sets: core skills and specific skills. We integrate our structure with a model for the process a learner goes through on the way to becoming an expert computing researcher and offer example learning activities that represent a growing repository of course materials meant to aid those wishing to teach research skills to computing students.Our model is designed to ground discussion of teaching CRM and to serve as a roadmap for institutions, faculty, students and research communities addressing the transition from student to fully enfranchised member of a computing research community of practice. To that end, we offer several possible scenarios for using our model.In computing, research methods have traditionally been passed from advisor to student via apprenticeship. Establishing a richer pedagogy for training researchers in computing will benefit all (see Figure 1).},

However, ad hoc networks are not yet ready for large-scale deployment, because several unsolved research challenges persist. Evaluation methods such as analytical modeling, simulation, emulation, and real-world experiments aid in addressing these challenges. Applying a single method alone often leaves doubt as to the accuracy of the obtained results. Thus, there is a strong need for tools that support the task of modeling, evaluation, and analysis. These tools should allow for protocol validation, performance analysis, and proof-of-concept implementation using multiple evaluation methods.

We show that by reserving disk resources in terms of utilization it is possible to create a disk scheduler that supports reservation of nearly 100% of the disk resources, provides arbitrarily hard or soft guarantees depending upon application needs, and yields efficiency as good or better than best-effort disk schedulers tuned for performance.

 abstract = {We present the Meeting Mediator (MM), a real-time portable system that detects social interactions and provides persuasive feedback to enhance group collaboration. Social interactions is captured using Sociometric badges [17] and are visualized on mobile phones to promote behavioral change. Particularly in distributed collaborations, MM attempts to bridge the gap among the distributed groups by detecting and communicating social signals. In a study on brainstorming and problem solving meetings, MM had a significant effect on overlapping speaking time and interactivity level without distracting the subjects. The Sociometric badges were also able to detect dominant players in the group and measure their influence on other participants. Most interestingly, in groups with one or more dominant people, MM effectively reduced the dynamical difference between co-located and distributed collaboration as well as the behavioral difference between dominant and non-dominant people. Our system encourages change in group dynamics that may lead to higher performance and satisfaction. We envision that MM will be deployed in real-world organizations to improve interactions across various group collaboration contexts.},

 abstract = {Software evolution is a challenging issue. For example, how do we judge whether one kind of structure supports evolution better than another kind of structure without comparing them in a fairly controlled way? In this paper we claim that certain aspects of software evolution should be evaluated in controlled experiments with first students, and then professionals, as subjects. Although we may have to compromise on longevity (due to enormous costs), we may observe cause-effect relationships in experiments that cannot be identified in case studies. We describe various challenges of conducting such experiments. We illustrate these issues by a controlled experiment on changeability decay conducted with students and a planned, more realistic extension with mostly software professionals as subjects.},

 abstract = {With NSF support we developed a hands-on laboratory to augment our CS453 Electronic Commerce Technologies course. We conducted weekly lab sessions that covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Perl, CGI, SQL, ASP, and Flash programming. Each topic was covered over a period of one to three weeks and each topic was supported by 10 to 26 individual programming exercises. Four teaching assistants provided real-time support during the laboratory period. Answers to all exercises were accessible on-line so that no student would be needlessly delayed by any particular problem. In this paper we discuss the laboratory's design goals, topical content, and the students' performance, reactions, and suggestions for improvement.},

 abstract = {Studies suggest that when the goal is to help students develop their abilities, feedback should not be presented along with an overall grade. The effectiveness of feedback will depend on features of its quality. We describe guidelines for giving effective feedback including giving overall grades, levels and functions of feedback, and practices in effective feedback. The guidelines are based on a review of research of feedback on writing as well as general theories of feedback. We learned that in order for students to benefit from feedback, they have to (1) notice it, (2) accept it, and (3) understand what to do with it. After reviewing the research, we end with recommendations that support these notions.},
