 abstract = {Background: The Internet is increasingly used as a medium for the
delivery of interventions designed to promote health behavior change.
However, reviews of these interventions to date have not systematically
identified intervention characteristics and linked these to
effectiveness.
Objectives: The present review sought to capitalize on recently
published coding frames for assessing use of theory and behavior change
techniques to investigate which characteristics of Internet-based
interventions best promote health behavior change. In addition, we
wanted to develop a novel coding scheme for assessing mode of delivery
in Internet-based interventions and also to link different modes to
effect sizes.
Methods: We conducted a computerized search of the databases indexed by
ISI Web of Knowledge (including BIOSIS Previews and Medline) between
2000 and 2008. Studies were included if (1) the primary components of
the intervention were delivered via the Internet, (2) participants were
randomly assigned to conditions, and (3) a measure of behavior related
to health was taken after the intervention.
Results: We found 85 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria,
providing a total sample size of 43,236 participants. On average,
interventions had a statistically small but significant effect on
health-related behavior (d(+) = 0.16, 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.23). More
extensive use of theory was associated with increases in effect size (P
= .049), and, in particular, interventions based on the theory of
planned behavior tended to have substantial effects on behavior (d(+) =
0.36, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.56). Interventions that incorporated more
behavior change techniques also tended to have larger effects compared
to interventions that incorporated fewer techniques (P < .001). Finally,
the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions was enhanced by the
use of additional methods of communicating with participants, especially
the use of short message service (SMS), or text, messages.
Conclusions: The review provides a framework for the development of a
science of Internet-based interventions, and our findings provide a
rationale for investing in more intensive theory-based interventions
that incorporate multiple behavior change techniques and modes of
delivery.},

 abstract = {Background: Researchers and practitioners have developed numerous online
interventions that encourage people to reduce their drinking, increase
their exercise, and better manage their weight. Motivations to develop
eHealth interventions may be driven by the Internet's reach,
interactivity, cost-effectiveness, and studies that show online
interventions work. However, when designing online interventions
suitable for public campaigns, there are few evidence-based guidelines,
taxonomies are difficult to apply, many studies lack impact data, and
prior meta-analyses are not applicable to large-scale public campaigns
targeting voluntary behavioral change.
Objectives: This meta-analysis assessed online intervention design
features in order to inform the development of online campaigns, such as
those employed by social marketers, that seek to encourage voluntary
health behavior change. A further objective was to increase
understanding of the relationships between intervention adherence, study
adherence, and behavioral outcomes.
Methods: Drawing on systematic review methods, a combination of 84 query
terms were used in 5 bibliographic databases with additional gray
literature searches. This resulted in 1271 abstracts and papers; 31 met
the inclusion criteria. In total, 29 papers describing 30 interventions
were included in the primary meta-analysis, with the 2 additional
studies qualifying for the adherence analysis. Using a random effects
model, the first analysis estimated the overall effect size, including
groupings by control conditions and time factors. The second analysis
assessed the impacts of psychological design features that were coded
with taxonomies from evidence-based behavioral medicine, persuasive
technology, and other behavioral influence fields. These separate
systems were integrated into a coding framework model called the
communication-based influence components model. Finally, the third
analysis assessed the relationships between intervention adherence and
behavioral outcomes.
Results: The overall impact of online interventions across all studies
was small but statistically significant (standardized mean difference
effect size d = 0.19, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.11-0.28,
P<.001, number of interventions k = 30). The largest impact with a
moderate level of efficacy was exerted from online interventions when
compared with waitlists and placebos (d = 0.28, 95\% CI = 0.17-0.39,
P<.001, k = 18), followed by comparison with lower-tech online
interventions (d = 0.16, 95\% CI = 0.00-0.32, P=.04, k = 8); no
significant difference was found when compared with sophisticated print
interventions (d = -0.11, 95\% CI = -0.34 to 0.12, P = .35, k = 4),
though online interventions offer a small effect with the advantage of
lower costs and larger reach. Time proved to be a critical factor, with
shorter interventions generally achieving larger impacts and greater
adherence. For psychological design, most interventions drew from the
transtheoretical approach and were goal orientated, deploying numerous
influence components aimed at showing users the consequences of their
behavior, assisting them in reaching goals, and providing normative
pressure. Inconclusive results suggest a relationship between the number
of influence components and intervention efficacy. Despite one
contradictory correlation, the evidence suggests that study adherence,
intervention adherence, and behavioral outcomes are correlated.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that online interventions have
the capacity to influence voluntary behaviors, such as those routinely
targeted by social marketing campaigns. Given the high reach and low
cost of online technologies, the stage may be set for increased public
health campaigns that blend interpersonal online systems with mass-media
outreach. Such a combination of approaches could help individuals
achieve personal goals that, at an individual level, help citizens
improve the quality of their lives and at a state level, contribute to
healthier societies.},

@article{WOS:000310148500001,
 abstract = {Background: Given that patients provide the majority of their own
diabetes care, patient self-management training has increasingly become
recognized as an important strategy with which to improve quality of
care. However, participation in self management programs is low. In
addition, the efficacy of current behavioural interventions wanes over
time, reducing the impact of self-management interventions on patient
health. Web-based interventions have the potential to bridge the gaps in
diabetes care and self-management.
Methods: Our objective is to improve self-efficacy, quality of life,
self-care, blood pressure, cholesterol and glycemic control and promote
exercise in people with type 2 diabetes through the rigorous development
and use of a web-based patient self-management intervention. This study
consists of five phases: (1) intervention development; (2) feasibility
testing; (3) usability testing; (4) intervention refinement; and (5)
intervention evaluation using mixed methods. We will employ
evidence-based strategies and tools, using a theoretical framework of
self-efficacy, then elicit user feedback through focus groups and
individual user testing sessions. Using iterative redesign the
intervention will be refined. Once finalized, the impact of the website
on patient self-efficacy, quality of life, self-care, HbA1c,
LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure and weight will be assessed through a
non-randomized observational cohort study using repeated measures
modeling and individual interviews.
Discussion: Increasing use of the World Wide Web by consumers for health
information and ongoing revolutions in social media are strong
indicators that users are primed to welcome a new era of technology in
health care. However, their full potential is hindered by limited
knowledge regarding their effectiveness, poor usability, and high
attrition rates. Our development and research agenda aims to address
these limitations by improving usability, identifying characteristics
associated with website use and attrition, and developing strategies to
sustain patient use in order to maximize clinical outcomes.},

 abstract = {Background: A wide range of self-directed weight-loss interventions are
available, providing users with a variety of tools delivered through
various formats to regulate weight-related behavior patterns. However,
it is unclear how effective self-directed interventions are and how they
promote weight loss and weight maintenance.
Objective: A systematic review of reviews was conducted to examine the
effectiveness of such interventions and to identify intervention content
associated with effectiveness.
Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library for
systematic reviews were searched from 2000-2012 for reviews of the
effectiveness of self-directed interventions on weight loss and weight
maintenance in adults. Two reviewers used predefined inclusion criteria
to select relevant reviews and assess their quality using the Overview
Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ). We extracted data on
effectiveness and on relationships between intervention characteristics
and effectiveness.
Results: Twenty reviews were included and quality assessed. Findings
relevant to self-directed interventions, including interactive websites,
smartphone applications, and text messaging (short message service, SMS)
were summarized. Findings were mixed but promising. For example, one
review of Internet-based interventions found that, when used in
conjunction with standard weight loss programs, these interventions
resulted in a significant average increase in weight loss of 1.5 kg over
evaluation periods. Unfortunately, only 7 of 20 reviews were of high
methodological quality according to OQAQ scores, and only 4 employed
meta-analyses. Few reviews linked intervention content to effectiveness.
Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that self-directed interventions
can independently promote weight loss and can augment interventions
involving personal contact. Particular change techniques and delivery
modes including individualized feedback, email counseling, and online
social support appear to enhance effectiveness. Further reviews of the
content of self-directed weight-loss intervention studies are needed to
clarify which change techniques delivered through which delivery formats
optimize intervention effectiveness.},

 abstract = {Background: The high prevalence rate of asthma represents a major
societal burden. Advancements in information technology continue to
affect the delivery of patient care in all areas of medicine.
Internet-based solutions, social media, and mobile technology could
address some of the problems associated with increasing asthma
prevalence.
Objective: This review evaluates Internet-based asthma interventions
that were published between 2004 and October 2014 with respect to the
use of behavioral change theoretical frameworks, applied clinical
guidelines, and assessment tools.
Methods: The search term (Asthma AND {[}Online or Internet or Mobile or
Application or eHealth or App]) was applied to six bibliographic
databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, BioMed Central, ProQuest Computing, Web
of Knowledge, and ACM Digital Library) including only English-language
articles published between 2004 and October 2014. In total, 3932
articles matched the priori search terms and were reviewed by the
primary reviewer based on their titles, index terms, and abstracts. The
matching articles were then screened by the primary reviewer for
inclusion or exclusion based on their abstract, study type, and
intervention objectives with respect to the full set of priori inclusion
and exclusion criteria; 331 duplicates were identified and removed. A
total of 85 articles were included for in-depth review and the remaining
3516 articles were excluded. The primary and secondary reviewer
independently reviewed the complete content of the 85 included articles
to identify the applied behavioral change theories, clinical guidelines,
and assessment tools. Findings and any disagreement between reviewers
were resolved by in-depth discussion and through a consolidation process
for each of the included articles.
Results: The reviewers identified 17 out of 85 interventions (20\%)
where at least one model, framework, and/ or construct of a behavioral
change theory were applied. The review identified six clinical
guidelines that were applied across 30 of the 85 interventions (35\%) as
well as a total of 21 assessment tools that were applied across 32 of
the 85 interventions (38\%).
Conclusions: The findings of this literature review indicate that the
majority of published Internet-based interventions do not use any
documented behavioral change theory, clinical guidelines, and/ or
assessment tools to inform their design. Further, it was found that the
application of clinical guidelines and assessment tools were more
salient across the reviewed interventions. A consequence, as such, is
that many Internet-based asthma interventions are designed in an ad hoc
manner, without the use of any notable evidence-based theoretical
frameworks, clinical guidelines, and/ or assessment tools.},

 abstract = {Online health information tools (OHITs) have been found to be effective
in improving health outcomes. However, the effectiveness of these tools
for older patients has been far from clear. This systematic literature
review therefore provides an overview of online health information tool
effectiveness for older patients using a two-dimensional framework of
OHIT functions (i.e., providing information, enhancing information
exchange, and promoting self-management) and outcomes (i.e., immediate,
intermediate, and long-term outcomes). Comprehensive searches of the
PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases are conducted to identify
eligible studies. Articles describing outcomes of patient-directed OHITs
in which a mean sample or subgroup of age >= 65 years was used are
included in the literature review. A best evidence synthesis analysis
provides evidence that OHITs improve self-efficacy, blood pressure,
hemoglobin levels, and cholesterol levels. Limited evidence is found in
support of OHIT effects on knowledge, perceived social support, health
service utilization, glycemic control, self-care adherence, exercise
performance, endurance, and quality of life. OHITs seem promising tools
to facilitate immediate, intermediate, and long-term outcomes in older
patients by providing information, enhancing information exchange, and
promoting self-management. However, future studies should evaluate the
effectiveness of OHITs for older patients to achieve stronger levels of
evidence.},

@article{WOS:000360306600001,
 abstract = {Background: With continued increases in smartphone ownership,
researchers and clinicians are investigating the use of this technology
to enhance the management of chronic illnesses such as bipolar disorder
(BD). Smartphones can be used to deliver interventions and
psychoeducation, supplement treatment, and enhance therapeutic reach in
BD, as apps are cost-effective, accessible, anonymous, and convenient.
While the evidence-based development of BD apps is in its infancy, there
has been an explosion of publicly available apps. However, the
opportunity for mHealth to assist in the self-management of BD is only
feasible if apps are of appropriate quality.
Objective: Our aim was to identify the types of apps currently available
for BD in the Google Play and iOS stores and to assess their features
and the quality of their content.
Methods: A systematic review framework was applied to the search,
screening, and assessment of apps. We searched the Australian Google
Play and iOS stores for English-language apps developed for people with
BD. The comprehensiveness and quality of information was assessed
against core psychoeducation principles and current BD treatment
guidelines. Management tools were evaluated with reference to the
best-practice resources for the specific area. General app features, and
privacy and security were also assessed.
Results: Of the 571 apps identified, 82 were included in the review. Of
these, 32 apps provided information and the remaining 50 were management
tools including screening and assessment (n=10), symptom monitoring
(n=35), community support (n=4), and treatment (n=1). Not even a quarter
of apps (18/82, 22\%) addressed privacy and security by providing a
privacy policy. Overall, apps providing information covered a third
(4/11, 36\%) of the core psychoeducation principles and even fewer
(2/13, 15\%) best-practice guidelines. Only a third (10/32, 31\%) cited
their information source. Neither comprehensiveness of psychoeducation
information (r=-.11, P=.80) nor adherence to best-practice guidelines
(r=-.02, P=.96) were significantly correlated with average user ratings.
Symptom monitoring apps generally failed to monitor critical information
such as medication (20/35, 57\%) and sleep (18/35, 51\%), and the
majority of self-assessment apps did not use validated screening
measures (6/10, 60\%).
Conclusions: In general, the content of currently available apps for BD
is not in line with practice guidelines or established self-management
principles. Apps also fail to provide important information to help
users assess their quality, with most lacking source citation and a
privacy policy. Therefore, both consumers and clinicians should exercise
caution with app selection. While mHealth offers great opportunities for
the development of quality evidence-based mobile interventions, new
frameworks for mobile mental health research are needed to ensure the
timely availability of evidence-based apps to the public.},

 abstract = {Objective:To synthesize the evidence for using interactive digital
interventions (IDIs) to support patient self-management of hypertension,
and to determine their impact on control and reduction of blood
pressure.Method:Systematic review with meta-analysis was undertaken with
a search performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane
Library, DoPHER, TROPHI, Social Science Citation Index and Science
Citation Index. The population was adults (>18 years) with hypertension,
intervention was an IDI and the comparator was usual care. Primary
outcomes were change in SBP and DBP. Only randomized controlled trials
and studies published in journals and in English were eligible. Eligible
IDIs included interventions accessed through a computer, smartphone or
other hand-held device.Results:Four out of seven studies showed a
significantly greater reduction for intervention compared to usual care
for SBP, with no difference found for three. Overall, IDIs significantly
reduced SBP, with the weighted mean difference being -3.74mmHg {[}95\%
confidence interval (CI) -2.19 to -2.58] with no heterogeneity observed
(I-squared=0.0\%, P=0.990). For DBP, four out of six studies indicated a
greater reduction for intervention compared to controls, with no
difference found for two. For DBP, a significant reduction of -2.37mmHg
(95\% CI -0.40 to -4.35) was found, but considerable heterogeneity was
noted (I-squared=80.1\%, P=<0.001).Conclusion:IDIs lower both SBP and
DBP compared to usual care. Results suggest these findings can be
applied to a wide range of healthcare systems and populations. However,
sustainability and long-term clinical effectiveness of these
interventions remain uncertain.},

@article{WOS:000374557000002,
 abstract = {Background: Internet-based interventions are seen as an important
potential strategy to improve accessibility and affordability of high
quality treatments in mental healthcare. A growing number of studies
have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of internet-based treatment for
mood disorders, but scientific evidence for the application in routine
specialised mental healthcare settings is limited. Also, little is known
about the clinical and health-economic benefits of blended treatment,
where online interventions are integrated with face-to-face treatment of
depression in one treatment protocol. The primary aim of this study is
to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of blended Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy (bCBT) for depression, as compared to treatment as
usual (TAU) in specialised routine mental healthcare in the Netherlands.
This trial is part of the E-COMPARED project which has a broader
perspective, focussing on primary and specialised care in eight European
countries.
Method/Design: The study is a randomised controlled non-inferiority
trial with two parallel conditions: bCBT and TAU. The blended treatment
combines individual face-to-face CBT with CBT delivered through an
Internet-based treatment platform (Moodbuster). This platform includes a
mobile phone application, used for ecological momentary assessments,
automated feedback and motivational messages. Weekly alternating
face-to-face (10) and online (9) sessions will be delivered over a
period of 19-20 weeks. TAU is defined as the routine care that subjects
receive when they are diagnosed with depression in specialised mental
healthcare. Adult patients >= 18 years old meeting DSM-IV diagnostic
criteria for major depressive disorder will be recruited within
participating outpatient specialised mental healthcare clinics in the
Netherlands. Measurements will be taken at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12
months follow-up. The primary outcome will be depressive symptoms,
measured with the PHQ-9 and QIDS. Secondary outcomes include
health-related quality of life, mastery, treatment preference, working
alliance, system usability, treatment satisfaction and possible negative
side-effects. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted
from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect
healthcare costs.
Discussion: The results of this study will provide insight into the
health and economical outcomes of blended treatment for depression and
give an indication of the value of implementing blended treatment in
specialised clinical settings.},

 abstract = {Background: Promoting physical activity and healthy eating is important
to combat the unprecedented rise in NCDs in many developing countries.
Using modern information-and communication technologies to deliver
physical activity and diet interventions is particularly promising
considering the increased proliferation of such technologies in many
developing countries. The objective of this systematic review is to
investigate the effectiveness of e-\& mHealth interventions to promote
physical activity and healthy diets in developing countries.
Methods: Major databases and grey literature sources were searched to
retrieve studies that quantitatively examined the effectiveness of e-\&
mHealth interventions on physical activity and diet outcomes in
developing countries. Additional studies were retrieved through citation
alerts and scientific social media allowing study inclusion until August
2016. The CONSORT checklist was used to assess the risk of bias of the
included studies.
Results: A total of 15 studies conducted in 13 developing countries in
Europe, Africa, Latin-and South America and Asia were included in the
review. The majority of studies enrolled adults who were healthy or at
risk of diabetes or hypertension. The average intervention length was
6.4 months, and text messages and the Internet were the most frequently
used intervention delivery channels. Risk of bias across the studies was
moderate (55.7 \% of the criteria fulfilled). Eleven studies reported
significant positive effects of an e-\& mHealth intervention on physical
activity and/or diet behaviour. Respectively, 50 \% and 70 \% of the
interventions were effective in promoting physical activity and healthy
diets.
Conclusions: The majority of studies demonstrated that e-\& mHealth
interventions were effective in promoting physical activity and healthy
diets in developing countries. Future interventions should use more
rigorous study designs, investigate the cost-effectiveness and reach of
interventions, and focus on emerging technologies, such as smart phone
apps and wearable activity trackers.},

 abstract = {Background: First-episode psychosis most often has its onset during late
adolescence. In caring for the young person, families endure high levels
of stress and depression. Meanwhile, the social networks of families
often erode. Our group has previously shown that family cognitive
behaviour therapy (CBT) leads to significantly improved perceived stress
compared with specialist first-episode treatment as usual; however,
there are well-known barriers to the dissemination of effective family
interventions. To address this, we have developed a novel online
intervention entitled `Altitudes' that fully integrates purpose-built
online social networking, expert and peer moderation, and evidence-based
psychoeducation within a single application. The primary aim of this
trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of Altitudes in reducing stress
in carers over a 6-month period.
Methods/design: We describe here a single-blinded cluster randomised
controlled trial (cRCT) with permutated blocks. The clusters comprise
individual families. The two treatment conditions include Altitudes plus
Specialist Treatment as Usual (STAU) and STAU alone. Altitudes involves
participation in our novel online programme whereas STAU comprises
specialist family work at the Early Psychosis Prevention and
Intervention Centre (EPPIC), Melbourne, Australia. We aim to recruit 160
family members of young, 15-27 year-old, patients registered for
treatment for first-episode psychosis (FEP) at EPPIC. The design
includes two assessment time points, namely, baseline and 6-month
follow-up. The study is due for completion within 2 years including an
18-month recruitment period and a 6-month treatment phase. The primary
outcome is carers' perceived stress at 6 months. Secondary outcome
measures include a biomarker of stress, depressive symptoms, worry,
substance use, loneliness, social support, satisfaction with life, and a
range of measures that tap into coping resources. We seek to gain a
dynamic picture of carer stress through our Smartphone Ecological
Momentary Assessment (SEMA) tool.
Discussion: This is the first randomised controlled trial designed to
evaluate an online intervention for carers of young people recovering
from FEP. It has the potential to produce evidence in support of a
highly novel, accessible, and cost-effective intervention to reduce
stress in carers who are providing support to young people at a critical
phase in their recovery from psychosis.},

 abstract = {Background: The Internet is transforming mental health care services by
increasing access to, and potentially improving the quality of, care.
Internet-based interventions in mental health can potentially play a
role in transitions from biomedical to recovery-oriented research and
practices, but an overview of what this may entail, current work, and
issues that need addressing, is lacking. The objective of this study is
to describe Internet-based recoveryoriented interventions (referred to
as e-recovery) and current research, and to identify gaps and issues
relevant to advancing recovery research and practices through
opportunities provided by the Internet.
Methods: Five iterative stages of a scoping review framework were
followed in searching and analyzing the literature. A recovery framework
with four domains and 16 themes was used to deductively code
intervention characteristics according to their support for
recovery-oriented practices. Only Internet-based interventions used in
conjunction with ongoing care were included.
Results: Twenty studies describing six e-recovery interventions were
identified and originated in Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway
and USA. The domain supporting personal recovery was most clearly
reflected in interventions, whereas the last three domains, i.e.,
promoting citizenship, organizational commitment and working
relationship were less evident. Support for the formulation and
follow-up of personal goals and preferences, and in accessing
peer-support, were the characteristics shared by most interventions.
Three of the six studies that employed a comparison group used
randomization, and none presented definitive findings. None used
recoveryoriented frameworks or specific recovery outcome measures. Four
of the interventions were specific to a diagnosis.
Conclusion: Research about how technologies might aid in illuminating
and shaping recovery processes is in its formative stages. We recommend
that future e-recovery research and innovation attend to four
dimensions: evidence-supported interventions, new knowledge about
personal recovery, values-based approaches and Internet as a facilitator
for organizational transformation. The incremental changes facilitated
by e-recovery may help propel a shift in mental health care toward
recovery-oriented practices.},

 abstract = {Background: The initial introduction of the World Wide Web in 1990
brought around the biggest change in information acquisition. Due to the
abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the
utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic. A
substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily
available to download concerning a wide range of health issues. mHealth
has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments; eradicate
the need to meet in person with a clinician, successively diminishing
the workload of mental health professionals; be more cost effective to
practices; and encourage self-care tactics. Previous research has given
valid evidence with empirical studies proving the effectiveness of
physical and mental health interventions using mobile apps. Alongside
apps, there is evidence to show that receiving short message service
(SMS) messages, which entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and
links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a
patient's mental and physical well-being. Available mHealth apps and SMS
services and their ever improving quality necessitates a systematic
review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence
to intervention, and usability.
Objective: The aim of this review was to study the efficacy, usability,
and feasibility of mobile apps and SMS messages as mHealth interventions
for self-guided care.
Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in JMIR, PubMed,
PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and SAGE. The search
spanned from January 2008 to January 2017. The primary outcome measures
consisted of weight management, (pregnancy) smoking cessation,
medication adherence, depression, anxiety and stress. Where possible,
adherence, feasibility, and usability outcomes of the apps or SMS
services were evaluated. Between-group and within-group effect sizes
(Cohen d) for the mHealth intervention method group were determined.
Results: A total of 27 studies, inclusive of 4658 participants were
reviewed. The papers included randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
(n=19), within-group studies (n=7), and 1 within-group study with
qualitative aspect. Studies show improvement in physical health and
significant reductions of anxiety, stress, and depression. Within-group
and between-group effect sizes ranged from 0.05-3.37 (immediately
posttest), 0.05-3.25 (1-month follow-up), 0.08-3.08 (2-month follow-up),
0.00-3.10 (3-month follow-up), and 0.02-0.27 (6-month follow-up).
Usability and feasibility of mHealth interventions, where reported, also
gave promising, significant results.
Conclusions: The review shows the promising and emerging efficacy of
using mobile apps and SMS text messaging as mHealth interventions.},

 abstract = {Introduction Peer support is receiving increasing attention as both an
effective and cost-effective intervention method to support the
self-management of chronic health conditions. Given that an increasing
proportion of Canadians have internet access and the increasing
implementation of web-based interventions, online peer support
interventions are a promising option to address the burden of chronic
diseases. Thus, the specific research question of this scoping review is
the following: What is known from the existing literature about the key
characteristics of online peer support interventions for adults with
chronic conditions?
Methods and analysis We will use the methodological frameworks used by
Arksey and O'Malley as well as Levac and colleagues for the current
scoping review. To be eligible for inclusion, studies must report on
adults (>= 18 years of age) with one of the Public Health Agency of
Canada chronic conditions or HIV/AIDS. We will limit our review to peer
support interventions delivered through online formats. All study
designs will be included. Only studies published from 2012 onwards will
be included to ensure relevance to the current healthcare context and
feasibility. Furthermore, only English language studies will be
included. Studies will be identified by searching a variety of
databases. Two reviewers will independently screen the titles and
abstracts identified by the literature search for inclusion (ie, level 1
screening), the full text articles (ie, level 2 screening) and then
perform data abstraction. Abstracted data will include study
characteristics, participant population, key characteristics of the
intervention and outcomes collected.
Dissemination This review will identify the key features of online peer
support interventions and could assist in the future development of
other online peer support programmes so that effective and sustainable
programmes can be developed.},

 abstract = {Objective: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ecological
momentary intervention (EMI) are technologies used to track fluctuations
in experiences and prompt behavioral responses within the context of a
person's daily life. Most commonly delivered via smartphone, EMA and EMI
have potential to provide simple, cost-effective, and user led treatment
for psychotic disorders. This systematic review aimed to synthesize
current research exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical
outcomes of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic disorders.
Methods: A systematic search was conducted identifying studies published
between 1980 and July 7, 2016, by searching PubMed, PsycINFO,
PsycARTICLES, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
with combinations of search terms related to mobile devices, EMA and
EMI, and psychotic disorders.
Results: Of 1,623 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for
the review. These studies found satisfactory feasibility and
acceptability and preliminary evidence of improved clinical outcomes.
The interventions, which had a broad array of features, targeted remote
monitoring of illness and symptoms, and they also targeted illness
self-management by using momentary reminders or instructions for
behaviors, including medication adherence, management of symptoms and
psycho social impairments, daily living skills, and goal achievement,
Conclusions: The findings of this review provide preliminary support for
the clinical utility of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic
disorders. Future research should explore further applications of these
technologies with larger sample sizes and controlled designs.},

 abstract = {Background: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the first-line of
treatment for overweight and obesity patients whose problems originate
in maladaptive eating habits (e.g., emotional eating). However,
in-person CBT is currently difficult to access by large segments of the
population. The proposed SIGMA intervention (i.e., the Self-help,
Integrated, and Gamified Mobile-phone Application) is a mHealth
intervention based on CBT principles. It specifically targets overweight
young adults with underlying maladaptive behaviors and cognitions
regarding food. The SIGMA app was designed as a serious game and
intended to work as a standalone app for weight maintenance or alongside
a calorie-restrictive diet for weight loss. It uses a complex and novel
scoring system that allows points earned within the game to be
supplemented by points earned during outdoor activities with the help of
an embedded pedometer.
Methods/design: The efficacy of the SIGMA mHealth intervention will be
investigated within a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The
intervention will be set to last 2 months with a 3-month follow-up.
Selected participants will be young overweight adults with non-clinical
maladaptive eating habits embodied by food cravings, binge eating, and
emotional eating. The primary outcomes will be represented by changes in
(1) self-reported maladaptive thoughts related to eating and body
weight, (2) self-reported maladaptive eating behaviors in the range of
urgent food cravings, emotional eating or binge eating, (3) as well as
biased attentional processing of food items as indexed by reaction
times. Secondary outcomes will be represented by changes in weight, Body
Mass Index, general mood, and physical activity as indexed by the number
of steps per day.
Discussion: Through an evidence-based cognitive behavioral approach and
a user-friendly game interface, the SIGMA intervention offers a
significant contribution to the development of a cost-effective and
preventive self-help tool for young overweight adults with maladaptive
eating habits.},

 abstract = {Background: Evidence shows that internet-based self-help interventions
are effective in reducing symptoms for a wide range of mental disorders.
To date, online interventions treating psychotic disorders have been
scarce, even though psychosis is among the most burdensome disorders
worldwide. Furthermore, the implementation of cognitive-behavioral
therapy (CBT) for psychosis in routine health care is challenging.
Internet-based interventions could narrow this treatment gap. Thus, a
comprehensive CBT-based online self-help intervention for people with
psychosis has been developed. The aim of this study is the evaluation of
the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention compared with a waiting
list control group.
Methods: The intervention includes modules on delusion, voice hearing,
social competence, mindfulness, and seven other domains. Participants
are guided through the program by a personal moderator. Usage can be
amended by an optional smartphone app. In this randomized controlled
trial, participants are allocated to a waiting list or an intervention
of eight weeks. Change in positive psychotic symptoms of both groups
will be compared (primary outcome) and predictors of treatment effects
will be assessed.
Discussion: To our knowledge, this project is one of the first
large-scale investigations of an internet-based intervention for people
with psychosis. It may thus be a further step to broaden treatment
options for people suffering from this disorder.},

 abstract = {Background: The clinical utility of the existing apps for people with
eating disorders (EDs) is not clear. The TCApp has been specifically
developed for people with EDs, is based on the principles of Cognitive
Behavioural Treatment (CBT) and allows a bidirectional link between the
patient and the therapist. The objectives of the study are, first, to
assess the clinical efficacy of a combined intervention for Eating
Disorders (EDs) that includes an online intervention through the TCApp
plus standard face-to-face CBT in comparison to standard face-to-face
CBT alone, and second, to examine the cost-effectiveness of the TCApp
and identify potential predicting, moderating and mediating variables
that promote or hinder the implementation of the TCApp in ED units in
Spain.
Methods: The study methodology is that of a randomised controlled trial
combining qualitative and quantitative methods, with a 6-month
follow-up. Approximately 250 patients over 12 years old with a diagnosis
of an ED from several ED units in Spain will be randomised to one of two
different conditions. Participants, their caregivers, healthcare
professionals and technical staff involved in the development and
maintenance of the application will be assessed at baseline (T0),
post-intervention (T1) and at 6 months follow-up (T2). Primary outcome
measures will include ED symptomatology while secondary measures will
include general psychopathology and quality of life for patients,
quality of life and caregiving experience for family caregivers and
adoption-related variables for all participants involved, such as
perceived usability, user's satisfaction and technology acceptance. For
the cost-effectiveness analysis, we will assess quality-adjusted life
years (QALYs); total societal cost will be estimated using costs to
patients and the health plan, and other related costs.
Discussion: The study will provide an important advance in the treatment
of EDs; in the long term, it is expected to improve the quality of
patient care and the treatment efficacy and to reduce waiting lists as
well as direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of EDs
in Spain.},

 abstract = {Background: Smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment and
intervention (EMA/I) show promise for enhancing psychological treatments
for psychosis. EMA has the potential to improve assessment and
formulation of experiences which fluctuate day-to-day, and EMI may be
used to prompt use of therapeutic strategies in daily life. The current
study is an examination of these capabilities in the context of a brief,
coping-focused intervention for distressing voice hearing experiences.
Methods/design: This is a rater-blinded, pilot randomised controlled
trial comparing a four-session intervention in conjunction with use of
smartphone EMA/I between sessions, versus treatment-as-usual. The
recruitment target is 34 participants with persisting and distressing
voice hearing experiences, recruited through a Voices Clinic based in
Melbourne, Australia, and via wider advertising. Allocation will be made
using minimisation procedure, balancing of the frequency of voices
between groups. Assessments are completed at baseline and 8 weeks
post-baseline. The primary outcomes of this trial will focus on
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methodology,
with secondary outcomes examining preliminary clinical effects related
to overall voice severity, the emotional and functional impact of the
voices, and emotional distress.
Discussion: This study offers a highly novel examination of specific
smartphone capabilities and their integration with traditional
psychological treatment for distressing voices. Such technology has
potential to enhance psychological interventions and promote adaptation
to distressing experiences.},

@article{WOS:000431849300003,
 abstract = {Background: Despite the boom in new technologically based interventions
for people with psychosis, recent studies suggest medium to low rates of
adherence to these types of interventions. The benefits will be limited
if only a minority of service users adhere and engage; if specific
predictors of adherence can be identified then technologies can be
adapted to increase the service user benefits.
Objective: The study aimed to present a systematic review of rates of
adherence, dropout, and approaches to analyzing adherence to newly
developed mobile and Web-based interventions for people with psychosis.
Specific predictors of adherence were also explored.
Methods: Using keywords (Internet or online or Web-based or website or
mobile) AND (bipolar disorder or manic depression or manic depressive
illness or manic-depressive psychosis or psychosis or schizophr{*} or
psychotic), the following databases were searched: OVID including
MedLine, EMBASE and PsychInfo, Pubmed and Web of Science. The objectives
and inclusion criteria for suitable studies were defined following PICOS
(population: people with psychosis; intervention: mobile or
Internet-based technology; comparison group: no comparison group
specified; outcomes: measures of adherence; study design: randomized
controlled trials (RCT), feasibility studies, and observational studies)
criteria. In addition to measurement and analysis of adherence, two
theoretically proposed predictors of adherence were examined: (1) level
of support from a clinician or researcher throughout the study, and (2)
level of service user involvement in the app or intervention
development. We provide a narrative synthesis of the findings and
followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and
meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting systematic reviews.
Results: Of the 20 studies that reported a measure of adherence and a
rate of dropout, 5 of these conducted statistical analyses to determine
predictors of dropout, 6 analyzed the effects of specific adherence
predictors (eg, symptom severity or type of technological interface) on
the effects of the intervention, 4 administered poststudy feedback
questionnaires to assess continued use of the intervention, and 2
studies evaluated the effects of different types of interventions on
adherence. Overall, the percentage of participants adhering to
interventions ranged from 28-100\% with a mean of 83\%. Adherence was
greater in studies with higher levels of social support and service user
involvement in the development of the intervention. Studies of shorter
duration also had higher rates of adherence.
Conclusions: Adherence to mobile and Web-based interventions was robust
across most studies. Although 2 studies found specific predictors of
nonadherence (male gender and younger age), most did not specifically
analyze predictors. The duration of the study may be an important
predictor of adherence. Future studies should consider reporting a
universal measure of adherence and aim to conduct complex analyses on
predictors of adherence such as level of social presence and service
user involvement.},

 abstract = {Background: Alcohol use among university students is common, and those
who drink often choose to drink heavily (ie, 4 or more drinks per
session for women or 5 or more for men). Web-based interventions (WBIs),
in which students complete assessments and receive personalized feedback
about their alcohol use, and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs),
which use mobile devices as a method of delivering intervention
information, are 2 methods that have had some success in reducing
alcohol use among university students.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of
a combined WBI and EMI intervention to reduce alcohol use among
university students.
Methods: The study is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Participants
will be randomized into either a WBI+EMI condition, a WBI-only
condition, or an assessment-only control. Our sample will consist of
first-year university students, recruited through 5 residential colleges
at the University of Otago, New Zealand. All participants will complete
an online survey at baseline (ie, before Orientation Week); those in the
WBI-only and WBI+EMI conditions will immediately receive personalized
feedback (ie, the WBI), whereas participants in the assessment-only
condition will receive no feedback. In addition, participants randomized
into the WBI+EMI, but not those in the WBI-only or assessment-only
groups, will receive 8 Orientation Week (2 per day on nights with large
social events) and 6 academic year EMIs (delivered fortnightly).
Participants in all conditions will complete brief surveys at the end of
the first and second semester and report their weekend alcohol use
fortnightly throughout each semester via ecological momentary
assessments.
Results: The primary hypothesis is that participants in the WBI+EMI
group will consume significantly fewer drinks during weekends in their
first semester at university compared with WBI-only and assessment-only
groups. Secondary hypotheses are that, when compared with the WBI-only
and assessment-only groups, the WBI+EMI group will report consuming
fewer drinks during Orientation Week, report experiencing fewer negative
alcohol-related consequences after first semester, and report lower
Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption scores following
their first semester.
Conclusions: This study adds to a growing body of work investigating the
utility of WBIs and EMIs in curbing alcohol consumption. In addition,
the study will help to inform policy approaches aimed at curbing alcohol
consumption and alcohol-related harm in university students.},

 abstract = {Background: Overweight and obesity have become major health problems
globally with more than 1.9 billion overweight adults. In Lebanon, the
prevalence of obesity and overweight is 65.4\% combined. Risk factors of
obesity and overweight are preventable and can be addressed by
modifications in the environment and in an individual's lifestyle.
Mobile technologies are increasingly used in behavioral, self-directed
weight management interventions, providing users with additional
opportunities to attain weight control (weight loss, weight gain
prevention, etc). Mobile apps may allow for the delivery of Just-in-Time
Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), which provide support through skill
building, emotional support, and instrumental support, following the
participants' progress. A few commercially available apps offer JITAI
features, but no studies have tested their efficacy.
Objective: The primary objective of this study is to examine the
feasibility of a self-directed weight loss intervention, targeting
employees of an academic institution, using a virtual coaching app with
JITAI features (Lark) and a self-help calorie-counting app
(MyFitnessPal). The secondary objective is to estimate the effects of
the intervention on main study outcomes.
Methods: This study is a single-center, parallel, randomized controlled
trial with 2 study arms (intervention and control). Participants will be
randomly allocated in equal proportions to the intervention (Lark) and
control groups (MyFitnessPal). To be eligible for this study,
participants must be employed full-or part-time at the university or its
medical center, able to read English, have a smartphone, and be
interested in controlling their weight. Recruitment strategies entail
email invitations, printed posters, and social media postings. We will
assess quantitative rates of recruitment, adherence, and retention,
self-reported app quality using the user version of the Mobile App
Rating Scale. We will also assess changes in weight-related outcomes
(absolute weight and waist circumference), behavioral outcomes (physical
activity and diet), and cognitive factors (motivation to participate in
the trial and to manage weight).
Results: WaznApp was funded in June 2017, and recruitment started in
March 2018.
Conclusions: This study will provide information as to whether the
selected mobile apps offer a feasible solution for promoting weight
management in an academic workplace. The results will inform a larger
trial whose results might be replicated in similar workplaces in Lebanon
and the Middle East and North Africa region, and will be used as a
benchmark for further investigations in other settings and similar
target groups.},

 abstract = {Background: Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that
affects over 100,000 Americans. Sickle cell disease-related
complications lead to significant morbidity and early death. Evidence
supporting the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of
self-management electronic health (eHealth) interventions in chronic
diseases is growing; however, the evidence is unclear in sickle cell
disease.
Objective: We systematically evaluated the most recent evidence in the
literature to (1) review the different types of technological tools used
for self-management of sickle cell disease, (2) discover and describe
what self-management activities these tools were used for, and (3)
assess the efficacy of these technologies in self-management.
Methods: We reviewed literature published between 1995 and 2016 with no
language limits. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and
other sources. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Two independent reviewers screened
titles and abstracts, assessed full-text articles, and extracted data
from articles that met inclusion criteria. Eligible studies were
original research articles that included texting, mobile phone-based
apps, or other eHealth interventions designed to improve self-management
in pediatric and adult patients with sickle cell disease.
Results: Of 1680 citations, 16 articles met all predefined criteria with
a total of 747 study participants. Interventions were text messaging
(4/16, 25\%), native mobile apps (3/16, 19\%), Web-based apps (5/16,
31\%), mobile directly observed therapy (2/16, 13\%), internet-delivered
cognitive behavioral therapy (2/16, 13\%), electronic pill bottle (1/16,
6\%), or interactive gamification (2/16, 13\%). Interventions targeted
monitoring or improvement of medication adherence (5/16, 31\%);
self-management, pain reporting, and symptom reporting (7/16, 44\%);
stress, coping, sleep, and daily activities reporting (4/16, 25\%);
cognitive training for memory (1/16, 6\%); sickle cell disease and
reproductive health knowledge (5/16, 31\%); cognitive behavioral therapy
(2/16, 13\%); and guided relaxation interventions (1/16, 6\%). Most
studies (11/16, 69\%) included older children or adolescents (mean or
median age 10-17 years; 11/16, 69\%) and 5 included young adults (>= 18
years old) (5/16, 31\%). Sample size ranged from 11 to 236, with a
median of 21 per study: < 20 in 6 (38\%), >= 20 to < 50 in 6 (38\%), and
> 50 participants in 4 studies (25\%). Most reported improvement in
self-management-related outcomes (15/16, 94\%), as well as high
satisfaction and acceptability of different study interventions (10/16,
63\%).
Conclusions: Our systematic review identified eHealth interventions
measuring a variety of outcomes, which showed improvement in multiple
components of self-management of sickle cell disease. Despite the
promising feasibility and acceptability of eHealth interventions in
improving self-management of sickle cell disease, the evidence overall
is modest. Future eHealth intervention studies are needed to evaluate
their efficacy, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness in promoting
self-management in patients with sickle cell disease using rigorous
methods and theoretical frameworks with clearly defined clinical
outcomes.},

 abstract = {Design and objective: This paper describes the protocol for a
large-scale pragmatic, randomised controlled trial and economic
evaluation to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
the self-directed E-Couch social anxiety module versus a waiting list
control condition, for reducing sub-clinical social anxiety symptoms in
the general population.
Study population: Community-based adults (aged 18+) with social anxiety
symptoms that do not meet the criteria for social anxiety disorder
recruited via a direct-to-consumer advertisement on national websites.
Intervention and control: Intervention is the self-guided E-Couch social
anxiety module. Control group participants are placed on a waiting list
to receive the intervention at the end of the trial. Both groups receive
email and text message reminders.
Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be change in self-reported
social anxiety score using the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). Secondary
outcomes will be the changes in the following self-report measures:
Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation scale (BFNE-S); depression (CES-D);
mental wellbeing (SWEMWEBS); health status (SF36); use of health
services; safety events; and adherence, retention, and attrition rates.
All measures will be administered at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3, 6 and 12
months.
Analysis: A mixed effects model will be used to analyse the effect of
the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes (intention to
treat analysis). Secondary analyses will explore moderators and
mediators of effect. A prospective economic evaluation, conducted from a
NHS and social care perspective, will provide estimates of cost utility
and cost-effectiveness. An interview study will be conducted with 20
participants to explore issues including acceptability, adherence,
retention and attrition.},

 abstract = {Background: Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and ecological
momentary interventions (EMIs) represent a novel approach for the
assessment and delivery of psychological support to depressed patients
in daily life. Beyond the classical paper-and-pencil daily diaries, the
more recent progresses in Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) enabled researchers to bring all the needed processes together in
only one device, i.e., response signaling, repeated symptom collection,
information storage, secure data transfer, and psychological support
delivery. Despite evidence showing the feasibility and acceptability of
these techniques, EMAs are only beginning to be applied in real clinical
practice, whether the development of EMIs for clinically depressed
patients is still very limited. The objective of this systematic review
is to provide the state of the art of technology-based EMAs and EMIs for
major depressive disorder (MDD), with the aim of leading the way to
possible future directions for the clinical practice.
Methods: We will conduct a systematic review using the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
guidelines. Data sources will include two bibliographic databases,
PubMed and Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), supplemented by searches
for unpublished or ongoing studies. Eligible studies will report data
for adult (>= 18 years old) with a primary (both current and past)
diagnosis of MDD, defined by a valid criterion standard. We will
consider studies adopting technology-based EMAs and EMIs for the
investigation and/or assessment of depression and for the delivery of a
psychological intervention. We will exclude studies adopting
paper-and-pencil tools.
Discussion: The proposed systematic review will provide new insights on
the advantages and benefits of adopting technology-based EMAs and EMIs
for MDD in the traditional clinical practice, taking into consideration
both clinical and technological issues. The potential of using sensors
and biosensors along with machine learning for affective modeling will
also be discussed.},

 abstract = {Background: Mobile apps are being widely used for delivering health
interventions, with their ubiquitous access and sensing capabilities.
One such use is the delivery of interventions for healthy eating
behavior.
Objective: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive view of
the literature on the use of mobile interventions for eating behavior
change. We synthesized the studies with such interventions and mapped
out their input methods, interventions, and outcomes.
Methods: We conducted a scoping literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE,
Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and PsycINFO
databases to identify relevant papers published between January 2013 and
April 2018. We also hand-searched relevant themes of journals in the
Journal of Medical Internet Research and registered protocols. Studies
were included if they provided and assessed mobile-based interventions
for dietary behavior changes and/or health outcomes.
Results: The search resulted in 30 studies that we classified by 3 main
aspects: input methods, mobile-based interventions, and dietary behavior
changes and health outcomes. First, regarding input methods, 5 studies
allowed photo/voice/video inputs of diet information, whereas text input
methods were used in the remaining studies. Other than diet information,
the content of the input data in the mobile apps included user's
demographics, medication, health behaviors, and goals. Second, we
identified 6 categories of intervention contents, that is,
self-monitoring, feedback, gamification, goal reviews, social support,
and educational information. Although all 30 studies included
self-monitoring as a key component of their intervention, personalized
feedback was a component in 18 studies, gamification was used in 10
studies, goal reviews in 5 studies, social support in 3 studies, and
educational information in 2 studies. Finally, we found that 13 studies
directly examined the effects of interventions on health outcomes and 12
studies examined the effects on dietary behavior changes, whereas only 5
studies observed the effects both on dietary behavior changes and health
outcomes. Regarding the type of studies, although two-thirds of the
included studies conducted diverse forms of randomized control trials,
the other 10 studies used field studies, surveys, protocols, qualitative
interviews, propensity score matching method, and test and reference
method.
Conclusions: This scoping review identified and classified studies on
mobile-based interventions for dietary behavior change as per the input
methods, nature of intervention, and outcomes examined. Our findings
indicated that dietary behavior changes, although playing a mediating
role in improving health outcomes, have not been adequately examined in
the literature. Dietary behavior change as a mechanism for the
relationship between mobile-based intervention and health outcomes needs
to be further investigated. Our review provides guidance for future
research in this promising mobile health area.},

 abstract = {Background: Smartphones enable the implementation of just-in-time
adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that tailor the delivery of health
interventions over time to user-and time-varying context
characteristics. Ideally, JITAIs include effective intervention
components, and delivery tailoring is based on effective moderators of
intervention effects. Using machine learning techniques to infer each
user's context from smartphone sensor data is a promising approach to
further enhance tailoring.
Objective: The primary objective of this study is to quantify main
effects, interactions, and moderators of 3 intervention components of a
smartphone-based intervention for physical activity. The secondary
objective is the exploration of participants' states of receptivity,
that is, situations in which participants are more likely to react to
intervention notifications through collection of smartphone sensor data.
Methods: In 2017, we developed the Assistant to Lift your Level of
activitY (Ally), a chatbot-based mobile health intervention for
increasing physical activity that utilizes incentives, planning, and
self-monitoring prompts to help participants meet personalized step
goals. We used a microrandomized trial design to meet the study
objectives. Insurees of a large Swiss insurance company were invited to
use the Ally app over a 12-day baseline and a 6-week intervention
period. Upon enrollment, participants were randomly allocated to either
a financial incentive, a charity incentive, or a no incentive condition.
Over the course of the intervention period, participants were repeatedly
randomized on a daily basis to either receive prompts that support
self-monitoring or not and on a weekly basis to receive 1 of 2 planning
interventions or no planning. Participants completed a Web-based
questionnaire at baseline and postintervention follow-up.
Results: Data collection was completed in January 2018. In total, 274
insurees (mean age 41.73 years; 57.7\% {[}158/274] female) enrolled in
the study and installed the Ally app on their smartphones. Main reasons
for declining participation were having an incompatible smartphone
(37/191, 19.4\%) and collection of sensor data (35/191, 18.3\%). Step
data are available for 227 (82.8\%, 227/274) participants, and
smartphone sensor data are available for 247 (90.1\%, 247/274)
participants.
Conclusions: This study describes the evidence-based development of a
JITAI for increasing physical activity. If components prove to be
efficacious, they will be included in a revised version of the app that
offers scalable promotion of physical activity at low cost.},

 abstract = {Background: There is an increasing prevalence of mental health problems
among university student populations. In Indonesia, treatment rates are
low among university students because of the high cost of treatment,
stigma and the limited availability of mental care services.
Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in treating
anxiety and depression in Western countries. However, little is known
about the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions in low-and
middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Indonesia. In this paper, we
describe how we culturally adapted an Internet-based intervention to
meet the needs of Indonesian students with depression and anxiety based
on the theoretical framework of Barrera et al. (2013).
Method: We culturally adapted a Western Internet-based student
intervention for depression and anxiety. This intervention consists of 8
guided online sessions. 50 students from Universitas Gadjah Mada
Yogyakarta who have mild to moderate depression or anxiety as assessed
with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-7 (GAD-7), will participate in a feasibility study in which we
will test participants' satisfaction, system usability and uptake.
Secondary outcomes include assessment of participants' depression,
anxiety and quality of life. Outcomes will be measured pre and post
intervention.
Discussion: The present paper presents the protocol of a pilot study
aimed at assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally
adapted intervention for Indonesian university students with depression
and anxiety. The results from the feasibility study will further guide
the development of the intervention and may inform the protocol of a
future randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effectiveness of
the Internet-based intervention.},

 abstract = {Background Many adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are
unable to access healthcare services for treatment due to logistical,
social, and attitudinal barriers. Interventions delivered via mobile
applications (apps) may help overcome these barriers. Objective The aim
of this study is to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence
from trials investigating the efficacy of mobile apps for treating PTSD.
Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and Medline were
searched in February 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were
included if they quantitatively evaluated the efficacy of a mobile app
for treating PTSD as part of the primary aim. Findings were presented in
a narrative synthesis. Results In the five identified RCTs, the use of
app-based interventions appeared to be associated with reductions in
PTSD symptoms. However, the strength of evidence for this association
appeared to be inconsistent, and there was little evidence that those
using the apps experienced greater reductions in PTSD symptoms than
those in control conditions. Nonetheless, there was some evidence that
app-based interventions are both a feasible and acceptable treatment
pathway option. Conclusions Included studies were often limited by small
sample sizes, brief intervention, and follow-up periods, and
self-reported measures of PTSD. Evidence for the efficacy of mobile
interventions for treating PTSD was inconclusive, but promising.
Healthcare professionals should exercise caution in recommending
app-based interventions until the potentially adverse effects of app use
are better understood and larger-scale studies have taken place.},

technology-based EMA and EMI for major depressive disorder (MDD). A
total of 33 articles were included (EMA = 26; EMI = 7). First, we
provide a detailed analysis of the included studies from technical
(sampling methods, duration, prompts), clinical (fields of application,
adherence rates, dropouts, intervention effectiveness), and
technological (adopted devices) perspectives. Then, we identify the
advantages of using information and communications technologies (ICTs)
to extend the potential of these approaches to the understanding,
assessment, and intervention in depression. Furthermore, we point out
the relevant issues that still need to be addressed within this field,
and we discuss how EMA and EMI could benefit from the use of sensors and
biosensors, along with recent advances in machine learning for affective
modelling.},

 abstract = {Introduction Millions of children in India still suffer from poor health
and under-nutrition, despite substantial improvement over decades of
public health programmes. The Anganwadi centres under the Integrated
Child Development Scheme (ICDS) provide a range of health and nutrition
services to pregnant women, children < 6 years and their mothers.
However, major gaps exist in ICDS service delivery. The government is
currently strengthening ICDS through an mHealth intervention called
Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) installed on smart phones, with
accompanying multilevel data dashboards. This system is intended to be a
job aid for frontline workers, supervisors and managers, aims to ensure
better service delivery and supervision, and enable real-time monitoring
and data-based decision-making. However, there is little to no evidence
on the effectiveness of such large-scale mHealth interventions
integrated with public health programmes in resource-constrained
settings on the service delivery and subsequent health and nutrition
outcomes.
Methods and analysis This study uses a village-matched controlled design
with repeated cross-sectional surveys to evaluate whether ICDS-CAS can
enable more timely and appropriate services to pregnant women, children
< 12 months and their mothers, compared with the standard ICDS
programme. The study will recruit approximately 1500 Anganwadi workers
and 6000+ mother-child dyads from 400+ matched-pair villages in Bihar
and Madhya Pradesh. The primary outcomes are the proportion of
beneficiaries receiving (a) adequate number of home visits and (b)
appropriate level of counselling by the Anganwadi workers. Secondary
outcomes are related to improvements in other ICDS services, and
knowledge and practices of the Anganwadi workers and beneficiaries.
Ethics and dissemination Ethical oversight is provided by the Committee
for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California at
Berkeley, and the Suraksha Independent Ethics Committee in India. The
results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and analysis data
will be made public.},

 abstract = {Background: Relapse is common in people who experience psychosis and is
associated with many negative consequences, both societal and personal.
People who relapse often exhibit changes (early warning signs {[}EWS])
in the period before relapse. Successful identification of EWS offers an
opportunity for relapse prevention. However, several known barriers
impede the use of EWS monitoring approaches. Early signs Monitoring to
Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote Well-being, Engagement, and
Recovery (EMPOWER) is a complex digital intervention that uses a mobile
app to enhance the detection and management of self-reported changes in
well-being. This is currently being tested in a pilot cluster randomized
controlled trial. As digital interventions have not been widely used in
relapse prevention, little is known about their implementation. Process
evaluation studies run in parallel to clinical trials can provide
valuable data on intervention feasibility.
Objective: This study aims to transparently describe the protocol for
the process evaluation element of the EMPOWER trial. We will focus on
the development of a process evaluation framework sensitive to the
worldview of service users, mental health staff, and carers; the aims of
the process evaluation itself; the proposed studies to address these
aims; and a plan for integration of results from separate process
evaluation studies into one overall report.
Methods: The overall process evaluation will utilize mixed methods
across 6 substudies. Among them, 4 will use qualitative methodologies, 1
will use a mixed methods approach, and 1 will use quantitative
methodologies.
Results: The results of all studies will be triangulated into an overall
analysis and interpretation of key implementation lessons. EMPOWER was
funded in 2016, recruitment finished in January 2018. Data analysis is
currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted
for publication in December 2019.
Conclusions: The findings from this study will help identify
implementation facilitators and barriers to EMPOWER. These insights will
inform both upscaling decisions and optimization of a definitive trial.},

 abstract = {Objective To date the application of eHealth strategies among adults and
adolescents undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) has not
been systematically reviewed. This study comprehensively examines
eHealth intervention studies among MBS patients within the RE-AIM
framework to assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and
maintenance of these efforts. Methods A search was conducted using
PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycNET and SCOPUS of original research relating
to eHealth strategies for MBS patients published in peer-reviewed
journals and revealed 38 published articles between 2011 and 2019.
Results Studies varied widely in terms of design (qualitative to
randomized controlled trials) and eHealth delivery method (telemedicine
to blog post content) with a balance of pre- or post-MBS use. No studies
included adolescents and very few reported (1) a conceptual framework to
support study design/outcomes; and (2) race/ethnicity composition.
Conclusions Although some studies report that eHealth
strategies/interventions are effective in producing post-MBS weight loss
and other positive health outcomes, most are pilot studies or have study
design limitations. There is an opportunity for development of (1)
tailored eHealth interventions to support pre- and post-MBS sustained
behavior change and improved outcomes; and (2) rigorous studies that
employ robust conceptual frameworks so dissemination and implementation
efforts can be mapped to construct-driven outcomes.},

 abstract = {Background: Relapse in schizophrenia is a major cause of distress and
disability and is predicted by changes in symptoms such as anxiety,
depression, and suspiciousness (early warning signs {[}EWSs]). These can
be used as the basis for timely interventions to prevent relapse.
However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the implementation
of EWS interventions.
Objective: This study was designed to establish the feasibility of
conducting a definitive cluster randomized controlled trial comparing
Early signs Monitoring to Prevent relapse in psychosis and prOmote
Well-being, Engagement, and Recovery (EMPOWER) against treatment as
usual (TAU). Our primary outcomes are establishing parameters of
feasibility, acceptability, usability, safety, and outcome signals of a
digital health intervention as an adjunct to usual care that is
deliverable in the UK National Health Service and Australian community
mental health service (CMHS) settings. We will assess the feasibility of
candidate primary outcomes, candidate secondary outcomes, and candidate
mechanisms for a definitive trial.
Methods: We will randomize CMHSs to EMPOWER or TAU. We aim to recruit up
to 120 service user participants from 8 CMHSs and follow them for 12
months. Eligible service users will (1) be aged 16 years and above, (2)
be in contact with local CMHSs, (3) have either been admitted to a
psychiatric inpatient service or received crisis intervention at least
once in the previous 2 years for a relapse, and (4) have an
International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis of a
schizophrenia-related disorder. Service users will also be invited to
nominate a carer to participate. We will identify the feasibility of the
main trial in terms of recruitment and retention to the study and the
acceptability, usability, safety, and outcome signals of the EMPOWER
intervention. EMPOWER is a mobile phone app that enables the monitoring
of well-being and possible EWSs of relapse on a daily basis. An
algorithm calculates changes in well-being based on participants' own
baseline to enable tailoring of well-being messaging and clinical triage
of possible EWSs. Use of the app is blended with ongoing peer support.
Results: Recruitment to the trial began September 2018, and follow-up of
participants was completed in July 2019. Data collection is continuing.
The database was locked in July 2019, followed by analysis and
disclosing of group allocation.
Conclusions: The knowledge gained from the study will inform the design
of a definitive trial including finalizing the delivery of our digital
health intervention, sample size estimation, methods to ensure
successful identification, consent, randomization, and follow-up of
participants, and the primary and secondary outcomes. The trial will
also inform the final health economic model to be applied in the main
trial.},

 abstract = {Introduction The use of adequate self-management strategies for people
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may increase the level
of physical activity (PA), improve health-related quality of life
(HRQoL) and reduce healthcare use. Whether web-based support in addition
to prompts (email and SMS) could be used to promote self-management
strategies to facilitate behaviour change in people with COPD is not
clear. This clinical trial aims to generate evidence on the effect of a
web-based solution, the COPD Web, in a cohort of people with COPD in a
primary healthcare context.
Methods and analysis The overall design is a pragmatic randomised
controlled trial with preassessments and postassessments (3 and 12
months) and an implementation and user experience evaluation. People
with a diagnosis of COPD, treated in primary healthcare will be eligible
for the study. A total of 144 participants will be enrolled by
healthcare professionals at included primary healthcare units and, after
fulfilled baseline assessments, randomised to either control or
intervention group. All participants will receive usual care, a
pedometer and a leaflet about the importance of PA. Participants in the
intervention will, in addition, get access to the COPD Web, an
interactive self-managed website that aims to support people with COPD
in self-management strategies. They will also continuously get support
from prompts with a focus on behaviour change.
The effect on participants' PA, dyspnoea, COPD-related symptoms, HRQoL
and health economics will be assessed using accelerometer and
questionnaires. To identify enablers and barriers for the use of
web-based support to change behaviour, semistructured interviews will be
conducted in a subgroup of participants at the 3 months follow-up.
Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been received from the
Regional Ethical Review Board in Umea, Sweden. Dnr 2018-274-31. Findings
will be presented at conferences, submitted for publication in
peer-reviewed journals and presented to the involved healthcare
professionals, participants and patient organisations.},

 abstract = {Background Family caregivers of patients with severe illness and in need
for a palliative care approach, face numerous challenges and report
having insufficient preparedness for the caregiver role as well as a
need for information and psychosocial support. Preparing to care for a
severely ill family members also means becoming aware of death. Feelings
of being prepared are associated with positive aspects and regarded
protective against negative health consequences. Methods The study
adheres to the SPIRIT-guidelines (Supplementary 1), uses a pre-post
design and include a web-based intervention. Inclusion criteria are;
being a family caregiver of a patient with severe illness and in need of
a palliative care approach. The intervention which aims to increase
preparedness for caregiving and death is grounded in theory, research
and clinical experience. The topics cover: medical issues, symptoms and
symptom relief; communication within the couple, how to spend the time
before death, being a caregiver, planning for the moment of death and;
considerations of the future. The intervention is presented through
videos and informative texts. The website also holds an online
peer-support discussion forum. Study aims are to: evaluate feasibility
in terms of framework, content, usage and partners' experiences; explore
how the use of the website, influences family caregivers' preparedness
for caregiving and death; explore how the use of the website influences
family caregivers' knowledge about medical issues, their communication
with the patient and their considerations of the future; and to
investigate how the family caregivers' preparedness for caregiving and
death influences their physical and psychological health and quality of
life 1 year after the patient's death. Data will be collected through
qualitative interviews and a study-specific questionnaire at four
time-points. Discussion This project will provide information about
whether support via a website has the potential to increase preparedness
for caregiving and death and thereby decrease negative health
consequences for family caregivers of patients affected by severe
illness. It will provide new knowledge about intervention development,
delivery, and evaluation in a palliative care context. Identification of
factors before death and their association with family caregivers'
preparedness and long-term health may change future clinical work.},

 abstract = {Background: The prevalence and consequences of obesity among children
and adolescents remain a leading global public health concern, and
evidence-based, multidisciplinary lifestyle interventions are the
cornerstone of treatment. Mobile electronic devices are widely used
across socioeconomic categories and may provide a means of extending the
reach and efficiency of health care interventions.
Objective: We aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding mobile health
(mHealth) for the treatment of childhood overweight and obesity to map
the breadth and nature of the literature in this field and describe the
characteristics of published studies.
Methods: We conducted a systematic scoping review in line with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
extension for scoping reviews, by searching nine academic databases in
addition to gray literature for studies describing acceptability,
usability, feasibility, effectiveness, adherence, or cost-effectiveness
of interventions assessing mHealth for childhood obesity treatment. We
also hand searched the reference lists of relevant articles. Studies
aimed at the prevention of overweight or obesity were excluded, as were
studies in which mHealth was not the primary mode of treatment delivery
for at least one study arm or was not independently assessed. A random
portion of all abstracts and full texts was double screened by a second
reviewer to ensure consistency. Data were charted according to study
characteristics, including design, participants, intervention content,
behavior change theory (BCT) underpinning the study, mode of delivery,
and outcomes measured.
Results: We identified 42 eligible studies assessing acceptability
(n=7), usability (n=2), feasibility or pilot studies (n=15), treatment
effect (n=17), and fidelity (n=1). Change in BMI z-scores or percentiles
was most commonly measured, among a variety of dietary, physical
activity, psychological, and usability or acceptability measures. SMS,
mobile apps, and wearable devices made up the majority of mobile
interventions, and 69\% (29/42) of the studies specified a BCT used.
Conclusions: Pediatric weight management using mHealth is an emerging
field, with most work to date aimed at developing and piloting such
interventions. Few large trials are published, and these are
heterogeneous in nature and rarely reported according to the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for eHealth guidelines. There
is an evidence gap in the cost-effectiveness analyses of such studies.},

 abstract = {Background: Obesity is linked to a number of chronic health conditions,
such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, and weight loss
interventions are often expensive. Recent systematic reviews concluded
that app and web-based interventions can improve lifestyle behaviors and
weight loss at a reasonable cost, but long-term sustainability needs to
be demonstrated.
Objective: This study protocol is for a 2-year randomized controlled
trial that aims to evaluate the clinical and economic effects of a
primary care, anchored, collaborative, electronic health (eHealth)
lifestyle coaching program (long-term Lifestyle change InterVention and
eHealth Application {[}LIVA] 2.0) in obese participants with and without
type 2 diabetes. The program's primary outcome is weight loss. Its
secondary outcome is the hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) level, and its
tertiary outcomes are retention rate, quality of life (QOL), and cost
effectiveness. Analytically, the focus is on associations of participant
characteristics with outcomes and sustainability.
Methods: We conduct a multicenter trial with a 1-year intervention and
1-year retention. LIVA 2.0 is implemented in municipalities within
administrative regions in Denmark, specifically eight municipalities
located within the Region of Southern Denmark and two municipalities
located within the Capital Region of Denmark. The participants are
assessed at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. Individual
data from the LIVA 2.0 platform are combined with clinical measurements,
questionnaires, and participants' usage of municipality and health care
services. The participants have a BMI >= 30 but <= 45 kg/m2, and 50\% of
the participants have type 2 diabetes. The participants are randomized
in an approximately 60:40 manner, and based on sample size calculations
on weight loss and intention-to-treat statistics, 200 participants are
randomized to an intervention group and 140 are randomized to a control
group. The control group is offered the conventional preventive program
of the municipality, and it is compared to the intervention group, which
follows the LIVA 2.0 in addition to the conventional preventive program.
Results: The first baseline assessments have been carried out in March
2018, and the 2-year follow-up will be carried out between March 2020
and April 2021. The hypothesis is that the trial results will
demonstrate decreased body weight and that the number of patients who
show normalization of their HbA1c levels in the intervention group will
be much higher than that in the control group. The participants in the
intervention group are also expected to show a greater decrease in their
use of glucose-lowering medication and a greater improvement in their
QOL when compared with the control group. Operational costs are expected
to be lower than standard care, and the intervention is expected to be
cost-effective.
Conclusions: This is the first time that an app and web-based eHealth
lifestyle coaching program implemented in Danish municipalities will be
clinically and economically evaluated. If the LIVA 2.0 eHealth lifestyle
coaching program is proven to be effective, there is great potential for
decreasing the rates of obesity, diabetes, and related chronic diseases.},

 abstract = {Background: One in 5 young people grow up in a family where one parent
has experienced a mental health problem or substance use concern.
Compared with their same-aged peers, these youth are at a higher risk of
academic failure and acquiring a substance abuse and/or mental health
issue. There is a paucity of accessible, age-appropriate interventions
that address their needs.
Objective: A 6-week, web-based intervention, ``mental illness:
supported, preventative, online, targeted{''} (mi.spot), was developed
based on previous research and the competence enhancement model. This
paper describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial and
details how the usage, safety, acceptability, and feasibility of the
intervention will be determined.
Methods: Participants will be recruited through social media and
clinician referral. A total of 70 Australians, aged 18 to 25 years, who
grew up with parents with a mental illness or substance use concern will
participate in a 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial. The
assessment will consist of a baseline measurement and 2 follow-up
periods, posttest and 6-week follow-up, using the Mental Health
Continuum short form; the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; the
Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory; the General Help
Seeking Questionnaire; the Social Connectedness Scale; the Mental Health
Literacy Scale; the General Self-Efficacy Scale; and the Attribution of
Responsibility for Parental Mental Illness Measure. Impact will be
examined at pre, post, and follow-up time periods using analyses of
variance that will include a within-subjects factor (time) and a
between-subjects factor (intervention/control). Facilitator interviews
will ascertain intervention feasibility. Participant interviews will
ascertain intervention acceptability. Interview data will be analyzed
within a qualitative framework. Usage (data analytics) across site
features and several indicators of clinical safety will also be
reported.
Results: The impact of mi.spot will be examined at pre, post, and
follow-up time periods using analyses of variance on each of the
measures outlined above. There will be a within-subjects factor (time)
and a between-subjects factor (intervention/control). Data analysis will
employ the intention-to-treat principle by including all participants in
the analyses. Qualitative interview data will be analyzed using
interpretative phenomenological analysis along with respondent
validation. The Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee
(reference number: 2019-18660-30434) approved the trial on April 17,
2019. As of October 2, 2019, 30 participants were enrolled in the
control group and 34 participants were enrolled in the intervention
group. Result are expected to be submitted for publication in December
2020.
Conclusions: Study results will provide reliable evidence on a web-based
intervention that has the potential to make a difference to the lives of
many vulnerable young adults. Implementation guidelines are needed to
embed the intervention in different service sectors.},

 abstract = {Background: Hydroxyurea prevents disease complications among patients
with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although its efficacy has been endorsed
by the National Health Lung and Blood Institute evidence-based
guidelines, its adoption is low, both by patients with SCD and
providers. Mobile health (mHealth) apps provide benefits in improving
medication adherence and self-efficacy among patients with chronic
diseases and have facilitated prescription among medical providers.
However, mHealth has not been systematically tested as a tool to
increase hydroxyurea adherence nor has the combination of mHealth been
assessed at both patient and provider levels to increase hydroxyurea
utilization.
Objective: This study aims to increase hydroxyurea utilization through a
combined two-level mHealth intervention for both patients with SCD and
their providers with the goals of increasing adherence to hydroxyurea
among patients and improve hydroxyurea prescribing behavior among
providers.
Methods: We will test the efficacy of 2 mHealth interventions to
increase both patient and provider utilization and knowledge of
hydroxyurea in 8 clinical sites of the NHLBI-funded Sickle Cell Disease
Implementation Consortium (SCDIC). The patient mHealth intervention,
InCharge Health, includes multiple components that address memory,
motivation, and knowledge barriers to hydroxyurea use. The provider
mHealth intervention, Hydroxyurea Toolbox (HU Toolbox), addresses the
clinical knowledge barriers in prescribing and monitoring hydroxyurea.
The primary hypothesis is that among adolescents and adults with SCD,
adherence to hydroxyurea, as measured by the proportion of days covered
(the ratio of the number of days the patient is covered by the
medication to the number of days in the treatment period), will increase
by at least 20\% after 24 weeks of receiving the InCharge Health app,
compared with their adherence at baseline. As secondary objectives, we
will (1) examine the change in health-related quality of life, acute
disease complications, perceived health literacy, and perceived
self-efficacy in taking hydroxyurea among patients who use InCharge
Health and (2) examine potential increases in the awareness of
hydroxyurea benefits and risks, appropriate prescribing, and perceived
self-efficacy to correctly administer hydroxyurea therapy among SCD
providers between baseline and 9 months of using the HU Toolbox app. We
will measure the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of
both the InCharge Health and the HU Toolbox apps using the reach,
effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance framework and
qualitatively evaluate the implementation of both mHealth interventions.
Results: The study is currently enrolling study participants.
Recruitment is anticipated to be completed by mid-2021.
Conclusions: If this two-level intervention, that is, the combined use
of InCharge Health and HU Toolbox apps, demonstrates efficacy in
increasing adherence to hydroxyurea and prescribing behavior in patients
with SCD and their providers, respectively, both apps will be offered to
other institutions outside the SCDIC through a future large-scale
implementation-effectiveness study.},

 abstract = {BackgroundProcess evaluation can illuminate barriers and facilitators to
intervention implementation as well as the drivers of intervention
outcomes. However, few obesity intervention studies have documented
process evaluation methods and results. Community-based participatory
research (CBPR) requires that process evaluation methods be developed to
(a) prioritize community members' power to adapt the program to local
needs over strict adherence to intervention protocols, (b) share process
evaluation data with implementers to maximize benefit to participants,
and (c) ensure partner organizations are not overburdened. Co-designed
with low-income parents using CBPR, Communities for Healthy Living (CHL)
is a family-centered intervention implemented within Head Start to
prevent childhood obesity and promote family well-being. We are
currently undertaking a randomized controlled trial to test the
effectiveness of CHL in 23 Head Start centers in the greater Boston
area. In this protocol paper, we outline an embedded process evaluation
designed to monitor intervention adherence and adaptation, support
ongoing quality improvement, and examine contextual factors that may
moderate intervention implementation and/or effectiveness.MethodsThis
mixed methods process evaluation was developed using the Perez et al.
framework for evaluating adaptive interventions and is reported
following guidelines outlined by Grant et al. Trained research
assistants will conduct structured observations of intervention
sessions. Intervention facilitators and recipients, along with Head
Start staff, will complete surveys and semi-structured interviews.
De-identified data for all eligible children and families will be
extracted from Head Start administrative records. Qualitative data will
be analyzed thematically. Quantitative and qualitative data will be
integrated using triangulation methods to assess intervention adherence,
monitor adaptations, and identify moderators of intervention
implementation and effectiveness.DiscussionA diverse set of quantitative
and qualitative data sources are employed to fully characterize CHL
implementation. Simultaneously, CHL's process evaluation will provide a
case study on strategies to address the challenges of process evaluation
for CBPR interventions. Results from this process evaluation will help
to explain variation in intervention implementation and outcomes across
Head Start programs, support CHL sustainability and future scale-up, and
provide guidance for future complex interventions developed using

 abstract = {BackgroundWhile work-related rumination increases the risk of acute
stressors developing into chronic load reactions and adverse health,
mental detachment has been suggested as a way to interrupt this chain.
Despite the importance of mentally detaching from work during leisure
time, workers seem to struggle to disengage and, instead, experience the
constant mental representation of work-related stressors, regardless of
their absence. Those who struggle with work-related rumination could
benefit from an easy-access intervention that fosters mental detachment
by promoting recreational activities. Especially during vacations,
workers appear to naturally engage in sufficient recovery activities;
however, this beneficial behaviour is not sustained. The smartphone
app-based intervention ``Holidaily{''} promotes recovery behaviour and,
thus, mental detachment from work with the intension of extending the
beneficial effects of workers' vacations into their daily working
life.MethodsThis randomised-controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the
efficacy of ``Holidaily{''}. The Holidaily app is a German stand-alone
program for mobile devices with either Android/iOS operating systems.
The sample includes workers, who are awaiting to go on vacation and are
randomly assigned to either the intervention (IG) or a waitlist-control
group (CG). The IG receives two weeks pre-vacation access to Holidaily,
while the CG receives access two weeks post-vacation. On a daily basis
participants in the IG are provided with three options promoting
recreational activities and beneficial recovery experiences. Online
questionnaires are distributed to all participants at several
timepoints. The primary outcome measure assesses participants'
work-related rumination (Irritation Scale). A significant difference two
weeks post-vacation is expected, favouring the IG. Secondary outcomes
include symptoms of depression, insomnia severity, emotional exhaustion,
thinking about work, recovery experiences, vacation specifics, work and
personal characteristics. To help explain the intervention's effect,
explorative analyses will investigate the mediation properties of the
frequency of engaging in recreational activities and the moderation
properties of Holidaily users' experiences.DiscussionIf successful,
workers will maintain their recovery behaviour beyond their vacation
into daily working life. Findings could, therefore, provide evidence for
low-intensity interventions that could be very valuable from a
public-health perspective. App-based interventions have greater reach;
hence, more workers might access preventative tools to protect
themselves from developing adverse health effects linked to work-related
rumination. Further studies will still be needed to investigate whether
the vacation phenomenon of ``lots of fun quickly gone{''} can be defied
and long-term benefits attained.Trial registrationGerman Clinical Trials

 abstract = {Background: Digital interventions have been identified as a possible
tool for reducing the harm caused by illicit drug use among students
attending higher education (ie, college students). However, the success
of interventions in this area has been hampered by a lack of user
involvement and behavior change theory in their design. The My
Understanding of Substance use Experiences (MyUSE) project combines a
rigorous user-centered design (UCD) methodology and a robust behavioral
change framework to develop a digitally delivered harm reduction
intervention for illicit drug use among students in higher education.
Objective: This project aims to design and develop a digital
intervention that targets drug use-related harm among students in higher
education.
Methods: The MyUSE project will take place over 3 phases. The first
phase was exploratory in nature, involving 3 systematic reviews, a large
survey, and student workshops to gather a comprehensive evidence base to
guide the project. The second phase is the development stage of the
project, involving the use of the Behavior Change Wheel theoretical
framework to determine the behavior change techniques of the
intervention and the use of the UCD methodology to guide the development
of the digital intervention. The third phase is the evaluation stage,
whereby the intervention will undergo a 5-stage evaluation process to
comprehensively evaluate its impacts.
Results: The exploratory phase 1 of the MyUSE project was completed in
December 2018. Phase 2 is currently underway, and phase 3 is due to
begin in September 2020.
Conclusions: Higher education institutions (HEIs) are ideally placed to
intervene and support students in the area of illicit drug use but are
constrained by limited resources. Current digital interventions in this
area are sparse and have several weaknesses. The MyUSE project combines
a UCD approach with a robust behavior change framework to develop a
digitally delivered intervention that is economically viable, effective
in changing behavior, usable and acceptable to students, and able to
sustain long-term implementation in HEIs.},

 abstract = {Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is not curable, but the symptoms can be
managed through self-management programs (SMPs). Owing to the growing
burden of OA on the health system and the need to ensure high-quality
integrated services, delivering SMPs through digital technologies could
be an economic and effective community-based approach.
Objective: This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of digital-based
structured SMPs on patient outcomes in people with OA.
Methods: A total of 7 web-based and 3 gray literature databases were
searched for randomized controlled trials assessing digital-based
structured SMPs on self-reported outcomes including pain, physical
function, disability, and health-related quality of life (QoL) in people
with OA. Two reviewers independently screened the search results and
reference lists of the identified papers and related reviews. Data on
the intervention components and delivery and behavioral change
techniques used were extracted. A meta-analysis, risk of bias
sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis were performed where
appropriate. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development,
and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of
evidence.
Results: A total of 8 studies were included in this review involving
2687 patients with knee (n=2); knee, hip, or both (n=5); and unspecified
joint (n=1) OA. SMPs were delivered via telephone plus audio and video,
internet, or mobile apps. Studies reported that digital-based structured
SMPs compared with the treatment as usual control group (n=7) resulted
in a significant, homogeneous, medium reduction in pain and improvement
in physical function (standardized mean difference {[}SMD] -0.28, 95\%
CI -0.38 to -0.18 and SMD -0.26, 95\% CI -0.35 to -0.16, respectively)
at posttreatment. The digital-based structured SMP effect on pain and
function reduced slightly at the 12-month follow-up but remained to be
medium and significant. The posttreatment effect of digital based
structured SMPs was small and significant for disability, but
nonsignificant for QoL (SMD -0.10, 95\% CI -0.17 to 0.03 and SMD -0.17,
95\% CI -0.47 to 0.14, respectively; each reported in 1 study only). The
12-month follow-up effect of the intervention was very small for
disability and QoL. The quality of evidence was rated as moderate for
pain and physical function and low and very low for disability and QoL,
respectively, using the GRADE approach.
Conclusions: Digital-based structured SMPs may result in improvement in
pain and physical function that is largely sustained at the 12-month
follow-up in people with knee and hip OA. The effects on disability and
QoL are smaller and less clear. The quality of evidence is moderate to
low, and further research is required to confirm the findings of the
review and assess the effects of digital-based structured SMPs on other
health-related outcomes.},

 abstract = {Evidence-based psychosocial interventions for borderline personality
disorder (BPD) still face multiple challenges regarding treatment
accessibility, adherence, duration, and economic costs. Over the last
decade, technology has addressed these concerns from different
disciplines. The current scoping review aimed to delineate novel and
ongoing clinical research on technology-based psychosocial interventions
for patients with BPD. Online databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library,
EMBASE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar) were searched up
to June 2020. Technology-based psychosocial treatments included
innovative communication (eHealth) and computational (e.g., artificial
intelligence), computing (e.g., computer-based), or medical (e.g.,
functional magnetic resonance imaging {[}fMRI]) software. Clinical
research encompassed any testing stage (e.g., feasibility, efficacy).
Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The main findings were the
following: almost two-thirds of the studies (9/15) tested software
explicitly conceived as adjunctive interventions to conventional
therapy; nearly half of the studies (7/15) were referred to as
dialectical behavior therapy-based software; most studies (13/15) were
focused on the initial stage of the clinical research cycle
(feasibility/acceptance/usability testing), reporting good results at
this point; more than one-third of the studies (6/15) tested mobile
apps; there is emerging evidence for Internet-based interventions and
real-time fMRI biofeedback but only little evidence for mHealth
interventions, virtual and augmented reality, and computer-based
interventions; there was no computational technology-based clinical
research; and there was no satisfaction/preference, security/safety, or
efficiency testing for any software. Taken together, the results suggest
that there is a growing but still incipient amount of technology-based
psychosocial interventions for BPD supported by some kind of clinical
evidence. The limitations and directions for future research are
discussed.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Latinos, the largest minority group in the U.S.,
experience tobacco-related disparities, including limited access to
cessation resources. Evidence supports the efficacy of mobile
interventions for smoking cessation, which may be greater among Latinos,
the highest users of text messaging.
Objectives: To describe the methodology of a randomized clinical trial
to evaluate the impact of Decidetexto, a culturally appropriate mobile
smoking cessation intervention versus standard care on smoking
abstinence (cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence) at
Month 6 among Latino smokers.
Methods: Latino smokers (N = 618) will be randomized to one of two
conditions: 1) Decidetexto or 2) standard of care. Decidetexto is a
mobile smoking cessation intervention (available in English and Spanish)
that incorporates three integrated components: 1) a tablet-based
software that collects smoking-related information to develop an
individualized quit plan, 2) a 24-week text messaging counseling program
with interactive capabilities, and 3) pharmacotherapy support.
Decidetexto follows the Social Cognitive Theory as theoretical
framework. Standard of care consists of printed smoking cessation
materials along with referral to telephone quitline. Participants in
both groups are given access to free pharmacotherapy (nicotine patches
or gum) by calling study phone number. Promotores de Salud will rely on
community-based approaches and clinical settings to recruit smokers into
the study. All participants will complete follow-up assessments at Week
12 and Month 6.
Discussion: If successful, Decidetexto will be ready to be implemented
in different community- and clinic-based settings to reduce
tobacco-related disparities.},

 abstract = {Background: Well-designed mobile health (mHealth) interventions support
a positive user experience; however, a high rate of disengagement has
been reported as a common concern regarding mHealth interventions. To
address this issue, it is necessary to summarize the design features
that improve user engagement based on research over the past 10 years,
during which time the popularity of mHealth interventions has rapidly
increased due to the use of smartphones.
Objective: The aim of this review was to answer the question ``Which
design features improve user engagement with mHealth interventions?{''}
by summarizing published literature with the purpose of guiding the
design of future mHealth interventions.
Methods: This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. Databases, namely,
PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid EMBASE, and Ovid
PsycINFO, were searched for English and Chinese language papers
published from January 2009 to June 2019. Thematic analysis was
undertaken to assess the design features in eligible studies. The Mixed
Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess study quality.
Results: A total of 35 articles were included. The investigated mHealth
interventions were mainly used in unhealthy lifestyle (n=17) and chronic
disease (n=10) prevention programs. Mobile phone apps (n=24) were the
most common delivery method. Qualitative (n=22) and mixed methods (n=9)
designs were widely represented. We identified the following 7 themes
that influenced user engagement: personalization (n=29), reinforcement
(n=23), communication (n=20), navigation (n=17), credibility (n=16),
message presentation (n=16), and interface aesthetics (n=7). A checklist
was developed that contained these 7 design features and 29
corresponding specific implementations derived from the studies.
Conclusions: This systematic review and thematic synthesis identified
useful design features that make an mHealth intervention more user
friendly. We generated a checklist with evidence-based items to enable
developers to use our findings easily. Future evaluations should use
more robust quantitative approaches to elucidate the relationships
between design features and user engagement.},

 abstract = {Introduction Although physical activity (PA) reduces cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk, physical inactivity remains a pressing public health
concern, especially among African American (AA) women in the USA. PA
interventions focused on AA women living in resource-limited communities
with scarce PA infrastructure are needed. Mobile health (mHealth)
technology can increase access to PA interventions. We describe the
development of a clinical protocol for a multilevel, community-based,
mHealth PA intervention for AA women.
Methods and analysis An mHealth intervention targeting AA women living
in resource-limited Washington, DC communities was developed based on
the socioecological framework for PA. Over 6 months, we will use a
Sequential Multi-Assignment, Randomized Trial approach to compare the
effects on PA of location-based remote messaging (named
`tailored-to-place') to standard remote messaging in an mHealth
intervention. Participants will be randomised to a remote messaging
intervention for 3 months, at which point the intervention strategy will
adapt based on individuals' PA levels. Those who do not meet the PA goal
will be rerandomised to more intensive treatment. Participants will be
followed for another 3 months to determine the contribution of each
mHealth intervention to PA level. This protocol will use novel
statistical approaches to account for the adaptive strategy. Finally,
effects of PA changes on CVD risk biomarkers will be characterised.
Ethics and dissemination This protocol has been developed in partnership
with a Washington, DC-area community advisory board to ensure
feasibility and acceptability to community members. The National
Institutes of Health Intramural IRB approved this research and the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute provided funding. Once
published, results of this work will be disseminated to community
members through presentations at community advisory board meetings and
our quarterly newsletter.},

 abstract = {Background: Medication nonadherence leads to suboptimal treatment
outcomes, making it a major priority in health care. eHealth provides an
opportunity to offer medication adherence interventions with minimal
effort from health care providers whose time and resources are limited.
Objective: The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (1) to evaluate
effectiveness of recently developed and tested interactive eHealth
(including mHealth) interventions on medication adherence in adult
patients using long-term medication and (2) to describe strategies among
effective interventions.
Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science
were systematically searched from January 2014 to July 2019 as well as
reference lists and citations of included articles. Eligible studies
fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized controlled
trial with a usual care control group; (2) a total sample size of at
least 50 adult patients using long-term medication; (3) applying an
interactive eHealth intervention aimed at the patient or patient's
caregiver; and (4) medication adherence as primary outcome. Methodologic
quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Selection and
quality assessment of studies were performed by 2 researchers (BP and
BvdB or JV) independently. A best evidence synthesis was performed
according to the Cochrane Back Review Group.
Results: Of the 9047 records screened, 22 randomized clinical trials
were included reporting on 29 interventions. Most (21/29, 72\%)
interventions specified using a (mobile) phone for calling, SMS text
messaging, or mobile apps. A majority of all interactive interventions
(17/29) had a statistically significant effect on medication adherence
(P<.05). Of these interventions, 9 had at least a small effect size
(Cohen d >= 0.2) and 3 showed strong odds for becoming adherent in the
intervention group (odds ratio > 2.0). Our best evidence synthesis
provided strong evidence for a positive effect of interventions using
SMS text messages or interactive voice response, mobile app, and calls
as mode of providing adherence tele-feedback. Intervention strategies
``to teach medication management skills,{''} ``to improve health care
quality by coordinating medication adherence care between
professionals,{''} and ``to facilitate communication or decision making
between patients and health care providers{''} also showed strong
evidence for a positive effect.
Conclusions: Overall, this review supports the hypothesis that
interactive eHealth interventions can be effective in improving
medication adherence. Intervention strategies that improve patients'
treatment involvement and their medication management skills are most
promising and should be considered for implementation in practice.},

 abstract = {Background: Accumulating evidence suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has
negative effects on public mental health. Digital interventions that
have been developed and evaluated in recent years may be used to
mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic. However,
evidence-based recommendations on the use of existing telemedicine and
internet-based (eHealth) and app-based mobile health (mHealth)
interventions are lacking.
Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the theoretical and
empirical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and
cost-effectiveness of digital interventions related to public mental
health provision (ie, mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment
of mental disorders) that may help to reduce the consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and
CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion
criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses
that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or
treatment of mental health conditions and determinants likely affected
by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Results: Overall, 815 peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses
were identified, of which 83 met the inclusion criteria. Our findings
suggest that there is good evidence on the usability, safety,
acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions.
Evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components
(eg, blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated.
Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment
of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion.
However, evidence on process quality, cost-effectiveness, and long-term
effects is very limited.
Conclusions: There is evidence that digital interventions are
particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the
population level. In times of physical distancing, quarantine, and
restrictions on social contacts, decision makers should develop digital
strategies for continued mental health care and invest time and efforts
in the development and implementation of mental health promotion and
prevention programs.},

 abstract = {Background: Shift work sleep disorders (SWSDs) are associated with the
high turnover rates of nurses, and are considered a major medical safety
issue. However, initial management can be hampered by insufficient
awareness. In recent years, it has become possible to visualize,
collect, and analyze the work-life balance of health care workers with
irregular sleeping and working habits using wearable sensors that can
continuously monitor biometric data under real-life settings. In
addition, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for psychiatric
disorders has been shown to be effective. Application of wearable
sensors and machine learning may potentially enhance the beneficial
effects of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy.
Objective: In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate the effect of a
new internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for SWSD (iCBTS). This
system includes current methods such as medical sleep advice, as well as
machine learning well-being prediction to improve the sleep durations of
shift workers and prevent declines in their well-being.
Methods: This study consists of two phases: (1) preliminary data
collection and machine learning for well-being prediction; (2)
intervention and evaluation of iCBTS for SWSD. Shift workers in the
intensive care unit at Mie University Hospital will wear a wearable
sensor that collects biometric data and answer daily questionnaires
regarding their well-being. They will subsequently be provided with an
iCBTS app for 4 weeks. Sleep and well-being measurements between
baseline and the intervention period will be compared.
Results: Recruitment for phase 1 ended in October 2019. Recruitment for
phase 2 has started in October 2020. Preliminary results are expected to
be available by summer 2021.
Conclusions: iCBTS empowered with well-being prediction is expected to

 abstract = {Background: An unhealthy eating pattern and loneliness negatively
influence quality of life in older age. Embodied conversational agents
(ECAs) are a promising way to address these health behaviors in an
engaging manner.
Objective: We aim to (1) identify whether ECAs can persuade
community-dwelling older adults to change their dietary behavior and
whether ECA use can decrease loneliness, (2) test these pathways to
effects, and (3) understand the use of an ECA.
Methods: The web-based eHealth app PACO is a fully automated 8-week
intervention in which 2 ECAs engage older adults in dialogue to motivate
them to change their dietary behavior and decrease their loneliness.
PACO was developed via a human-centered and stakeholder-inclusive design
approach and incorporates Self-determination Theory and various behavior
change techniques. For this study, an unblinded randomized controlled
trial will be performed. There will be 2 cohorts, with 30 participants
per cohort. Participants in the first cohort will immediately receive
the PACO app for 8 weeks, while participants in the second cohort
receive the PACO app after a waiting-list condition of 4 weeks.
Participants will be recruited via social media, an online panel,
flyers, and advertorials. To be eligible, participants must be at least
65 years of age, must not be in paid employment, and must live alone
independently at home. Primary outcomes will be self-assessed via online
questionnaires at intake, control, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks, and
will include eating behavior and loneliness. In addition, the primary
outcome-use-will be measured via data logs. Secondary outcomes will be
measured at the same junctures, via either validated, self-assessed,
online questionnaires or an optional interview.
Results: As of July 2020, we have begun recruiting participants.
Conclusions: By unraveling the mechanisms behind the use of a web-based
intervention with ECAs, we hope to gain a fine-grained understanding of
both the effectiveness and the use of ECAs in the health context.},

 abstract = {Background: In hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), family
communication of genetic test results is essential for cascade genetic
screening, that is, identifying and testing blood relatives of known
mutation carriers to determine whether they also carry the pathogenic
variant, and to propose preventive and clinical management options.
However, up to 50\% of blood relatives are unaware of relevant genetic
information, suggesting that potential benefits of genetic testing are
not communicated effectively within family networks. Technology can
facilitate communication and genetic education within HBOC families.
Objective: The aims of this study are to develop the K-CASCADE
(Korean-Cancer Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) cohort in Korea
by expanding an infrastructure developed by the CASCADE (Cancer
Predisposition Cascade Genetic Testing) Consortium in Switzerland;
develop a digital health intervention to support the communication of
cancer predisposition for Swiss and Korean HBOC families, based on
linguistic and cultural adaptation of the Family Gene Toolkit; evaluate
its efficacy on primary (family communication of genetic results and
cascade testing) and secondary (psychological distress, genetic
literacy, active coping, and decision making) outcomes; and explore its
translatability using the reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation, and maintenance framework.
Methods: The digital health intervention will be available in French,
German, Italian, Korean, and English and can be accessed via the web,
mobile phone, or tablet (ie, device-agnostic). K-CASCADE cohort of
Korean HBOC mutation carriers and relatives will be based on the CASCADE
infrastructure. Narrative data collected through individual interviews
or mini focus groups from 20 to 24 HBOC family members per linguistic
region and 6-10 health care providers involved in genetic services will
identify the local cultures and context, and inform the content of the
tailored messages. The efficacy of the digital health intervention
against a comparison website will be assessed in a randomized trial with
104 HBOC mutation carriers (52 in each study arm). The translatability
of the digital health intervention will be assessed using survey data
collected from HBOC families and health care providers.
Results: Funding was received in October 2019. It is projected that data
collection will be completed by January 2023 and results will be
published in fall 2023.
Conclusions: This study addresses the continuum of translational
research, from developing an international research infrastructure and
adapting an existing digital health intervention to testing its efficacy
in a randomized controlled trial and exploring its translatability using
an established framework. Adapting existing interventions, rather than
developing new ones, takes advantage of previous valid experiences
without duplicating efforts. Culturally sensitive web-based
interventions that enhance family communication and understanding of
genetic cancer risk are timely. This collaboration creates a research
infrastructure between Switzerland and Korea that can be scaled up to
cover other hereditary cancer syndromes.},

 abstract = {Background: Diabetes prevalence has become a global crisis. Due to the
substantial rise in smartphone use, a variety of mobile interventions
have been developed to help improve the clinical outcomes of diabetes
patients. Objectives: This study seeks to examine specific behavior
change theories and techniques used in the design of self-management
mobile app-based interventions aimed at achieving glycemic control in
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Methods: A meta-analysis of randomized
control trials published in PubMed/Medline and Web of Science between
January 2010 and October 2020 was conducted using studies that included
diabetes patients, reported on well-described mobile app-based
interventions, compared mHealth to usual care, and evaluated glycated
hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and follow-up. Results: We reported on 21
studies with a total of 1,920 diabetes patients. Our findings show that
mHealth apps led to statistically significant clinical outcomes as
compared to standard care for glycemic control (-0.38, 95\% CI = -0.50
to -0.25, p < 0.0001) indicating that such interventions result in a
reduction in HbA1c. Interventions that used behavior theory for
developing mHealth apps were not statistically different from those that
did not (p = 0.18). However, increased use of behavior change techniques
(BCTs) may result in slightly higher HbA1c reduction. Among all BCTs,
the most effective ones appear to be ``Action planning{''} and
``Self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behavior. Conclusions: The current
meta-analysis provides evidence that mHealth is likely to be beneficial
for diabetes patients when the right behavior change techniques are
applied to realize the full advantage of the intervention. Further
investigation of the role of theory in the design of mHealth app-based
interventions is warranted.},

 abstract = {Background Most children and young people (CYP) worldwide are classified
as inactive because they fail to meet the World Health Organisation
recommendations for physical activity. Online interventions that use
devices like exergames, smartphones, social media, and wearables have
the potential to improve physical activity engagement because of their
extensive reach and opportunities for learning and use across contexts.
Purpose The objectives of this systematic review were to update the
evidence-base on online physical activity interventions for CYP since
2015, analyse the outcomes associated with online interventions across
physical, cognitive, social and affective domains, and assess the
mechanisms (i.e. pedagogical strategies) of online interventions that
resulted in outcomes related to physical activity. Methods A systematic
search of the literature was conducted across 4 databases (MEDLINE,
PudMed, EBSCO and EMBASE) using key words related to online
interventions, physical activity and CYP. The inclusion criteria were:
CYP aged 5-18 years in the general population; use of an online-based
medium to deliver an intervention related to physical activity; outcomes
related to changes to physical activity, and in physical, cognitive,
social and affective domains; and quantitative, qualitative and mixed
methods studies. A modified version of the Quality Assessment Tool for
Studies with Diverse Designs was used to assess study quality. A mixed
methods approach was used to analyse and synthesise all evidence.
Results 26 papers were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria,
including randomised control trials (n=8), non-randomised interventions
(n=12), observational studies (n=3) and qualitative papers (n=3). The
target population of most studies was children (<12 years) where data
collection mostly took place in a school setting, in elementary schools,
and in physical education lessons. The interventions reported on
positive changes to CYP's physical activity behaviours, through
increases in physical activity levels and emotions, attitudes and
motivations toward physical activity. Gamification and personalisation
were the main mechanisms of online interventions that elicited positive
changes in behaviours. Conclusions The studies in this review provide a
convincing rationale for the use of online interventions to support
CYP's engagement with physical activity, due to the positive effects on
physical and affective outcomes. New evidence is provided on the key
mechanisms of online interventions (gamification and personalised
learning) and the contexts in which online interventions are likely to
be effective (elementary school PE) that can be used by health and
education practitioners, organisations, policy makers and/or researchers
to reach and engage CYP in physical activity. This study had some
limitations that mainly relate to variation in study design,
over-reliance of self-reported measures, and sample characteristics,
that prevented comparative analysis. Registration number: PROPSERO;

 abstract = {Background Substance abuse represents a foremost national concern for
adolescents and adults; investigators have implemented a variety of
interventions, delivered with both in-person and mobile-based apps'
modalities. The electronic techniques could be more effective because
they avoid the cost, privacy, and accessibility issues associated with
in-person intervention. To address this issue, a systematic review of
the scientific evidence relative to the efficacy of app-based
interventions delivered by mobile devices (smartphones) to reduce
substance abuse in adolescents and adults was carried out. Methods To
identify relevant studies published from 2005 to 2019, a comprehensive
search was conducted. Databases that were searched include CINAHL,
Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. Keywords
and relevant controlled vocabulary terms related to substance abuse and
technology were included. Studies were included if they had examined
reductions in substance abuse and problem behaviors as a primary outcome
with app-based interventions delivered to adolescents and adults.
Results The initial search yielded 21,641 articles, duplicates were
removed, and 14,797 citations remained; title/abstract screening yielded
190 full-text articles. One hundred seventy-three were excluded because
they did not meet the inclusion criteria, leaving 17 final articles to
be analyzed in this review. Use of app-based interventions showed some
evidence of effectiveness in reducing substance abuse in the adolescent
adult population. Conclusion Most intervention studies analyzed focused
on alcohol reduction. Further research is needed on diverse substance
abuse utilizing larger sample sizes, longitudinal studies, and
theoretical foundations on the practice of delivering interventions
using mobile-based apps.},

 abstract = {Background: Targeting low self-esteem in youth exposed to childhood
adversity is a promising strategy for preventing adult mental disorder,
but psychological help remains difficult to access and accept for youth,
calling for novel, youth-friendly approaches. Mobile Health (mHealth)
and, most prominently, ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) provide
a unique opportunity to deliver youth-friendly, personalized, real-time,
guided self-help interventions. The aim of this study is to investigate
the efficacy of a novel, accessible, transdiagnostic ecological
momentary intervention for improving self-esteem ('SELFIE') in youth
with prior exposure to childhood adversity.
Methods/design: In a parallel-group, assessor-blind, multi-center
randomized controlled trial, individuals aged 12-26 years with prior
exposure to childhood adversity and low self-esteem will be randomly
allocated to SELFIE in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) as the
experimental condition or the control condition of TAU only, which will
include access to all standard health care. SELFIE is a digital guided
self-help intervention administered through a smartphone-based app to
allow for interactive, personalized, real-time and real-world transfer
of intervention components in individuals' daily lives, blended with
three training sessions delivered by trained mental health professionals
over a 6-week period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline,
post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up by blinded assessors. The
primary outcome will be the level of self-esteem as measured with the
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).
Discussion: The current study is the first to establish the efficacy of
an EMI focusing on improving self-esteem transdiagnostically in youth
exposed to childhood adversity. If this trial provides evidence on the
efficacy of SELFIE, it has significant potential to contribute to
minimizing the deleterious impact of childhood adversity and, thereby,
preventing the development of mental disorder later in life.},

 abstract = {Background: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer demonstrate
suboptimal oral chemotherapy adherence, increasing their risk of cancer
relapse. It is unclear how everyday time-varying contextual factors (eg,
mood) affect their adherence, stalling the development of personalized
mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Poor engagement is also a
challenge across mHealth trials; an effective adherence intervention
must be engaging to promote uptake.
Objective: This protocol aims to determine the temporal associations
between daily contextual factors and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) adherence
and explore the proximal impact of various engagement strategies on
ecological momentary assessment survey completion.
Methods: At the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, AYAs with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma who are prescribed prolonged
maintenance chemotherapy that includes daily oral 6-MP are eligible,
along with their matched caregivers. Participants will use an ecological
momentary assessment app called ADAPTS (Adherence Assessments and
Personalized Timely Support)-a version of an open-source app that was
modified for AYAs with cancer through a user-centered process-and
complete surveys in bursts over 6 months. Theory-informed engagement
strategies will be microrandomized to estimate the causal effects on
proximal survey completion.
Results: With funding from the National Cancer Institute and
institutional review board approval, of the proposed 30 AYA-caregiver
dyads, 60\% (18/30) have been enrolled; of the 18 enrolled, 15 (83\%)
have completed the study so far.
Conclusions: This protocol represents an important first step toward
prescreening tailoring variables and engagement components for a
just-in-time adaptive intervention designed to promote both 6-MP
adherence and mHealth engagement.},

 abstract = {Objective: To describe and assess digital health-led diabetes
self-management education and support (DSMES) effectiveness in improving
glycosylated hemoglobin, diabetes knowledge, and health-related quality
of life (HrQoL) of Type 1 and 2 Diabetes in the past 10 years.
Design: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. The protocol was registered
on PROSPERO registration number CRD42019139884.
Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and
Scopus between January 2010 and August 2019.
Study Selection and Appraisal: Randomized control trials of digital
health-led DSMES for Type 1 (T1DM) or 2 (T2DM) diabetes compared to
usual care were included. Outcomes were change in HbA1c, diabetes
knowledge, and HrQoL. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was used to assess
bias and GRADEpro for overall quality. The analysis involved narrative
synthesis, subgroup and pooled meta-analyses.
Results: From 4286 articles, 39 studies (6861 participants) were
included. Mean age was 51.62 years, range (13-70). Meta-analysis
revealed intervention effects on HbA1c for T2DM with difference in means
(MD) from baseline -0.480\% (-0.661,-0.299), I-2 75\% (6
months),-0.457\% (-0.761,-0.151), I-2 81\% (12 months), and for
T1DM-0.41\% (-1.022, 0.208) I-2 83\% (6 months),-0.03\% (-0.210, 0.142)
I-2 0\% (12 months). Few reported HrQoL with Hedges' g 0.183 (-0.039,
0.405), I-2 0\% (6 months), 0.153 (-0.060, 0.366), I-2 0\% (12 months)
and diabetes knowledge with Hedges' g 1.003 (0.068, 1.938), I-2 87\% (3
months).
Conclusion: Digital health-led DSMES are effective in improving HbA1c
and diabetes knowledge, notably for T2DM. Research shows non-significant
changes in HrQoL. Intervention effect on HbA1c was more impressive if
delivered through mobile apps or patient portals. Further research is
needed on the impact of DSMES on these outcomes, especially for newly
diagnosed diabetes patients. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Background Occupational stress is a major public health challenge that
requires a variety of evidence-based preventative approaches to increase
their reach within the working population. Behavioral stress management
interventions are considered an established approach for occupational
stress prevention. Both in-person group-based stress management training
(gSMT) and individual Internet-based training (iSMT) have been shown to
be effective at reducing stress in employees. However, there remains a
lack of evidence on the comparative efficacy of the newer digital format
compared to well-established, in-person, group-based training. This
study aims (1) to directly compare an evidence-based iSMT with an
established gSMT on stress in employees, (2) to analyze the two
conditions from a cost perspective, and (3) to explore moderators of the
comparative efficacy. Methods In a randomized, controlled,
non-inferiority trial employees from the general working population will
be allocated to iSMT or gSMT. The primary outcome will be perceived
stress, assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale, three months after
randomization. The non-inferiority margin for the primary outcome
measure will be set at 2 points (Cohen's d = 0.29). This trial will also
compare the two interventions from a health economics perspective, and
conduct explorative analyses to identify potential effect moderators.
Discussion To reach a larger proportion of the working population,
well-established gSMT should be complemented with interventions that fit
today's society's increasingly digital lifestyle. The current trial will
provide evidence supporting the responsible implementation of
Internet-based stress management training if the digital format proves
to at least be non-inferior to established group-based training.
Additional explorative moderator analyses may guide future practices to
aid in matching select programs with select users.},

 abstract = {Background: Multimorbidity is defined as the presence of two or more
chronic diseases and associated comorbidities. There is a need to
improve best practices around the provision of well-coordinated,
person-centered care for persons with multimorbidities. Present health
systems across the European Union (EU) focus on supporting a
single-disease framework of care; the primary challenge is to create a
patient-centric, integrated care ecosystem to understand and manage
multimorbidity. ProACT is a large-scale project funded by the European
Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme, that involved the design,
development, and evaluation of a digital health platform to improve and
advance home-based integrated care, and supported self-management, for
older adults (aged >= 65 years) living with multimorbidity.
Objective: This paper describes the trial implementation protocol of a
proof-of-concept digital health platform (ProACT) in 2 EU member states
(Ireland and Belgium) to support older persons with multimorbidities
self-managing at home, supported by their care network (CN).
Methods: Research was conducted across 2 EU member states, Ireland and
Belgium. A 12-month action research trial design, divided into 3
evaluation cycles and lasting 3 months each, with a reflective redesign
and development phase of 1 month after cycles 1 and 2 was conducted.
Participants were 120 (60/120, 50\% in Ireland and 60/120, 50\% in
Belgium) older persons with multimorbidities diagnosed with two or more
of the following chronic conditions: diabetes, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, and cardiovascular diseases.
With permission from persons with multimorbidities, members of their CN
were invited to participate in the study. Persons with multimorbidities
were provided with ProACT technologies (tablet, devices, or sensors) to
support them in self-managing their conditions. CN members also received
access to an app to remotely support their persons with multimorbidity.
Qualitative and quantitative feedback and evaluation data from persons
with multimorbidity and CN participants were collected across four time
points: baseline (T1), at the end of each 3-month action research cycle
(T2 and T3), and in a final posttrial interview (T4). Thematic analysis
was used to analyze the qualitative interview data. Quantitative data
were analyzed via platform use statistics (to assess engagement) and
standardized questionnaires (using descriptive and inferential
statistics). This study is approved by the ethics committees of Ireland
and Belgium.
Results: The trial implementation phase for this 44-month (2016-2019)
funded study was April 2018 to June 2019. The trial outcomes are at
various stages of publication since 2021.
Conclusions: ProACT aims to co-design and develop a digital intervention
with persons with multimorbidities and their CN, incorporating clinical
guidelines with the state of the art in human-computer interaction,
behavioral science, health psychology, and data analytic methods to
deliver a digital health platform to advance self-management of
multimorbidity at home, as part of a proactive, integrated model of
supported person-centered care.},

 abstract = {Background: Acquired brain injuries (ABIs) commonly cause
cognitive-communication disorders, which can have a pervasive
psychosocial impact on a person's life. More than 135 million people
worldwide currently live with ABI, and this large and growing burden is
increasingly surpassing global rehabilitation service capacity. A
web-based service delivery model may offer a scalable solution. The
Social Brain Toolkit is an evidence-based suite of 3 web-based
communication training interventions for people with ABI and their
communication partners. Successful real-world delivery of web-based
interventions such as the Social Brain Toolkit requires investigation of
intervention implementation in addition to efficacy and effectiveness.
Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the implementation
and effectiveness of the Social Brain Toolkit as a web-based service
delivery model.
Methods: This is a mixed methods, prospective, hybrid type 2
implementation-effectiveness study, theoretically underpinned by the
Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS)
framework of digital health implementation. We will document
implementation strategies preemptively deployed to support the launch of
the Social Brain Toolkit interventions, as well as implementation
strategies identified by end users through formative evaluation of the
Social Brain Toolkit. We will prospectively observe implementation
outcomes, selected on the basis of the NASSS framework, through
quantitative web analytics of intervention use, qualitative and
quantitative pre-and postintervention survey data from all users within
a specified sample frame, and qualitative interviews with a subset of
users of each intervention. Qualitative implementation data will be
deductively analyzed against the NASSS framework. Quantitative
implementation data will be analyzed descriptively. We will obtain
effectiveness outcomes through web-based knowledge tests, custom user
questionnaires, and formal clinical tools. Quantitative effectiveness
outcomes will be analyzed through descriptive statistics and the
Reliable Change Index, with repeated analysis of variance (pretraining,
posttraining, and follow-up), to determine whether there is any
significant improvement within this participant sample.
Results: Data collection commenced on July 2, 2021, and is expected to
conclude on June 1, 2022, after a 6-month sample frame of analytics for
each Social Brain Toolkit intervention. Data analysis will occur
concurrently with data collection until mid-2022, with results expected
for publication late 2022 and early 2023.
Conclusions: End-user evaluation of the Social Brain Toolkit's
implementation can guide intervention development and implementation to
reach and meet community needs in a feasible, scalable, sustainable, and
acceptable manner. End user feedback will be directly incorporated and
addressed wherever possible in the next version of the Social Brain
Toolkit. Learnings from these findings will benefit the implementation
of this and future web-based psychosocial interventions for people with
ABI and other populations.},

 abstract = {Background: CUIDA-TE is an APP that offers transdiagnostic cognitive
behavioral therapy focused on enhancing emotion regulation. As a
novelty, it incorporates ecological momentary interventions (EMI), which
can provide psychological support in real time, when suffering arises.
The main goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CUIDA-TE to
improve emotion regulation in healthcare workers, a population that has
been particularly emotionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods: In this three-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT) the study
sample will be composed of a minimum of 174 healthcare workers. They
will be randomly assigned to a 2-month EMI group (CUIDA-TE APP, n >=
58), a 2-month ecological momentary assessment (EMA) only group (MONITOR
EMOCIONAL APP, n >= 58), or a wait-list control group (no daily
monitoring nor intervention, n >= 58). CUIDA-TE will provide EMI if EMA
reveals emotional problems, poor sleep quality/quantity, burnout,
stress, or low perceived self-efficacy when regulating emotions.
Depression will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include
emotion regulation, quality of life, and resilience. Treatment
acceptance and usability will also be measured. Primary and secondary
outcomes will be obtained at pre- and post-intervention measurements,
and at the 3-month follow-up for all groups.
Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT that evaluates the
efficacy of an APP-based EMI to improve emotion regulation skills in
healthcare workers. This type of intervention might ultimately help
disseminate treatments and reach a larger number of individuals than
traditional face-to-face individual therapies.},

 abstract = {Background This study reviews the evidence on ecological momentary
interventions (EMIs) for managing and preventing suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Methods This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Its protocol was
registered in the PROSPERO database. We conducted a systematic
literature search of five databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science,
PsycInfo, and Cochrane library. The most recent search date was 10
September 2021. Results After screening and full-text review, 27 studies
were included, totaling 19 different interventions. Many of the
available interventions have not yet been clinically tested. Those that
have undergone effectiveness evaluation (10 interventions) showed good
rates of effectiveness and feasibility, with some exceptions. The most
widely used intervention model is the safety plan, which allows the user
to implement coping and distracting strategies in case of suicidal
ideation. Conclusions Ecological momentary interventions provide certain
advantages, such as their wide availability, versatility, and potential
for customization. These interventions can be useful complements to
traditional care, especially in situations in which face-to-face care is
not possible. Evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions is
still scarce. Furthermore, barriers limiting implementation in clinical
practice remain. The constant advance of technology means that these
interventions have great potential for improvement in the coming years.},

 abstract = {Background: Thorough holistic development of eHealth can contribute to a
good fit among the technology, its users, and the context. However,
despite the availability of frameworks, not much is known about specific
research activities for different aims, phases, and settings. This
results in researchers having to reinvent the wheel. Consequently, there
is a need to synthesize existing knowledge on research activities for
participatory eHealth development processes.
Objective: The 3 main goals of this review are to create an overview of
the development strategies used in studies based on the CeHRes (Center
for eHealth Research) Roadmap, create an overview of the goals for which
these methods can be used, and provide insight into the lessons learned
about these methods.
Methods: We included eHealth development studies that were based on the
phases and/or principles of the CeHRes Roadmap. This framework was
selected because of its focus on participatory, iterative eHealth design
in context and to limit the scope of this review. Data were extracted
about the type of strategy used, rationale for using the strategy,
research questions, and reported information on lessons learned. The
most frequently mentioned lessons learned were summarized using a
narrative, inductive approach.
Results: In the included 160 papers, a distinction was made between
overarching development methods (n=10) and products (n=7). Methods are
used to gather new data, whereas products can be used to synthesize
previously collected data and support the collection of new data. The
identified methods were focus groups, interviews, questionnaires,
usability tests, literature studies, desk research, log data analyses,
card sorting, Delphi studies, and experience sampling. The identified
products were prototypes, requirements, stakeholder maps, values,
behavior change strategies, personas, and business models. Examples of
how these methods and products were applied in the development process
and information about lessons learned were provided.
Conclusions: This study shows that there is a plethora of methods and
products that can be used at different points in the development process
and in different settings. To do justice to the complexity of eHealth
development, it seems that multiple strategies should be combined. In
addition, we found no evidence for an optimal single step-by-step
approach to develop eHealth. Rather, researchers need to select the most
suitable research methods for their research objectives, the context in
which data are collected, and the characteristics of the participants.
This study serves as a first step toward creating a toolkit to support
researchers in applying the CeHRes Roadmap to practice. In this way,
they can shape the most suitable and efficient eHealth development
process.},

 abstract = {Background: The ever-increasing pressure on health care systems has
resulted in the underrecognition of perinatal mental disorders. Digital
mental health tools such as apps could provide an option for accessible
perinatal mental health screening and assessment. However, there is a
lack of information regarding the availability and features of perinatal
app options. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the current state of
diagnostic and screening apps for perinatal mental health available on
the Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS) and to review
their features following the mHealth Index and Navigation Database
framework. Methods: Following a scoping review approach, the Apple App
Store and Google Play Store were systematically searched to identify
perinatal mental health assessment apps. A total of 14 apps that met the
inclusion criteria were downloaded and reviewed in a standardized manner
using the mHealth Index and Navigation Database framework. The framework
comprised 107 questions, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of app
origin, functionality, engagement features, security, and clinical use.
Results: Most apps were developed by for-profit companies (n=10),
followed by private individuals (n=2) and trusted health care companies
(n=2). Out of the 14 apps, 3 were available only on Android devices, 4
were available only on iOS devices, and 7 were available on both
platforms. Approximately one-third of the apps (n=5) had been updated
within the last 180 days. A total of 12 apps offered the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale in its original version or in rephrased
versions. Engagement, input, and output features included reminder
notifications, connections to therapists, and free writing features. A
total of 6 apps offered psychoeducational information and references.
Privacy policies were available for 11 of the 14 apps, with a median
Flesch-Kincaid reading grade level of 12.3. One app claimed to be
compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
standards and 2 apps claimed to be compliant with General Data
Protection Regulation. Of the apps that could be accessed in full
(n=10), all appeared to fulfill the claims stated in their description.
Only 1 app referenced a relevant peer-reviewed study. All the apps
provided a warning for use, highlighting that the mental health
assessment result should not be interpreted as a diagnosis or as a
substitute for medical care. Only 3 apps allowed users to export or
email their mental health test results. Conclusions: These results
indicate that there are opportunities to improve perinatal mental health
assessment apps. To this end, we recommend focusing on the development
and validation of more comprehensive assessment tools, ensuring data
protection and safety features are adequate for the intended app use,
and improving data sharing features between users and health care
professionals for timely support.},

 abstract = {Background: The use of video games, a hobby for many teenagers in their
leisure time, has brought with it a new potential for concerns. Internet
gaming disorder (IGD) is a mental condition classified as a disorder due
to addictive behaviors. It may include use of video games, both online
and offline. Consequences of IGD may include introversion, social
anxiety, mood swings, loneliness, sleep problems, behavioral problems,
depression, low self-esteem, and increased violence. In order to design
an app-based intervention for adolescents, a transtheoretical model
(TTM) has been used. This widely used model in the field of behavioral
change is also practical for health education programs. In addition,
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used to make people more
aware of their behaviors, feelings and thoughts and how to achieve
behavioral change. The present study seeks to determine the
effectiveness of this app-based intervention in in the treatment of IGD
among adolescents.
Method: In this single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, 206
high-school adolescents aged 13 to 18 years in Qazvin city will be
recruited. Eligible adolescents will be randomly assigned into
intervention and control groups. Eight consecutive sessions delivered
over 2 months and based on the TTM and CBT will be delivered through the
`app (named HAPPYTEEN) to the intervention group. The control group will
receive a sleep hygiene intervention (8 consecutive sessions for 2
months) via the app. Data collection tools include the Internet Gaming
Disorder Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress
Scales, Stages of Change Questionnaire, Decision Balance, and
Self-Efficacy. The study measures will be completed at baseline, post
intervention, and 1 month and 3 months after the intervention.
Discussion: The results of this intervention could be used as adjunct
therapy for adolescents with IGD.},

 abstract = {Background: Workplace-related stress is a major risk factor for mental
and physical health problems and related sickness absence and
productivity loss. Despite evidence regarding the effectiveness of
different workplace-based interventions, the implementation of stress
prevention interventions is rare, especially in micro and small-sized
enterprises (MSE) with fewer than 50 employees. The joint research
project ``PragmatiKK{''}+ aims to identify and address the specific
barriers to the implementation of stress prevention interventions in
MSE. This study protocol describes a mixed method study design to
evaluate the effectiveness of adapted stress prevention interventions
and the implementation process via an integrated web-based platform
({''}System P{''}) specifically targeted at MSE.
Methods: First, we develop a web-based intervention, which accounts for
the specific working conditions in MSE and addresses stress prevention
at a structural and behavioral level. Second, we use common methods of
implementation research to perform an effect and process evaluation. We
analyze the effectiveness of the web-based stress prevention
interventions by comparing depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up
(after 6 months and 12 months). Indicators for a successful
implementation process include acceptability, adoption, feasibility,
reach, dose, and fidelity, which we will measure with quantitative
web-based questionnaires and qualitative interviews. We will also
analyze the accumulated usage data from the web-based platform.
Discussion: Collecting data on the implementation process and the
effectiveness of a web-based intervention will help to identify and
overcome common barriers to stress prevention in MSE. This can improve
the mental health of L employees in MSE, which constitute more than 90\%
of all enterprises in Germany.

 abstract = {Background: There are multiple health benefits from participating in
physical activity after a cancer diagnosis, but many people living with
and beyond cancer (LWBC) are not meeting physical activity guidelines.
App-based interventions offer a promising platform for intervention
delivery. This trial aims to pilot a theory-driven, app-based
intervention that promotes brisk walking among people living with and
beyond cancer. The primary aim is to investigate the feasibility and
acceptability of study procedures before conducting a larger randomised
controlled trial (RCT).
Methods: This is an individually randomised, two-armed pilot RCT.
Patients with localised or metastatic breast, prostate, or colorectal
cancer, who are aged 16 years or over, will be recruited from a single
hospital site in South Yorkshire in the UK. The intervention includes an
app designed to encourage brisk walking (Active 10) supplemented with
habit-based behavioural support in the form of two brief telephone/video
calls, an information leaflet, and walking planners. The primary
outcomes will be feasibility and acceptability of the study procedures.
Demographic and medical characteristics will be collected at baseline,
through self-report and hospital records. Secondary outcomes for the
pilot (assessed at 0 and 3 months) will be accelerometer measured and
self-reported physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and waist
circumference, and patient-reported outcomes of quality of life,
fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and habit strength
for walking. Qualitative interviews will explore experiences of
participating or reasons for declining to participate. Parameters for
the intended primary outcome measure (accelerometer measured average
daily minutes of brisk walking (>= 100 steps/min)) will inform a sample
size calculation for the future RCT and a preliminary economic
evaluation will be conducted.
Discussion: This pilot study will inform the design of a larger RCT to
investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this intervention in
people LWBC.},

 abstract = {The skin cancer incidence rate has been rising, and digital health
interventions can promote skin cancer prevention and detection
behaviors. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the outcomes
of digital interventions that promote sun protection and skin
self-examination (SSE). This review examined studies that utilized
randomized controlled designs or quasi-experiments, included outcomes
related to sun safety or SSE, employed at least one digital platform,
and were published in English from January 2000 to October 2020. A total
of 62 studies were included in the review. Digital modalities included
web-based (e.g., websites) alone (n = 29), mobile-based (e.g., mobile
apps) alone (n = 12), game-based (n = 1), emails or text messages alone
(n = 8), videos alone (n = 6), social media (n = 3), both text messages
and mobile apps (n = 2), or both text messages and video (n = 1). Most
studies (n = 44) only evaluated sun protection-related outcomes, seven
studies assessed SSE outcomes only, nine studies examined both, and two
assessed other related outcomes. Digital interventions are effective
compared to non-intervention control conditions in promoting sun safety
or SSE. Almost all studies found digital interventions to be equally or
more effective compared to non-digital interventions. This review
suggests that although the digital interventions varied, they showed
promising effects on improving sun protection or SSE outcomes. Future
research should include more sophisticated phase-based and rigorous
longitudinal research designs, additional investigation of social media
and other newer technologies, as well as more detailed reporting of
methods and results.},

@article{WOS:000796430500024,
 abstract = {Background: Osteoporosis is the fourth most common chronic disease
worldwide. The adoption of preventative measures and effective
self-management interventions can help improve bone health. Mobile
health (mHealth) technologies can play a key role in the care and
self-management of patients with osteoporosis.
Objective: This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of
the currently available mHealth apps targeting osteoporosis
self-management, aiming to determine the current status, gaps, and
challenges that future research could address, as well as propose
appropriate recommendations.
Methods: A systematic review of all English articles was conducted, in
addition to a survey of all apps available in iOS and Android app stores
as of May 2021. A comprehensive literature search (2010 to May 2021) of
PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore was conducted.
Articles were included if they described apps dedicated to or useful for
osteoporosis (targeting self-management, nutrition, physical activity,
and risk assessment) delivered on smartphone devices for adults aged >=
18 years. Of the 32 articles, a random effects meta-analysis was
performed on 13 (41\%) studies of randomized controlled trials, whereas
the 19 (59\%) remaining studies were only included in the narrative
synthesis as they did not provide enough data.
Results: In total, 3906 unique articles were identified. Of these 3906
articles, 32 (0.81\%) articles met the inclusion criteria and were
reviewed in depth. The 32 studies comprised 14,235 participants, of
whom, on average, 69.5\% (n=9893) were female, with a mean age of 49.8
(SD 17.8) years. The app search identified 23 relevant apps for
osteoporosis self-management. The meta-analysis revealed that
mHealth-supported interventions resulted in a significant reduction in
pain (Hedges g -1.09, 95\% CI -1.68 to -0.45) and disability (Hedges g
-0.77, 95\% CI -1.59 to 0.05). The posttreatment effect of the digital
intervention was significant for physical function (Hedges g 2.54, 95\%
CI -4.08 to 4.08) but nonsignificant for well-being (Hedges g 0.17, 95\%
CI -1.84 to 2.17), physical activity (Hedges g 0.09, 95\% CI -0.59 to
0.50), anxiety (Hedges g -0.29, 95\% CI -6.11 to 5.53), fatigue (Hedges
g -0.34, 95\% CI -5.84 to 5.16), calcium (Hedges g -0.05, 95\% CI -0.59
to 0.50), vitamin D intake (Hedges g 0.10, 95\% CI -4.05 to 4.26), and
trabecular score (Hedges g 0.06, 95\% CI -1.00 to 1.12).
Conclusions: Osteoporosis apps have the potential to support and improve
the management of the disease and its symptoms; they also appear to be
valuable tools for patients and health professionals. However, most of
the apps that are currently available lack clinically validated evidence
of their efficacy and focus on a limited number of symptoms. A more
holistic and personalized approach within a cocreation design ecosystem
is needed.},

 abstract = {Background: Elderly population in low- and middle-income countries is
rapidly growing, which indicates an increase in the number of dependent
people needing long-term care. Caring for the elderly is difficult and
stressful and threatens physical and mental health of informal
caregivers. We aim to design a web-based support group and assess its
effectiveness on depression, anxiety, and stress among elderly informal
caregivers.
Methods: This is a protocol for a two-arm randomized controlled trial. A
total of 160 informal elderly caregivers will be recruited from the
southern area of Tehran. Eligible participants will be randomly
allocated to two intervention and control groups. The inclusion criteria
include not receiving salary for caring, having primary responsibility
for care, having smartphone/tablet/computer, being able to use the
contents and web applications, having at least one month of experience
in caring for the elderly, and having access to the Internet at least
once weekly. The intervention will be implemented by giving an account
access to the designed website. Depression, anxiety, and stress will be
assessed using the DASS21 questionnaire at baseline, and at the end of
third and sixth months.
Discussion: Our findings can pave the way for improving the mental
health of informal caregivers of the elderly through provision of
web-based supportive services. This study stands as an opportunity to
address the needs of caregivers and help them support each other in a
novel way.},

 abstract = {Background: The literature reveals that borderline personality disorder
(BPD) is an important public mental health problem that affects both the
patients and their families. Moreover, studies indicate a high
prevalence of psychological symptoms and burden in relatives of people
with BPD. Therefore, it is necessary to develop useful and accessible
interventions specifically addressed to the caregivers. Smartphone
interventions with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Ecological
Momentary Interventions (EMI) offer several potential advantages in this
regard. The aims of our study are to test the effectiveness of a
combined intervention supported by a smartphone app versus the same
intervention supported by a paper-based manual, studying the feasibility
and acceptance of both conditions and evaluating the perceptions and
opinions of families about both interventions. This paper contains the
study protocol.
Method: The design of this study protocol is a randomized controlled
trial. A minimum of 116 relatives will be randomly assigned to two
conditions: Treatment as usual (TAU) (N = 58) or Treatment as usual +
EMI (TAU+EMI) (N = 58), with TAU being the Family Connection program.
The primary outcome will be the Burden Assessment Scale. Secondary
outcomes will include psychological symptoms, mastery and empowerment,
and resilience. Outcomes will be assessed from pre-treatment to
post-treatment (3 months). Statistical analyses will be performed using
Student's t-tests, mixed models (ANCOVA) and intention-to-treat
analysis.
Discussion: The results of this study will provide a basis for future
EMA- and EMI-based application interventions for family members of
people with BPD and family members of people with other mental disorders
who could benefit from the skills taught.},

 abstract = {Background: Data that can be easily, efficiently, and safely collected
via cell phones and other digital devices have great potential for
clinical application. Here, we focus on how these data could be used to
refine and augment intervention strategies for binge eating disorder
(BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN), conditions that lack highly efficacious,
enduring, and accessible treatments. These data are easy to collect
digitally but are highly complex and present unique methodological
challenges that invite innovative solutions.
Objective: We describe the digital phenotyping component of the Binge
Eating Genetics Initiative, which uses personal digital device data to
capture dynamic patterns of risk for binge and purge episodes.
Characteristic data signatures will ultimately be used to develop
personalized models of eating disorder pathologies and just-in-time
interventions to reduce risk for related behaviors. Here, we focus on
the methods used to prepare the data for analysis and discuss how these
approaches can be generalized beyond the current application.
Methods: The University of North Carolina Biomedical Institutional
Review Board approved all study procedures. Participants who met
diagnostic criteria for BED or BN provided real time assessments of
eating behaviors and feelings through the Recovery Record app delivered
on iPhones and the Apple Watches. Continuous passive measures of
physiological activation (heart rate) and physical activity (step count)
were collected from Apple Watches over 30 days. Data were cleaned to
account for user and device recording errors, including duplicate
entries and unreliable heart rate and step values. Across participants,
the proportion of data points removed during cleaning ranged from <0.1\%
to 2.4\%, depending on the data source. To prepare the data for
multivariate time series analysis, we used a novel data handling
approach to address variable measurement frequency across data sources
and devices. This involved mapping heart rate, step count, feeling
ratings, and eating disorder behaviors onto simultaneous minute-level
time series that will enable the characterization of individual-and
group-level regulatory dynamics preceding and following binge and purge
episodes.
Results: Data collection and cleaning are complete. Between August 2017
and May 2021, 1019 participants provided an average of 25 days of data
yielding 3,419,937 heart rate values, 1,635,993 step counts, 8274 binge
or purge events, and 85,200 feeling observations. Analysis will begin in
spring 2022.
Conclusions: We provide a detailed description of the methods used to
collect, clean, and prepare personal digital device data from one
component of a large, longitudinal eating disorder study. The results
will identify digital signatures of increased risk for binge and purge
events, which may ultimately be used to create digital interventions for
BED and BN. Our goal is to contribute to increased transparency in the
handling and analysis of personal digital device data.

@article{WOS:000832961700005,
 abstract = {Background: The incidence of mental health disorders in Canada is
increasing with costs of CAD \$51 billion (US \$40 billion) per year.
Depression is the most prevalent cause of disability while cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best validated behavioral depression
treatment. CBT, when combined with mindfulness meditation (CBT-M), has
strong evidence for increased efficacy. While randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) have demonstrated online CBT-M efficacy, comparisons with
in-office delivery are lacking.
Objective: The aim of this research is to assess whether online group
CBT-M (with standard psychiatric care) is non-inferior in efficacy and
more cost-effective than office-based, on-site group CBT-M at
post-intervention and 6-months follow-up in major depressive disorder.
The study will also assess whether digitally recorded data (ie, online
workbooks completed, Fitbit step count, and online text messages)
predict depression symptom reduction in online participants.
Methods: This single-center, two-arm, noninferiority RCT employs
assessor-blinded and self-report outcomes and economic evaluation. The
research site is the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto), a
research-based psychiatry institution where participants will be
identified from service wait lists and through contacts with other
Toronto clinics. Inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) aged 18-60
years, any ethnicity; (2) Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) of mild
severity (score =14) with no upper severity limit; (3)
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-confirmed, psychiatric
major depressive disorder diagnosis; (4) fluent in English. All patients
are diagnosed by staff psychiatrists. Exclusion criteria are as follows:
(1) receipt of weekly structured psychotherapy; (2) observation of
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition)
criteria for severe alcohol or substance use disorder (in past 3
months), borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia (or other
primary psychotic disorder), bipolar disorder, or obsessive-compulsive
disorder; (3) clinically significant suicidal ideation (imminent intent
or attempted suicide in the past 6 months); and (4) treatment-resistant
depression. All participants receive standard psychiatric care,
experimental participants receive online group CBT-M, and controls
receive standard care in-office group CBT-M. The online group program
(in collaboration with NexJ Health, Inc) combines smartphone and
computer-accessed workbooks with mental health phone counselling (16
hours in 16 weeks) that coordinates software interactions (eg, secure
text messaging and Fitbit-tracked walking). The primary outcome is
BDI-II, and secondary outcomes are anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory),
depression (ie, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and 17-item
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness
Questionnaire), quality of life (European Quality of Life Five
Dimension), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory).
Results: Based on prior studies with the BDI-II and 80\% power to reject
an inferiority hypothesis with a 1-sided type I error rate of 5\%, a
sample of 78 per group is adequate to detect small-to-medium-effect
sizes.
Conclusions: This study assesses online CBT-M efficacy and
noninferiority in relation to in-person CBT, and the cost-effectiveness
of both interventions.},

@article{WOS:000836294100025,
 abstract = {Background: Black smokers have greater difficulty in quitting and higher
rates of smoking-related diseases and disabilities than the general
population. The smoking disparities experienced by this group are, in
part, a consequence of multiple chronic life stressors (eg, racial
discrimination) that engender increased exposure to interoceptive stress
symptoms (eg, anxiety), which can ultimately lead to smoking as a means
of immediate emotion regulation.
Objective: This study aimed to culturally adapt and initially test a
novel mobile intervention (ie, Mobile Anxiety Sensitivity Program for
Smoking {[}MASP]) that targets anxiety sensitivity (AS; a proxy for
difficulty and responsivity to interoceptive stress) among Black
smokers. The MASP intervention is culturally informed to address
interoceptive stress management difficulties among Black smokers and is
thus hypothesized to facilitate smoking cessation.
Methods: In phase 1, a total of 25 Black smokers with elevated AS will
be administered MASP for 6 weeks. Following the completion of phase 1,
we will further refine the MASP based on qualitative and quantitative
data from participants to produce the final MASP iteration. In phase 2,
a total of 200 Black smokers with elevated AS will be enrolled and
randomly assigned to receive nicotine replacement therapy and either the
smartphone-based National Cancer Institute QuitGuide app for standard
mobile smoking cessation treatment or the MASP intervention. All
participants in phases 1 and 2 will be enrolled remotely and will
complete a web-based study screener; smartphone-based baseline
assessment; daily smartphone-based ecological momentary assessments for
6 weeks; phone-based end-of-treatment qualitative interviews; and
smartphone-based follow-up assessments at postbaseline weeks 1, 2 (quit
date), 3, 4, 5, 6, 28, and 54 (weeks 28 and 54 follow-ups will be
completed by phase 2 participants only). The MASP intervention is
intended to offset barriers to treatment and encourage treatment
engagement via smartphones.
Results: This project was funded in September 2020. Phase 1 data
collection began in January 2022. Phase 2 data collection is scheduled
to begin in July 2022.
Conclusions: If successful, data from this study will support culturally
informed treatment approaches for Black smokers and, pending findings of
efficacy, provide an evidence-based mobile intervention for smoking
cessation that is ready for dissemination and implementation.},

 abstract = {Background The adoption of a healthy lifestyle plays a crucial role for
the health and well-being of health care professionals. Previous e- and
mHealth interventions relied on deliberative psychological processes
(e.g., intention, planning) to target lifestyle changes, while revealing
mixed efficacy. The additional potential of non-deliberative, automatic
processes (i.e., habits) for behavior change has been understudied in
interventions so far. The Habit Coach mHealth intervention combines
deliberative and non-deliberative processes to support health care
professionals in forming healthy physical activity, nutrition and
mindfulness habits in daily life. The aim of this paper is to outline
the study protocol including a detailed description of the mHealth
intervention, evaluation plan, and study design. The purpose of this
trial is to understand healthy habit formation in health care
professionals over time. Methods A one-arm, multicenter mHealth
intervention study will be conducted. Behavioral and psychosocial
predictors will be collected via within-app questionnaires across a
100-day period at baseline, post, as well as at weekly assessments. To
understand habit formation across time, linear mixed models will be
used. Discussion This trial aims to unravel the role of motivational and
volitional determinants for healthy habit formation across multiple
health behaviors in health care professionals embedded in a mHealth
intervention.},

is strongly associated with reduced success. A substantial proportion of
lapses are due to urges to smoke triggered by situational cues.
Currently, no available interventions proactively respond to such cues
in real time. Quit Sense is a theory-guided just-in-time adaptive
intervention smartphone app that uses a learning tool and smartphone
sensing to provide in-the-moment tailored support to help smokers manage
cue-induced urges to smoke. The primary aim of this randomised
controlled trial (RCT) is to assess the feasibility of delivering a
definitive online efficacy trial of Quit Sense.Methods and analysesA
two-arm parallel-group RCT allocating smokers willing to make a quit
attempt, recruited via online adverts, to usual care (referral to the
NHS SmokeFree website) or usual care plus Quit Sense. Randomisation will
be stratified by smoking rate (<16vs <greater than or equal to>16
cigarettes/day) and socioeconomic status (low vs high). Recruitment,
enrolment, baseline data collection, allocation and intervention
delivery will be automated through the study website. Outcomes will be
collected at 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up via the study website or
telephone, and during app usage. The study aims to recruit 200 smokers
to estimate key feasibility outcomes, the preliminary impact of Quit
Sense and potential cost-effectiveness, in addition to gaining insights
on user views of the app through qualitative interviews.Ethics and

 abstract = {Background: Depression and anxiety are common among pregnant women.
Internet-delivered psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral
therapy (iCBT) have been developed to increase accessibility and address
common help-seeking barriers, especially during pandemic period.The
objective of this trial is to evaluate the short-term and long-term
effects of iCBT on reducing depressive symptoms among pregnant women
during the COVID-19 pandemic with the overall goal of preventing
depression recurrence in the first 12 months postpartum.
Methods: A multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted
where 300 pregnant women early in their third trimester will be screened
for depression symptoms using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
(EPDS) during a routine obstetrical visit. Eligible and consenting women
with a score greater than 9 will be randomly allocated (1:1) to either
intervention group or control group. ICBT involving the completion of 7
weekly online modules will be delivered via a well-designed perinatal
mental healthcare app. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect
of iCBT on reducing depression symptoms among pregnant Chinese women
starting from their third trimester. The secondary objectives are to
examine the effect of iCBT on anxiety, sleep quality, social support,
parenting stress, co-parenting relationship, and infant development.
Discussion: This multi-center randomized controlled trial has been
planned in accordance with best practices in behavioral trial design.
The internet-based intervention addressed the needs of pregnant women
during a major pandemic where face-to-face therapy is not preferable.
The trial has a relatively large sample size with sufficient power to
evaluate the efficacy of iCBT intervention for the primary and secondary
outcomes. One year follow-up evaluation in the study is designed to
determine the longer-term effect of the intervention on both maternal
and infant outcomes. Although a limitation is the assessment of
depression and anxiety using self-report measures, these easily
incorporated and maternal-preferred assessments allow for real-life
scalability if the intervention is proven to be effective.
Ethics and dissemination: Ethics was approved by the institutional
review board of International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital
(GKLW2020-25). Dissemination of results will be published in
peer-reviewed academic journals and presented at scientific conferences.},

 abstract = {Introduction Suicide is one of the leading public health issues
worldwide. Mobile health can help us to combat suicide through
monitoring and treatment. The SmartCrisis V.2.0 randomised clinical
trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based
Ecological Momentary Intervention to prevent suicidal thoughts and
behaviour.
Methods and analysis The SmartCrisis V.2.0 study is a randomised
clinical trial with two parallel groups, conducted among patients with a
history of suicidal behaviour treated at five sites in France and Spain.
The intervention group will be monitored using Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) and will receive an Ecological Momentary Intervention
called `SmartSafe' in addition to their treatment as usual (TAU). TAU
will consist of mental health follow-up of the patient (scheduled
appointments with a psychiatrist) in an outpatient Suicide Prevention
programme, with predetermined clinical appointments according to the
Brief Intervention Contact recommendations (1, 2, 4, 7 and 11 weeks and
4, 6, 9 and 12 months). The control group would receive TAU and be
monitored using EMA.
Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Ethics
Committee of the University Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz. It is
expected that, in the near future, our mobile health intervention and
monitoring system can be implemented in routine clinical practice.
Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and
psychiatric congresses. Reference number EC005-21\_FJD. Participants

 abstract = {Background Applications of mobile technologies (mHealth) have the
potential to reduce health inequalities, give patients more control over
their health, and improve health care's cost-effectiveness. The
widespread use of mobile phones offers us a new way to prevent cervical
cancer. The objective of the study was to design and develop a mobile
phone application (app) that aims to conduct a behavioral intervention
for women and to evaluate the efficacy of the app-based intervention.
Methods This study involves 5 phases. In the first phase, understanding
women's perspectives will be identified using a qualitative approach
based on the I-Change model. In phase 2, the results from the
qualitative approach and requirement prioritization through providing
experts' perspectives will be done. The main outputs of this phase will
be resulted in prioritizing the main measurable effective variables of
the I-Change model. Phase 3 will be processed for the development and
psychometric of an assessment tool regarding selected constructs. In
phase 4, the App framework and content development will be performed. In
phase 5, a three-armed, parallel-design randomized controlled trial will
be conducted on women. Two hundred ten women will be randomly assigned
to three groups including two intervention groups and one control group.
The intervention groups included the following: (1) a mobile application
and (2) a digital book. The data will be evaluated using tools designed
and constructed in phase 3 of the study at baseline in 3-month follow-up
assessments. The impact of the two interventions on cervical cancer
prevention behaviors through mobile-based educational intervention will
then be evaluated. Discussion A theory-based health education program

 abstract = {Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) can increase health-promoting
behaviors and decrease health-damaging behaviors. However, MI is often
resource intensive, precluding its use with people with limited
financial or time resources. Mobile health-based versions of MI
interventions or technology-delivered adaptations of MI (TAMIs) might
increase reach.
Objective: We aimed to understand the characteristics of existing TAMIs.
We were particularly interested in the inclusion of people from
marginalized sociodemographic groups, whether the TAMI addressed
sociocontextual factors, and how behavioral and health outcomes were
reported.
Methods: We employed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews to
conduct our scoping review. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo
from January 1, 1996, to April 6, 2022, to identify studies that
described interventions incorporating MI into a mobile or electronic
health platform. For inclusion, the study was required to (1) describe
methods/outcomes of an MI intervention, (2) feature an intervention
delivered automatically via a mobile or electronic health platform, and
(3) report a behavioral or health outcome. The exclusion criteria were
(1) publication in a language other than English and (2) description of
only in-person intervention delivery (ie, no TAMI). We charted results
using Excel (Microsoft Corp).
Results: Thirty-four studies reported the use of TAMIs. Sample sizes
ranged from 10 to 2069 participants aged 13 to 70 years. Most studies
(n=27) directed interventions toward individuals engaging in behaviors
that increased chronic disease risk. Most studies (n=22) oversampled
individuals from marginalized sociodemographic groups, but few (n=3)
were designed specifically with marginalized groups in mind. TAMIs used
text messaging (n=8), web-based intervention (n=22), app + text
messaging (n=1), and web-based intervention + text messaging (n=3) as
delivery platforms. Of the 34 studies, 30 (88\%) were randomized
controlled trials reporting behavioral and health-related outcomes, 23
of which reported statistically significant improvements in targeted
behaviors with TAMI use. TAMIs improved targeted health behaviors in the
remaining 4 studies. Moreover, 11 (32\%) studies assessed TAMI
feasibility, acceptability, or satisfaction, and all rated TAMIs highly
in this regard. Among 20 studies with a disproportionately high number
of people from marginalized racial or ethnic groups compared with the
general US population, 16 (80\%) reported increased engagement in health
behaviors or better health outcomes. However, no TAMIs included elements
that addressed sociocontextual influences on behavior or health
outcomes.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that TAMIs may improve some health
promotion and disease management behaviors. However, few TAMIs were
designed specifically for people from marginalized sociodemographic
groups, and none included elements to help address sociocontextual
challenges. Research is needed to determine how TAMIs affect individual
health outcomes and how to incorporate elements that address
sociocontextual factors, and to identify the best practices for
implementing TAMIs into clinical practice.},

 abstract = {Introduction Arterial hypertension (AH) and type 2 diabetes (T2D)
represent a significant burden for the public health system, with an
exceptionally high prevalence in patients aged >= 65 years. This study
aims to test the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, and
cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring in elderly patients with AH and T2D
at the primary care level. Methods A m ulti-centre, prospective,
randomized, controlled t rial w ill be conducted. Patients a ged >= 65 y
ears with AH and T2D will be randomized in a 1:1 proportion to a mHealth
intervention or standard care group. Patients in the intervention group
will measure their blood pressure (BP) twice weekly and blood glucose
(BG) once monthly. The readings will be synchronously transmitted via a
mobile application to the telemonitoring platform, where they will be
reviewed by a general practitioner who will indicate changes in
measurement regimen or carry out a teleconsultation. The primary
endpoint will be a change in systolic BP (SBP) and glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) relative to standard care up to 12 months after inclusion.
Secondary endpoints will be a change in other observed clinical
variables, quality-of-life indexes, and costs. Expected results
Telemonitoring will be an acceptable method of care associated with
significant reductions in SBP and HbA1c levels and an increase in
quality-of-life indexes in the intervention group. However, the
cost-effectiveness threshold (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below
euro25,000/quality-adjusted life year) might not be reached. Conclusion
This study will provide new evidence for scaling up telemonitoring
network at the primary care level and modifying telemonitoring protocols
to achieve the best clinical and cost-effective outcomes.},

 abstract = {Background and aims The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has challenged
health services worldwide, with a worsening of healthcare workers'
mental health within initial pandemic hotspots. In early 2022, the
Omicron variant is spreading rapidly around the world. This study
explores the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepped-care
programme of scalable, internet-based psychological interventions for
distressed health workers on self-reported anxiety and depression
symptoms. Methods We present the study protocol for a multicentre (two
sites), parallel-group (1:1 allocation ratio), analyst-blinded,
superiority, randomised controlled trial. Healthcare workers with
psychological distress will be allocated either to care as usual only or
to care as usual plus a stepped-care programme that includes two
scalable psychological interventions developed by the World Health
Organization: A guided self-help stress management guide (Doing What
Matters in Times of Stress) and a five-session cognitive behavioural
intervention (Problem Management Plus). All participants will receive a
single-session emotional support intervention, namely psychological
first aid. We will include 212 participants. An intention-to-treat
analysis using linear mixed models will be conducted to explore the
programme's effect on anxiety and depression symptoms, as measured by
the Patient Health Questionnaire - Anxiety and Depression Scale summary
score at 21 weeks from baseline. Secondary outcomes include
post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, resilience, quality of life,
cost impact and cost-effectiveness. Conclusions This study is the first
randomised trial that combines two World Health Organization
psychological interventions tailored for health workers into one
stepped-care programme. Results will inform occupational and mental
health prevention, treatment, and recovery strategies. Registration

 abstract = {Background: In treating colorectal cancer, surgical techniques and
adjuvant treatments have advanced over the past century, but relatively
less attention has been given to improve health-related quality of life
(HRQOL). Recent studies report a significant association between cancer
recurrence and patient lifestyle after surgery, hence emphasizing the
need to assist patients to reduce this risk through appropriate
lifestyle choices. The proposed study will evaluate the effects of
digital interventions on lifestyle after surgery for colorectal cancer
using mobile applications. Methods: A randomized controlled trial design
was proposed. A total of 320 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer
aged between 20 and 70 years were to be enrolled and randomized in equal
numbers into 4 groups (3 groups assigned to different mobile
applications and a control group). Surveys that evaluate HRQOL, physical
measurements, and metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C,
triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and fat/muscle mass
measurements by abdominal computed tomography (CT), will be conducted
prior to surgery and every 6 months post-surgery for 18 months.
Statistical analysis will be used to compare the outcomes between
groups. Discussion: Results from this study could provide evidence that
easily accessible mobile applications can influence patient lifestyles.
Results showing minimal effects of such applications could also be
constructive for improving healthcare-related applications.},

 abstract = {Background Digital health solutions are a potent and complementary
interven-tion in health system strengthening to accelerate universal
access to health services. Implementing scalable, sustainable, and
integrated digital solutions in a coordinat-ed manner is necessary to
experience the benefits of digital interventions in health systems. We
sought to establish the breadth and scope of available digital health
interventions (DHIs) and their functions in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods:
We conducted a scoping review according to the Joanne Briggs
Insti-tute's reviewers manual and followed the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses -Extension for Scoping Reviews
(PRISMA-ScR) check-list and explanation. We retrieved data from the WHO
Digital Health Atlas (DHA), the WHO e-Health country profiles report of
2015, and electronic databases. The protocol has been deposited in an
open-source platform - the Open Science Frame-work at
https://osf.io/5kzq7.Results The researchers retrieved 983 digital tools
used to strengthen health sys-tems in sub-Saharan Africa over the past
10 years. We included 738 DHIs in the analysis while 245 were excluded
for not meeting the inclusion criteria. We ob-served a disproportionate
distribution of DHIs towards service delivery (81.7\%, n = 603), health
care providers (91.8\%, n = 678), and access and use of information
(84.1\%, n = 621). Fifty-three percent (53.4\%, n = 394) of the
solutions are estab-lished and 47.5\% (n = 582) were aligned to 20\% (n
= 5) of the system categories.Conclusions Sub-Saharan Africa is endowed
with digital health solutions in both numbers and distinct functions. It
is lacking in coordination, integration, scalabili-ty, sustainability,
and equitable distribution of investments in digital health. Digital
health policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa need to urgently institute
coordination mechanisms to terminate unending duplication and disjointed
vertical implemen-tations and manage solutions for scale. Central to
this would be to build digital health leadership in countries within
SSA, adopt standards and interoperability frameworks; advocate for more
investments into lagging components, and promote multi-purpose solutions
to halt the seeming ``e-chaos{''} and progress to sustainable e-health
solutions.},

 abstract = {Background: Behavior change interventions have been the focus of recent
studies, and the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of online
interventions. However, no previous studies have investigated behavior
change techniques to improve physical activity in adults with asthma
through online intervention. Methods: This double-blind clinical trial
will investigate the effectiveness of an online behavior change
intervention in increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary
behavior in adults with asthma, as well as in improving other clinical
outcomes in short and medium terms. Patients with clinically stable
moderate to severe asthma, who are physically inactive and do not have
cardiovascular and/or osteoneuromuscular impairments will be randomized
into control or intervention groups (23 in each). Both groups will carry
out an online educational program (1 h). Additionally, the intervention
group will receive weekly individual online sessions for 12 weeks of
motivation-based behavior change intervention to promote an increase in
physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior based on both
self-determination theory and transtheoretical model. The intervention
group will also receive an activity monitor with specific strategies
related to it. Both groups will be reassessed immediately after the
intervention and 6 months after that. The primary outcomes are physical
activity and sedentary behavior, which will be objectively assessed by a
triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph wGT3X-BT). Secondary outcomes are
Asthma Control Questionnaire, Incremental Step Test, Sit-To-Stand, Timed
Up-and-Go, 4-Metre Gait Speed, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire,
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Actiwatch 2,
and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Discussion: The
intervention is unprecedented and was carefully developed to joint most
characteristics and techniques of both behavioral strategies
(transtheoretical model and self-determination theory). Therefore, this
intervention has the potential to improve physical activity levels and
asthma management and reduce sedentary behavior. As a consequence, this
novel intervention will improve global health in this population and
support its use in clinical practice. The intervention will be carried
out online with direct weekly contact with the therapist. Consequently,
it has low implementation costs, might improve patient's attendance, and
has the potential to be largely offered elsewhere.},

 abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity and unhealthy dietary habits are known
to be disadvantageous for the development of late adverse effects in
survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer. To make
interventions, aimed at improving lifestyle, fit into the daily life of
survivors, interventions should be designed and delivered in a
person-centred way with a limited time burden. As part of the European
PanCareFollowUp project, an eHealth intervention was developed to
support sustainable changes to physical activity levels and/or diet of
childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors. This
feasibility study aims to gain insight into the feasibility and
potential effect sizes of the PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention.
Methods: The PanCareFollowUp lifestyle intervention consists of
person-centred 3-6 screen-to-screen sessions with a certified lifestyle
coach. The intervention will be evaluated with a single-arm pre-post
feasibility study conducted at two survivorship care clinics in the
Netherlands. A total of 60 participants who are (i) diagnosed with
cancer < 25 years, (ii) \& GE; 5 years post-treatment, (iii) aged 16-55
years, and (iv) have a low physical activity level and/or unhealthy
dietary intake manifested by overweight will be recruited. Using
reports, hospital records, and questionnaires for survivors, coaches,
and late effect doctors, feasibility will be based on (i) adherence to
intervention, (ii) acceptability, (iii) practicality, (iv)
integration/implementation, (v) demand, and (vi) attrition. The
potential effect sizes of the intervention will be explored by
determining the percentage of survivors that reach the personalized
lifestyle goals that were set with the coach. Physical activity level,
dietary intake, BMI, general self-efficacy, self-management, and
motivation level will be assessed at three time points with
questionnaires, reports, and/or an accelerometer. Discussion: Data of
this study will be gathered to assess the feasibility and potential
effect sizes. This will allow for further intervention refinement as
needed as well as to inform a future large-scale intervention study and
a manual for implementation at other centres.},

@article{WOS:000898482000010,
 abstract = {Background: Children referred for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) often present with a broader pattern of conduct problems
including oppositionality and defiance. This combination can be
extremely stressful to parents, lower parents' self-esteem and
negatively impact family life. The National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that families receive support as soon
as possible after their referral. However, as clinical services are
overstretched, and traditional in-person parenting intervention
programmes are expensive, families often must wait times a long time
prior to receiving this vital input. To address this, we have created a
digital parenting programme called STEPS. It is delivered as a mobile
phone app providing a set of tools and resources that can be easily
accessed at parents' convenience. This study aims to evaluate the
clinical and cost-effectiveness of STEPS in supporting parents of
children with high levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention and
conduct problems, who are waiting to be assessed by specialist
children's clinical services. Methods: Online Parent Training for The
Initial Management of ADHD referrals (OPTIMA) is a two-arm superiority
parallel randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot study. We
aim to recruit 352 parents and their children, who have been accepted
onto a waitlist in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services or
similar child health services. Parents who consent will be randomised
1:1 to either the STEPS or wait-as-usual (WAU) group. The trial will be
conducted remotely (online and telephone) with measures taken at
baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-randomisation. The primary
objective is to evaluate whether STEPS reduces the severity of
children's oppositional and defiant behaviour, as rated by parents,
measured at 3 months post-randomisation compared to WAU. Discussion:
Digital solutions, such as mobile phone apps, have potential for
delivering psychological support for parents of children with
clinical-level needs in a timely and inexpensive manner. This trial will
provide data on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the STEPS app,
which could support the implementation of this scalable parenting
intervention programme into standard clinical care and, ultimately,
improve the outcomes for families of children referred to specialist
child and adolescent health services.},

 abstract = {Introduction Previous studies indicate that computerised trainings
implementing cognitive bias modification (CBM) for interpretation bias
might be promising treatments for trauma-related cognitive distortions
and symptoms. However, results are mixed, which might be related to the
implemented task (sentence completion task), setting, or training
duration. Within the present study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of an app-based intervention for interpretation bias using
standardised imagery audio scripts, which is designed as a standalone
treatment.Methods and analysis The study is a randomised controlled
trial, implementing two parallel arms. 130 patients diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be allocated to either the
intervention group or the waiting-list control group receiving treatment
as usual. The intervention consists of 3 weeks of an app-based CBM
training for interpretation bias using mental imagery, with three
training sessions (20 min) per week. Two months after the last training
session, 1 week of booster CBM treatment will be implemented, consisting
of three additional training sessions. Outcome assessments will be
conducted pretraining, 1 week post-training, 2 months post-training, as
well as 1 week after the booster session (approximately 2.5 months after
initial training termination). The primary outcome is interpretation
bias. Secondary outcomes include PTSD-related cognitive distortions and
symptom severity, as well as negative affectivity. Outcome assessment
will be conducted by intention-to-treat analysis, as well as
per-protocol analysis using linear mixed models.Ethics and dissemination
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the State Chamber of
Physicians in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany (number of approval:
F-2022-080). Scientific findings will be published in peer-reviewed
journals informing future clinical studies, which focus on the reduction
of PTSD-related symptoms using CBM.},

 abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aims to: (1) identify the information required by
family caregivers of people with dementia to be targeted within our
dementia family caregiver intervention and (2) test the feasibility of
the intervention and methodology to underpin a fully powered randomized
controlled trial. MethodsThe study setting will be the Department of
Geriatrics at Gia Dinh People's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Inclusion
criteria will be the family caregivers of people with dementia living in
the community, who attend the Department and use smartphones. In phase
1, we will identify the intervention content with family caregivers of
people with dementia through 20 in-depth interviews to determine what
information and skills they need. In phase 2, a pilot randomized control
trial design will be conducted, with 60 family caregivers of people with
dementia being assigned to the intervention or control group by the
block randomization method with a ratio of 1:1. The intervention will
include weekly, online, psycho-educational, group sessions hosted on the
Zalo app. The participants will complete questionnaires at baseline,
immediately postintervention, and 3-month postintervention. The
feasibility of the intervention and methodology will be assessed,
including the rates of recruitment, retention, completion of
assessments, and acceptability of the intervention. ResultsThe required
information and skills in phase 1 may include dealing with worrying
behavior changes in people with dementia, emotional support, and seeking
support sources. The rates of recruitment, retention, completion of
assessments, and acceptability of the intervention will be obtained in
phase 2. The scores of symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety in
the intervention group may be lower than those in the control group at
postintervention and 3-month postintervention. ConclusionThe study will
provide a foundation for a fully powered clinical trial for the
smartphone app-based intervention to reduce stress, depression, and
anxiety among family caregivers of people with dementia in Vietnam.},

 abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer new opportunities to
deliver psychological treatments for mental illness in an accessible,
private format. The results of several previous systematic reviews
support the use of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and
depression symptom management. However, it remains unclear how much or
how long the minimum treatment ``dose{''} is for an mHealth intervention
to be effective. Just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) has been
introduced in the mHealth domain to facilitate behavior changes and is
positioned to guide the design of mHealth interventions with enhanced
adherence and effectiveness.Objective: Inspired by the JITAI framework,
we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the dose
effectiveness of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and
depression symptom reduction.Methods: We conducted a literature search
on 7 databases (ie, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, Scopus, Cochrane
Library (eg, CENTRAL), ScienceDirect, and ClinicalTrials, for
publications from January 2012 to April 2020. We included randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating app-based mHealth interventions for
anxiety and depression. The study selection and data extraction process
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We estimated the pooled effect size
using Hedge g and appraised study quality using the revised Cochrane
risk-of-bias tool for RCTs.Results: We included 15 studies involving
2627 participants for 18 app-based mHealth interventions. Participants
in the intervention groups showed a significant effect on anxiety (Hedge
g=-.10, 95\% CI -0.14 to -0.06, I2=0\%) but not on depression (Hedge
g=-.08, 95\% CI -0.23 to 0.07, I2=4\%). Interventions of at least 7
weeks' duration had larger effect sizes on anxiety symptom
reduction.Conclusions: There is inconclusive evidence for clinical use
of app-based mHealth interventions for anxiety and depression at the
current stage due to the small to nonsignificant effects of the
interventions and study quality concerns. The recommended dose of
mHealth interventions and the sustainability of intervention
effectiveness remain unclear and require further investigation.},

@article{WOS:000973635700046,
 abstract = {Background: Internet-based interventions (IBIs) are as efficient as
face-to-face psychotherapy for a variety of mental health disorders,
including complicated grief. Most evidence stems from guided IBIs.
However, recent research indicates that the benefit of guidance is lower
in more interactive IBIs. As such, providing guidance only to people
requiring it (guidance on demand) appears a cost-effective solution.
This is particularly important to develop given the recent rise in grief
symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents
the protocol of a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy and
adherence rate of 2 IBIs for grief-related symptoms after the loss a
close one following death or romantic separation, using a guidance on
demand framework. LIVIA 2.0 was developed based on theoretical and
empirical findings on grief processes and IBIs, and it will be compared
to LIVIA 1 that has already demonstrated its efficacy.
Objective: Our main hypotheses are that LIVIA 1 (control condition) and
LIVIA 2.0 (experimental condition) increase participants' well-being and
decrease their distress at posttest and at follow-up, that LIVIA 2.0 is
more efficient than LIVIA 1 for all outcomes, and that LIVIA 2.0 has
less dropouts than LIVIA 1.
Methods: Outcomes will be assessed at pretest, posttest (12 weeks
later), and follow-up (24 weeks later). We will recruit 234 participants
through a variety of means, including social media and contacts with the
press. Primary outcomes are grief symptoms, depressive symptoms, and
eudemonic well-being. Secondary outcomes are anxiety symptoms, grief
coping strategies, aspects related to self-identity reorganization, and
program satisfaction. LIVIA 2.0 participants will additionally undergo a
weekly mood and grief symptom monitoring, allowing us to explore the
short-term efficacy of the sessions.
Results: The creation and development of the content of LIVIA 2.0 was
completed during the first phase of the project. Participant recruitment
will begin in May 2022 and will last until January 2023.
Conclusions: This study will emphasize the relevance of the innovations
included in LIVIA 2.0 regarding the efficacy and dropout rate of IBIs
for grief symptoms and will allow investigations on how these changes
impact the demand for guidance. In the current postpandemic times,
developing and assessing IBIs targeting grief symptoms are particularly
critical given the rise in grief-related symptoms.},

 abstract = {BackgroundThe growing number of patients with type 2 diabetes and
prediabetes is a major public health concern. Physical activity is a
cornerstone of diabetes management and may prevent its onset in
prediabetes patients. Despite this, many patients with (pre)diabetes
remain physically inactive. Primary care physicians are well-situated to
deliver interventions to increase their patients' physical activity
levels. However, effective and sustainable physical activity
interventions for (pre)diabetes patients that can be translated into
routine primary care are lacking.MethodsWe describe the rationale and
protocol for a 12-month pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, controlled
trial assessing the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention delivered
in general practice to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary
behaviour of patients with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (ENERGISED).
Twenty-one general practices will recruit 340 patients with
(pre)diabetes during routine health check-ups. Patients allocated to the
active control arm will receive a Fitbit activity tracker to
self-monitor their daily steps and try to achieve the recommended step
goal. Patients allocated to the intervention arm will additionally
receive the mHealth intervention, including the delivery of several text
messages per week, with some of them delivered just in time, based on
data continuously collected by the Fitbit tracker. The trial consists of
two phases, each lasting six months: the lead-in phase, when the mHealth
intervention will be supported with human phone counselling, and the
maintenance phase, when the intervention will be fully automated. The
primary outcome, average ambulatory activity (steps/day) measured by a
wrist-worn accelerometer, will be assessed at the end of the maintenance
phase at 12 months.DiscussionThe trial has several strengths, such as
the choice of active control to isolate the net effect of the
intervention beyond simple self-monitoring with an activity tracker,
broad eligibility criteria allowing for the inclusion of patients
without a smartphone, procedures to minimise selection bias, and
involvement of a relatively large number of general practices. These
design choices contribute to the trial's pragmatic character and ensure
that the intervention, if effective, can be translated into routine
primary care practice, allowing important public health benefits.},

 abstract = {Background Digital health interventions are effective for hypertension
self-management, but a comparison of the effectiveness and
implementation of the different modes of interventions is not currently
available. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS,
smartphone application, and website interventions on improving blood
pressure in adults with hypertension, and to report on their reach,
uptake, and feasibility. Methods In this systematic review and
meta-analysis we searched CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo on May
25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English
from Jan 1, 2009, that examined the effectiveness of digital health
interventions on reducing blood pressure in adults with hypertension.
Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted
following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint was change in the
mean of systolic blood pressure. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane
Risk of Bias 2. Data on systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction
were synthesised in a meta-analysis, and data on reach, uptake and
feasibility were summarised narratively. Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were used to evaluate
the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO
CRD42021247845.Findings Of the 3235 records identified, 29 RCTs from 13
regions (n=7592 participants) were included in the systematic review,
and 28 of these RCTs (n=7092 participants) were included in the
meta-analysis. 11 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of
the digital health intervention, 13 used smartphone applications, and
five used websites. Overall, digital health intervention group
participants had a -3.62 mm Hg (95\% CI -5.22 to -2.02) greater
reduction in systolic blood pressure, and a -2.45 mm Hg (-3.83 to -1.07)
greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure, compared with control
group participants. No statistically significant differences between the
three different modes of delivery were observed for both the systolic
(p=0.73) and the diastolic blood pressure (p=0.80) outcomes. Smartphone
application interventions had a statistically significant reduction in
diastolic blood pressure (-2.45 mm Hg {[}-4.15 to -0.74]); however,
there were no statistically significant reductions for SMS interventions
(-1.80 mm Hg {[}-4.60 to 1.00]) or website interventions (-3.43 mm Hg
{[}-7.24 to 0.38]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between
included studies and the high risk of bias in some, the level of
evidence was assigned a low overall score. Interventions were more
effective among people with greater severity of hypertension at
baseline. SMS interventions reported higher reach and smartphone
application studies reported higher uptake, but differences were not
statistically significant.Interpretation SMS, smartphone application,
and website interventions were associated with statistically and
clinically significant systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions,
compared with usual care, regardless of the mode of delivery of the
intervention. This conclusion is tempered by the considerable
heterogeneity of included studies and the high risk of bias in most.
Future studies need to describe in detail the mediators and moderators
of the effectiveness and implementation of these interventions, to both
further improve their effectiveness as well as increase their reach,
uptake, and feasibility.},

 abstract = {Purposeof ReviewThe prevalence of problematic substance use is
disproportionately higher among sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults
compared to adults in the general population. mHealth as a treatment
modality could reduce barriers to accessing substance use treatments
among SGM populations. Through a qualitative literature search, the
current narrative review aimed to understand the lived experiences of
SGM individuals who use substances and to synthesize recommendations
made in the literature to inform future mHealth interventions.Recent
FindingsPositive and negative reinforcement motives were prominent
reasons for substance use, which included SGM identity expression and
conformity motives. Individual- and system-level treatment barriers
included a lack of safe and nonjudgmental environment, shame and stigma,
and limited knowledge about treatment options. Barriers were directly
linked to the reported substance use treatment needs in this
population.On-demand app features, real-time intervention and
assessment, and anonymity should be considered in future mHealth trials.},

 abstract = {Background: Chronic pain (CP) is 1 of the leading causes of disability
worldwide and represents a significant burden on individual, social, and
economic aspects. Potential tools, such as mobile health (mHealth)
systems, are emerging for the self-management of patients with
CP.Objective: A systematic review was conducted to analyze the effects
of mHealth interventions on CP management, based on pain intensity,
quality of life (QoL), and functional disability assessment, compared to
conventional treatment or nonintervention.Methods: PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines
were followed to conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and
Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases from February to March
2022. No filters were used. The eligibility criteria were RCTs of adults
(>= 18 years old) with CP, intervened with mHealth systems based on
mobile apps for monitoring pain and health-related outcomes, for pain
and behavioral self-management, and for performing therapeutic
approaches, compared to conventional treatments (physical, occupational,
and psychological therapies; usual medical care; and education) or
nonintervention, reporting pain intensity, QoL, and functional
disability. The methodological quality and risk of bias (RoB) were
assessed using the Checklist for Measuring Quality, the Oxford Centre
for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence, and the Cochrane RoB 2.0
tool.Results: In total, 22 RCTs, involving 2641 patients with different
CP conditions listed in the International Classification of Diseases
11th Revision (ICD-11), including chronic low back pain (CLBP), chronic
musculoskeletal pain (CMSP), chronic neck pain (CNP), unspecified CP,
chronic pelvic pain (CPP), fibromyalgia (FM), interstitial
cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
and osteoarthritis (OA). A total of 23 mHealth systems were used to
conduct a variety of CP self-management strategies, among which
monitoring pain and symptoms and home-based exercise programs were the
most used. Beneficial effects of the use of mHealth systems in reducing
pain intensity (CNP, FM, IC/BPS, and OA), QoL (CLBP, CNP, IBS, and OA),
and functional disability (CLBP, CMSP, CNP, and OA) were found. Most of
the included studies (18/22, 82\%) reported medium methodological
quality and were considered as highly recommendable; in addition, 7/22
(32\%) studies had a low RoB, 10/22 (45\%) had some concerns, and 5/22
(23\%) had a high RoB. Conclusions: The use of mHealth systems indicated
positive effects for pain intensity in CNP, FM, IC/BPS, and OA; for QoL
in CLBP, CNP, IBS, and OA; and for functional disability in CLBP, CMSP,
CNP, and OA. Thus, mHealth seems to be an alternative to improving
pain-related outcomes and QoL and could be part of multimodal strategies
for CP self-management. High-quality studies are needed to merge the
evidence and recommendations of the use of mHealth systems for CP
management.Trial Registration: PROSPERO International Prospective

 abstract = {Background: Using a theoretical perspective to guide research design and
implementation can result in a coherent preventative intervention model.
Among theoretical frameworks, Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is
particularly useful for studies focused on behavior change in health
promotion research.Objective: This scoping review explored and
summarized the current evidence on health promotion interventions that
integrated constructs of Social Cognitive Theory and the outcome of
those interventions in primary care settings.Method: ology: We conducted
this scoping review using the PRISMA scoping review guidelines; we
reviewed articles from five electronic databases and additional sources
that were peerreviewed journal articles reporting interventions applying
SCT constructs and synthesized the outcomes following the
interventions.Results: Among 849 retrieved from multiple sources, 39
articles met our eligibility criteria. Most studies (n = 19) were
conducted in the United States. Twenty-six studies followed a randomized
control trial design. Most studies (n = 26) recruited participants
utilizing the primary care network. All 39 studies mentioned
``self-efficacy{''} as the most utilized construct of SCT to determine
how behavior change operates, followed by ``observational learning{''}
through role models. Twenty-three studies integrated individual
(face-to-face) or peered group-based counselingtraining programs; eight
interventions used telephonic health coaching by a specialist; eight
studies used audio-visual mediums. All included studies reported
positive health outcomes following the intervention, including increased
self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, increased
Knowledge of dietary intake, high-risk behaviors such as STIs
transmission, adapting to a healthy lifestyle, and adherence to
post-transplant medication.Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that
SCT-based interventions positively impact health outcomes and
intervention effectiveness. The results of this study indicate the
importance of incorporating and assessing several conceptual structures
of behavioral theories when planning any primary care health promotion
practice.},

 abstract = {Symptom measurement in psychiatric research increasingly uses digitized
self-report inventories and is turning to crowdsourcing platforms for
recruitment, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). The impact of
digitizing pencil-and-paper inventories on the psychometric properties
is underexplored in mental health research. Against this background,
numerous studies report high prevalence estimates of psychiatric
symptoms in mTurk samples. Here we develop a framework to evaluate the
online implementation of psychiatric symptom inventories relative to two
domains, that is, the adherence to (i) validated scoring and (ii)
standardized administration. We apply this new framework to the online
use of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test
(AUDIT). Our systematic review of the literature identified 36
implementations of these three inventories on mTurk across 27
publications. We also evaluated methodo-logical approaches to enhance
data quality, e.g., the use of bot detection and attention check items.
Of the 36 implementations, 23 reported the applied diagnostic scoring
criteria and only 18 reported the specified symptom timeframe. None of
the 36 implementations reported adaptations made in their digitization
of the inventories. While recent reports attribute higher rates of mood,
anxiety, and alcohol use disorders on mTurk to data quality, our
findings indicate that this inflation may also relate to the assessment
methods. We provide recommendations to enhance both data quality and
fidelity to validated administration and scoring methods.},

 abstract = {The predictD is an intervention implemented by general practitioners
(GPs) to prevent depression, which reduced the incidence of
depression-anxiety and was cost-effective. The e-predictD study aims to
design, develop, and evaluate an evolved predictD intervention to
prevent the onset of major depression in primary care based on
Information and Communication Technologies, predictive risk algorithms,
decision support systems (DSSs), and personalized prevention plans
(PPPs). A multicenter cluster randomized trial with GPs randomly
assigned to the e-predictD intervention + care-as-usual (CAU) group or
the active-control + CAU group and 1-year follow-up is being conducted.
The required sample size is 720 non-depressed patients (aged 18-55
years), with moderate-to-high depression risk, under the care of 72 GPs
in six Spanish cities. The GPs assigned to the e-predictD-intervention
group receive brief training, and those assigned to the control group do
not. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the e-predictD group
download the e-predictD app, which incorporates validated risk
algorithms to predict depression, monitoring systems, and DSSs.
Integrating all inputs, the DSS automatically proposes to the patients a
PPP for depression based on eight intervention modules: physical
exercise, social relationships, improving sleep, problem-solving,
communication skills, decision-making, assertiveness, and working with
thoughts. This PPP is discussed in a 15-min semi-structured GP-patient
interview. Patients then choose one or more of the intervention modules
proposed by the DSS to be self-implemented over the next 3 months. This
process will be reformulated at 3, 6, and 9 months but without the
GP-patient interview. Recruited patients of the GPs allocated to the
control-group+CAU download another version of the e-predictD app, but
the only intervention that they receive via the app is weekly brief
psychoeducational messages (active-control group). The primary outcome
is the cumulative incidence of major depression measured by the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview at 6 and 12 months. Other
outcomes include depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and anxiety symptoms
(GAD-7), depression risk (predictD risk algorithm), mental and physical
quality of life (SF-12), and acceptability and satisfaction ('e-Health
Impact' questionnaire) with the intervention. Patients are evaluated at
baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. An economic evaluation will also be
performed (cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis) from two
perspectives, societal and health systems.},

 abstract = {Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to determine the
effectiveness of self-guided digital physical activity (PA) and exercise
interventions to improve physical activity and exercise (PA \& E)
outcomes for people living with chronic health conditions. Digital
health interventions, especially those with minimal human contact, may
offer a sustainable solution to accessing ongoing services and support
for this population.Methods: A comprehensive and systematic search was
conducted up to December 2021, through seven databases, for randomized
trials that evaluated the effect of self-guided web- or internet-based
PA interventions on physical activity or exercise outcomes. Included
studies had to have interventions with minimal human contact and
interaction with participants needed to be automatically generated. All
studies were screened for eligibility and relevant data were extracted.
Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane
risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences and 95\% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated. PA data were pooled, and forest plots
were generated.Results: Sixteen studies met the eligibility criteria and
included a total of 2,439 participants. There was wide variation in
health conditions and intervention characteristics in mode and
parameters of delivery, and in the application of theory and behavioral
strategies. Self-reported PA in the intervention group was greater than
controls at the end of the intervention {[}standardized mean difference
(SMD) 0.2, 95\% CI = 0.1, 0.3] and at follow up (SMD 0.3, 95\% CI
0.2-0.5). The difference in objectively measured PA was small and
non-significant (SMD 0.3, 95\% CI -0.2 to 0.9). All interventions
included behavioral strategies and ten of the sixteen were underpinned
by theory.Conclusions: Self-guided digital PA \& E interventions
provided a positive effect on PA immediately after the intervention. An
unexpected and positive finding was a sustained increase in PA at
follow-up, particularly for interventions where the behavioral
strategies were underpinned by a theoretical framework. Interventions
with minimal contact have the potential to support sustained PA
engagement at least as well as interventions with supervision.Systematic

 abstract = {Background: Chronic (ie, long-term) elevated stress is associated with a
number of mental and physical health conditions. Mindfulness meditation
mobile apps are a promising tool for stress self-management that can
overcome several barriers associated with in-person interventions;
however, to date, poor app-based intervention adherence has limited the
efficacy of these mobile health tools. Anchoring, or pairing, a new
behavior with an existing routine has been shown to effectively
establish habits that are maintained over time, but this strategy
typically only works for those with high initial motivation and has yet
to be tested for maintaining meditation with a mobile app.Objective:
This study will test novel combinations of behavioral economics-based
incentives with the anchoring strategy for establishing and maintaining
adherence to an effective dose of meditation with a mobile app.Methods:
This 16-week study will use a 5-arm, parallel, partially blinded
(participants only), randomized controlled design. We will implement a
fractional factorial study design that varies the use of self-monitoring
messages and financial incentives to support participants' use of their
personalized anchoring strategy for maintaining adherence to a \& GE;10
minute-per-day meditation prescription during an 8-week intervention
period, followed by an 8-week postintervention observation period.
Specifically, we will vary the use of self-monitoring messages of either
the target behavior (ie, meditation tracking) or the outcome associated
with the target behavior (ie, mood symptom tracking). We will also vary
the use of financial incentives conditional on either meditation at any
time of day or meditation performed at approximately the same time of
day as participants' personalized anchors.Results: Continuous meditation
app use data will be used to measure weekly meditation adherence over
the 16-week study period as a binary variable equal to 1 if participants
complete \& GE;10 minutes of meditation for \& GE;4 days per week and 0
otherwise. We will measure weekly anchoring plan adherence as a binary
variable equal to 1 if participants complete \& GE;10 minutes of
meditation within +1 or -1 hour of the timing of their chosen anchor on
\& GE;4 days per week and 0 otherwise. In addition to these primary
measures of meditation and anchoring plan adherence, we will also assess
the secondary measures of stress, anxiety, posttraumatic stress
disorder, sleep disturbance, and meditation app habit strength at
baseline, week 8, and week 16.Conclusions: This study will fill an
important gap in the mobile health literature by testing novel
intervention approaches for establishing and maintaining adherence to

 abstract = {Background: Digital health technologies using mobile apps and wearable
devices are a promising approach to the investigation of substance use
in the real world and for the analysis of predictive factors or harms
from substance use. Moreover, consecutive repeated data collection
enables the development of predictive algorithms for substance use by
machine learning methods. Objective: We developed a new self-monitoring
mobile app to record daily substance use, triggers, and cravings.
Additionally, a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit) was used to collect
objective biological and behavioral data before, during, and after
substance use. This study aims to describe a model using machine
learning methods to determine substance use. Methods: This study is an
ongoing observational study using a Fitbit and a self-monitoring app.
Participants of this study were people with health risks due to alcohol
or methamphetamine use. They were required to record their daily
substance use and related factors on the self-monitoring app and to
always wear a Fitbit for 8 weeks, which collected the following data:
(1) heart rate per minute, (2) sleep duration per day, (3) sleep stages
per day, (4) the number of steps per day, and (5) the amount of physical
activity per day. Fitbit data will first be visualized for data analysis
to confirm typical Fitbit data patterns for individual users. Next,
machine learning and statistical analysis methods will be performed to
create a detection model for substance use based on the combined Fitbit
and self-monitoring data. The model will be tested based on 5-fold
cross-validation, and further preprocessing and machine learning methods
will be conducted based on the preliminary results. The usability and
feasibility of this approach will also be evaluated. Results: Enrollment
for the trial began in September 2020, and the data collection finished
in April 2021. In total, 13 people with methamphetamine use disorder and
36 with alcohol problems participated in this study. The severity of
methamphetamine or alcohol use disorder assessed by the Drug Abuse
Screening Test-10 or the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-10
was moderate to severe. The anticipated results of this study include
understanding the physiological and behavioral data before, during, and
after alcohol or methamphetamine use and identifying individual patterns
of behavior. Conclusions: Real-time data on daily life among people with
substance use problems were collected in this study. This new approach
to data collection might be helpful because of its high confidentiality
and convenience. The findings of this study will provide data to support
the development of interventions to reduce alcohol and methamphetamine
use and associated negative consequences.},

 abstract = {Despite the low utilization rates of substance use and related disorders
services, and the ability of internet-based interventions for substance
use and related disorders (IBIS) to address challenges related to
service engagement, limited attention has been placed on the processes
for the accommodation of these interventions to diverse cultural
settings. This study aimed to develop a framework for the cultural
accommodation of IBIS across populations based on a pilot study and a
literature review. A pilot study of cultural accommodation of an
existing internet intervention for alcohol use was carried out in
Israel, which involved focus groups and daily online surveys of
prospective consumers (N = 24) as well as interviews with experts (N =
7) in the substance abuse treatment field. Thematic analysis revealed a
range of themes that relate to the general Israeli culture and the
specific Israeli drinking subculture, identified as needing to be
addressed in the process of intervention accommodation. A comprehensive
framework for cultural accommodation of IBIS is suggested, consisting of
five stages: Technical and cultural feasibility; Engagement of target
group; Identification of accommodation variables, Accommodation, and
evaluation of the accommodated intervention. In addition, the framework
consists of four dimensions of accommodation: Barriers and facilitators;
Audio-visual materials and language; Mechanisms of change;
Intersectional factors. We suggest that the proposed framework may serve
as a guide for the cultural accommodation of existing internet-based
interventions for substance use and related disorders across a range of
cultural and geographical settings, thus augmenting the ecological
validity of internet-based interventions for substance use and related
disorders, expanding cross-cultural intervention research, and reducing
health disparities worldwide.},

 abstract = {Background: Maternal smoking and stress during pregnancy are associated
with adverse health effects for women themselves and are risk factors
for adverse developmental outcomes of the unborn child. Smoking and
stress seem to be intertwined in various ways. First, the majority of
smoking pregnant women is of lower socio-economic status, which is
associated with higher levels of perceived stress. Second, smoking women
often report to smoke because they feel stressed. Third, quitting
smoking often increases perceived stress levels initially. Therefore,
effective interventions are needed to support women with smoking
cessation by reducing stress. The aim of this study is to test the
effectiveness of an eHealth intervention on stress reduction and smoking
cessation.
Methods/design: The Stress- and Smoke Free Start of Life (SSFSL) study
is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a personalized eHealth
intervention with a control condition. Inclusion criteria for the women
are: (1) > 18 years of age, (2) < 28 weeks pregnant at recruitment, (3)
currently smoking. Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to
the intervention or control group. Participants allocated to the
intervention group will receive an 8-week intervention delivered on
their smartphone. The application includes psycho-education on
pregnancy, stress, and smoking (cessation); stress-management training
consisting of Heart Rate Variability-biofeedback; and a personalized
stop-smoking-plan. Participants in the control condition will be invited
to visit a webpage with information on pregnancy, stress, and smoking
(cessation). Study outcomes will be collected via online questionnaires,
at four timepoints: pre-intervention (baseline; t0), post-intervention
(8 weeks + 1 day after t0; t1), follow up at two weeks after birth (t2),
and follow up at three months after birth (t3). The primary outcome
measure is self-reported smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes include
daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked, perceived stress,
pregnancy experience, birth outcomes, and negative affectivity scores of
the baby. Moreover, the mediating effect of stress reduction on smoking
cessation will be examined, and possible moderators will be tested.
Discussion: If the eHealth intervention is effective in smoking
cessation among pregnant smoking women, it can be implemented as a tool
into the health care in the Netherlands.},

 abstract = {Background: Side effects of breast cancer treatment may persist long
into survivorship, reducing quality of life (QOL) in patients with
breast cancer and survivors. There is growing evidence for the use of
digital health technologies, such as mobile apps, to support
self-management, decrease symptom burden, and improve QOL in patients
with cancer. However, an updated overview of the effects of mobile apps
on QOL and well-being in patients with breast cancer and survivors is
needed. Objective: The aim of this review was to provide an overview of
breast cancer-specific, mobile app-driven lifestyle or behavioral
interventions in patient care through to survivorship and their impact
on QOL and mental well-being. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed,
Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant studies.
The inclusion criteria were limited to original studies involving a
trial of a mobile app-driven lifestyle or behavioral intervention for
patients with breast cancer or survivors and using QOL or well-being
measures. The results of the studies that met the inclusion criterion
were then synthesized in text and table format. The quality of the
evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Results: A
total of 17 studies with the number of participants ranging from 23 to
356 met the inclusion criterion. Of the 17 reviewed studies, 7 (41\%)
delivered an app-only intervention, and 10 (59\%) combined an app with
additional supporting materials, such as SMS text messaging,
telecoaching, wearables, or printed materials. Among the 17 reviewed
studies, 6 (35\%) focused on aiding patients with breast cancer during
the active treatment phase (excluding ongoing hormone therapy), whereas
the remaining 11 (65\%) focused on survivorship. The majority of the
studies (14/17, 82\%) observed some positive effects on QOL or
well-being measures. Conclusions: The results of the review indicate
that mobile apps are a promising avenue for improving QOL and well-being
in breast cancer care. Positive effects were observed in patients
undergoing active treatment in all reviewed studies, but effects were
less clear after chemotherapy and in long-term survivors. Although
lifestyle and behavioral digital interventions are still being
developed, and further research should still be pursued, the available
data suggest that current mobile health apps aid patients with breast
cancer and survivors.},

 abstract = {BackgroundStress is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic heart
disease (IHD) and is associated with lower health-related quality of
life and impaired cardiovascular outcome. The importance of stress
management is now recognized in recent guidelines for the management of
cardiovascular disease. However, effective stress management
interventions are not implemented in clinical routine yet. The
development of easily disseminated eHealth interventions, particularly
mHealth, may offer a cost-effective and scalable solution to this
problem. The aim of the proposed trial is to assess the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of the mHealth intervention ``mindfulHeart{''} in
terms of reducing stress in patients with IHD.Methods and analysisThis
randomized controlled confirmatory interventional trial with two
parallel arms has assessments at six measurement time points: baseline
(T0, prior randomization), post-treatment (T1), and four follow-ups at
months 1, 3, 6, and 12 after intervention (T2, T3, T4, and T5). We will
include patients with confirmed diagnosis of IHD, high-perceived stress,
and use of an internet-enabled smartphone. Patients will be randomized
into two groups (intervention vs. control). The proposed sample size
calculation allocates 128 participants in total. The primary analysis

 abstract = {BackgroundExisting studies have unequivocally demonstrated that parents
of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience various
stressful daily life events and suffer from psychological distress.
Mindfulness level is found to be an effective buffer between parents'
appraisal of stress life events and psychological distress. However, the
mechanism behind the function of mindfulness is unclear, and traditional
mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) in experimental settings is not
tailored to personal real-life needs. This study proposes to conduct a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of MBI
delivered by ecological momentary intervention (EMI) and assessed by
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in changing participants'
cognitive appraisal of stressful life events and thus reducing the
psychological distress of parents of children with ASD.MethodThe
proposed study will recruit 670 parents of children with ASD and
randomly assign them to the intervention and control groups (335 in each
group). Participants in the intervention group will install the EMI/A
app on their smartphones. In the app, participants can receive practice
prompts daily, browse and practice different mindfulness exercises in
the intervention library at any time, talk to a virtual counselor
(chatbot) when feeling stressed, complete EMA on the cognitive appraisal
of life events, and receive the log of change of psychological status
daily. Participants in the control group will only receive audio-based
standardized mindfulness practice instructions three times per week. The
effects of MBI will be assessed based on the EMA data, right after the
intervention and at the 2-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be
participants' psychological distress measured by the depression anxiety
stress scale. The secondary outcomes will include participants'
subjective well-being, measured by the satisfaction with life scale, and
level of resilience, measured by the psychological empowerment scale.
Multilevel structural equational modelling will be applied to examine
the pathways of the relationship between daily life events, cognitive
appraisal, and psychological distress.DiscussionThe potential benefit of
the proposed study is to increase the psychological well-being of
parents of children with ASD, and the method may extend to participants
suffering from other psychological issues in the future.Trial

face-to-face interventions in psychosis were identified in a systematic
search conducted in PubMed/Ovid MEDLINE. Data were extracted
independently by two researchers, and standardized mean changes were
pooled using a three-level model and network

complementing treatment as usual (TAU) were generally superior to
face-to-face interventions (g = 0.16, p \& LE; 0.0001) and to specific
outcomes, namely, neurocognition (g = 0.13, p \& LE; 0.0001),
functioning (g = 0.25, p = 0.006), and social cognition (g = 0.32, p \&
LE; 0.05). Based on the network meta-analysis, the effect of two TBIs
differed significantly from zero; these were the TBIs cognitive training
for the neurocognitive outcome {[}g = 0.16; 95\% confidence interval
(CI) 0.09-0.23] and cognitive behavioral therapy for quality of life (g
= 1.27; 95\% CI 0.46-2.08). The variables educational level, type of
medication, frequency of the intervention, and contact during the
intervention moderated the effectiveness of TBIs over face-to-face
interventions in neurocognition and symptomatology.ConclusionsTBIs are
effective for the management of neurocognition, symptomatology,
functioning, social cognition, and quality of life outcomes in patients
with psychosis. The results of the network meta-analysis showed the
efficacy of some TBIs for neurocognition, symptomatology, and quality of
life. Therefore, TBIs should be considered a complement to TAU in
patients with psychosis.},

 abstract = {IntroductionOlder adults with hip fracture often require extensive
post-surgery care across multiple sectors, making follow-up care even
more important to ensure an ideal recovery. With the increased adoption
of technology, patient-clinician digital health interventions can
potentially improve post-surgery outcomes of hip fracture patients by
helping them and their caregivers better understand the various aspects
of their care, post-hip fracture surgery. The purpose of this study was
to examine the available literature on the impact of hip
fracture-specific, patient-clinician digital health interventions on
patient outcomes and health care delivery processes. We also aimed to
identify the barriers and enablers to the uptake and implementation of
these technologies and to provide strategies for improved use of these
digital health interventions.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review
following the six stages of Arksey and O'Malley's framework and
following the PRISMA-ScR reporting format. Searches were conducted in
five databases. In addition to hand searching for relevant studies from
the references of all included studies, we also conducted a grey
literature search to identify relevant primary studies. Screening of
titles and abstracts as well as full texts were performed independently
by two reviewers. Two reviewers also performed the data extraction of
the included studies.ResultsAfter screening 3,638 records, 20 articles
met the criteria and 1 article was identified through hand searching.
Various patient-clinician digital health interventions were described
including telehealth /telerehabilitation programs (n = 6), care
transition /follow-up interventions (n = 5), online resources (n = 2),
and wearable devices /sensor monitoring (n = 1). Outcomes were varied
and included functional status, gait/mobility, quality of life,
psychological factors, satisfaction, survival/complications, caregiver
outcomes, compliance, technology-user interactions, and feedback on the
use of the digital health interventions. For clinicians, a key barrier
to the use of the digital health interventions was the acceptability of
the technology. However, the usefulness of the digital health
intervention by clinicians was seen as both a barrier and an enabler.
For patients and caregivers, all the themes were seen as both a barrier
and an enabler depending on the study. These themes included: 1)
availability and access, 2) usability, 3) knowledge and skills, 4)
acceptability, and 5) usefulness of the digital health
intervention.ConclusionMany behavioural factors affect the use of
patient-clinician digital health interventions. However, a specific
attention should be focused on the acceptability of the technology by
the clinicians to encourage uptake of the digital health interventions.
The results of this scoping review can help to better understand the
factors that may be targeted to increase the use of these technologies
by clinicians, patients, and caregivers.},

 abstract = {Introduction: Using software for self-management interventions can
improve health outcomes for individuals with low back pain, but there is
a dearth of research to confirm its effectiveness. Additionally, no
known research has evaluated the effective elements of software-based
interventions for low back pain self-management components. This study
aimed to synthesize the effectiveness of software-based interventions to
promote self-management health outcomes among individuals with low back
pain.Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis was
conducted.Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement, relevant studies up to
July 2022 were searched via four electronic databases: PubMed, Embase,
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of
Science.Results: 4908 adults with low back pain who participated in 23
studies were included. Software-based interventions were effective in
reducing fear avoidance (mean difference {[}MD] = -0.95, 95\% CI: -1.45
to -0.44), pain catastrophizing (MD = -1.31, 95\% CI: -1.84 to -0.78),
disability (MD = -8.21, 95\% CI: -13.02 to -3.39), and pain intensity
(MD = -0.86, 95\% CI: -1.17 to -0.55). Specifically, interventions that
included an exercise component were more effective in reducing pain and
disability. Additionally, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
intervention significantly reduced fear avoidance and pain
catastrophizing but had no noticeable impact on disability and pain
compared to standard treatment. The certainty of the evidence in this
review varied from very low to high across outcomes. The heterogeneity
of the study results was significant, suggesting that future studies in
this area could optimize the design, time points, measures, and outcomes
to strengthen the evidence.Conclusions: Low back pain self-management
interventions delivered through software-based programs effectively
reduce pain intensity, disability, fear avoidance, and pain
catastrophizing.Clinical Relevance: Low back pain is among the most
common reasons for seeking healthcare visits. Combining exercise and
counseling through soft-based programs may effectively address this
issue and its associated suffering and disability.},

 abstract = {Purpose of ReviewAs care for older adult patients with schizophrenia
lacks innovation, technology can help advance the field. Specifically,
digital phenotyping, the real-time monitoring of patients' behaviors
through smartphone sensors and symptoms through surveys, holds promise
as the method can capture the dynamicity and environmental correlates of
disease.Recent FindingsFew studies have used digital phenotyping to
elucidate adult patients' experiences with schizophrenia. In this
narrative review, we summarized the literature using digital phenotyping
on adults with schizophrenia. No study focused solely on older adult
patients. Studies including all adult patients were heterogeneous in
measures used, duration, and outcomes.SummaryDespite limited research,
digital phenotyping shows potential for monitoring outcomes such as
negative, positive, and functional symptoms, as well as predicting
relapse. Future research should work to target the symptomology
persistent in chronic schizophrenia and ensure all patients have the
digital literacy required to benefit from digital interventions and

 abstract = {Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) affects between 13\% and
47\% of the population, with a global growth rate of 20.3\% within the
last 15 years, suggesting that there is a high need for effective
treatments. Pain diaries have long been a common tool in
nonpharmacological pain treatment for monitoring and providing feedback
on patients' symptoms in daily life. More recently, positive refocusing
techniques have come to be used, promoting pain-free episodes and
positive outcomes rather than focusing on managing the pain.Objective:
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility (ie, acceptability,
intervention adherence, and fidelity) and initial signals of efficacy of
the PerPAIN app, an ecological momentary intervention for patients with
CMSP. The app comprises digitalized monitoring using the experience
sampling method (ESM) and feedback. In addition, the patients receive 3
microinterventions targeted at refocusing of attention on positive
events.Methods: In a microrandomized trial, we will recruit 35 patients
with CMSP who will be offered the app for 12 weeks. Participants will be
prompted to fill out 4 ESM monitoring questionnaires a day assessing
information on their current context and the proximal outcome variables:
absence of pain, positive mood, and subjective activity. Participants
will be randomized daily and weekly to receive no feedback, verbal
feedback, or visual feedback on proximal outcomes assessed by the ESM.
In addition, the app will encourage participants to complete 3
microinterventions based on positive psychology and cognitive behavioral
therapy techniques. These microinterventions are prompts to report
joyful moments and everyday successes or to plan pleasant activities.
After familiarizing themselves with each microintervention individually,
participants will be randomized daily to receive 1 of the 3 exercises or
none. We will assess whether the 2 feedback types and the 3
microinterventions increase proximal outcomes at the following time
point. The microrandomized trial is part of the PerPAIN randomized
controlled trial (German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00022792)
investigating a personalized treatment approach to enhance treatment
outcomes in CMSP. Results: Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee
II of the University of Heidelberg on August 4, 2020. Recruitment for
the microrandomized trial began in May 2021 and is ongoing at the time
of submission. By October 10, 2022, a total of 24 Conclusions: This
trial will provide evidence on the feasibility of the PerPAIN app and
the initial signals of efficacy of the different intervention
components. In the next step, the intervention would need to be further
refined and investigated in a definitive trial. This ecological
momentary intervention presents a potential method for offering
low-level accessible treatment to a wide range of people, which could
have substantial implications for public health by reducing disease
burden of chronic pain in theInternational Registered Report Identifier

@article{WOS:001101462700002,
 abstract = {Background: In 2020, Greater New Orleans, Louisiana, was home to 7048
people living with HIV-1083 per 100,000 residents, 2.85 times the US
national rate. With Louisiana routinely ranked last in indexes of health
equity, violent crime rates in Orleans Parish quintupling national
averages, and in-care New Orleans people living with HIV surviving twice
the US average of adverse childhood experiences, accessible,
trauma-focused, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for
violence-affected people living with HIV are urgently needed. Objective:
To meet this need, we adapted Living in the Face of Trauma, a
well-established EBI tailored for people living with HIV, into NOLA GEM,
a just-in-time adaptive mobile health (mHealth) intervention. This study
aimed to culturally tailor and refine the NOLA GEM app and assess its
acceptability; feasibility; and preliminary efficacy on care engagement,
medication adherence, viral suppression, and mental well-being among
in-care people living with HIV in Greater New Orleans.Methods: The
development of NOLA GEM entailed identifying real-time tailoring
variables via a geographic ecological momentary assessment (GEMA) study
(n=49; aim 1) and place-based and user-centered tailoring, responsive to
the unique cultural contexts of HIV survivorship in New Orleans, via
formative interviews (n=12; aim 2). The iOS-and Android-enabled NOLA GEM
app leverages twice-daily GEMA prompts to offer just-in-time, in-app
recommendations for effective coping skills practice and app-delivered
Living in the Face of Trauma session content. For aim 3, the pilot trial
will enroll an analytic sample of 60 New Orleans people living with HIV
individually randomized to parallel NOLA GEM (intervention) or
GEMA-alone (control) arms at a 1:1 allocation for a 21-day period.
Acceptability and feasibility will be assessed via enrollment,
attrition, active daily use through paradata metrics, and prevalidated
usability measures. At the postassessment time point, primary end points
will be assessed via a range of well-validated, domain-specific scales.
Care engagement and viral suppression will be assessed via past missed
appointments and self-reported viral load at 30 and 90 days,
respectively, and through well-demonstrated adherence self-efficacy
measures.Results: Aims 1 and 2 have been achieved, NOLA GEM is in Beta,
and all aim-3 methods have been reviewed and approved by the
institutional review board of Tulane University. Recruitment was
launched in July 2023, with a target date for follow-up assessment
completion in December 2023.Conclusions: By leveraging user-centered
development and embracing principles that elevate the lived expertise of
New Orleans people living with HIV, mHealth-adapted EBIs can reflect
community wisdom on posttraumatic resilience. Sustainable adoption of
the NOLA GEM app and a promising early efficacy profile will support the
feasibility of a future fully powered clinical trial and potential
translation to new underserved settings in service of holistic
survivorship and well-being of people living with HIV.Trial

 abstract = {Background: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) cause significant morbidity
affecting 19\% to 34\% of people living with diabetes mellitus. DFUs not
only impair quality of life but may also result in limb loss and
mortality. Patient education has been advocated to raise awareness of
proper foot self-care and the necessity of seeking assistance when a
foot wound occurs. Modern technologies, including mobile health
(mHealth) interventions such as health apps, bring the potential for
more cost-effective and scalable interventions. Objective: This study
aims to examine the feasibility and usability of a newly developed
mHealth app called Well Feet, which is a diabetes and foot care
education app for individuals at risk of developing DFU. Methods: Well
Feet was developed using an evidence-based and expert panel cocreation
approach to deliver educational content available in 3 languages (ie,
English, Chinese, and Malay) via animation videos and a range of
additional features, including adaptive learning. A nonrandomized,
single-arm feasibility study using a mixed methods approach with a
series of validated questionnaires and focus group discussions will be
conducted. In total, 40 patients and carers will be recruited from a
tertiary hospital diabetes clinic to receive a 1-month mHealth
intervention. The primary outcomes are the usability of the app and a
qualitative perspective on user experience. Secondary outcomes include
changes in foot care knowledge, self-management behaviors, and quality
of life. Results: Patient recruitment began in July 2023, and the
intervention and data collection will be completed by the end of
September 2023. This study has been approved by National Healthcare
Group Domain Specific Review Board (2022/00614) on February 10, 2023.
The expected results will be published in spring 2024. Conclusions:
Through this feasibility study, the Well Feet DFU education app will
undergo a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of its
usability and acceptance for future improvement in its design. With
local contextualization, cultural adaptation, and its multilingual
functionality, the app addresses a critical aspect of DFU health
education and self-management in a multiethnic population. Findings from
this study will refine and enhance the features of the app based on user
feedback and shape the procedural framework for a subsequent randomized
controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of Well Feet.},

 abstract = {Background: Digital health technologies are widely used for disease
management, with their computing platforms, software, and sensors being
used for health care. These technologies are developed to manage chronic
diseases and infectious bacterial diseases, including tuberculosis
(TB).Objective: This study aims to comprehensively review the literature
on the use of digital health interventions (DHIs) for enhancing TB
treatment adherence and identify major strategies for their
adoption.Methods: We conducted a literature search in the PubMed,
Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, and Scopus databases for relevant studies
published between January 2012 and March 2022. Studies that focused on
web-based or mobile phone-based interventions, medication adherence,
digital health, randomized controlled trials, digital interventions, or
mobile health and ubiquitous health technology for TB treatment and
related health outcomes were included.Results: We identified 27 relevant
studies and classified them according to the intervention method, a
significant difference in treatment success, and health outcomes. The
following interventions were emphasized: SMS text messaging
interventions (8/27, 30\%), medicine reminders (6/27, 22\%), and
web-based direct observation therapy (9/27, 33\%). Digital health
technology significantly promoted disease management among individuals
and health care professionals. However, only a few studies addressed
2-way communication therapies, such as interactive SMS text messaging
and feedback systems.Conclusions: This scoping review classified studies
on DHIs for patients with TB and demonstrated their potential for the
self-management of TB. DHIs are still being developed, and evidence on
the impact of digital technologies on enhancing TB treatment adherence
remains limited. However, it is necessary to encourage patients'
participation in TB treatment and self-management through bidirectional
communication. We emphasize the importance of developing a communication
system.},

 abstract = {Medication adherence (MA) is a major problem. On average 50\% of chronic
disease management medications are not taken as prescribed While digital
healthcare tools like mobile apps offer benefits such as informative
messages and prescription management, they must be personalized and
offer support across all medication phases to effectively address
individual patient factors and optimize adherence, with room for further
improvements. This scoping review examined the impact of digital health
technologies on MA in adults with diabetes as well as their benefits and
barriers. Using PubMed and Scopus databases, 11 out of 385 studies
(2.86\%) from January 2017 to August 2023 met the criteria for digital
health interventions in diabetes MA, assessed through the Chronic Care
Model. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) is a patient-centered,
evidence-based framework designed to improve the care and outcomes for
chronic illness patients, consisting of six core elements and enhanced
by eHealth tools that facilitate self-management and support through
digital innovations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of
digital health technology in improving medication adherence among adults
with diabetes. Specific digital interventions, including mobile apps
like Gather and Medisafe, SMS text messaging, telemonitoring, and
tailored care management have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing
MA. These interventions have shown positive outcomes, including enhanced
glycemic control and increased patient engagement. Some of the
limitations, which these technologies face, are the poor usability,
digital illiteracy among the patients, low rates of sustainability and
low accessibility among the elderly population. Digital health
technology shows promise in enhancing medication adherence among adults
with diabetes, as revealed in this scoping review. However, ongoing
research is necessary to fine-tune these interventions for improved
outcomes and the overall well-being of individuals with diabetes.
Additional improvement of the technologies and adaptation to the diverse
population might be a good field for exploration.},

 abstract = {BackgroundPatients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer from
repetitive fearful intrusions which they try to neutralize by performing
compulsions. OCD is considered to be the most resistant anxiety disorder
with a remission rate of only 53\% after a year of an evidence-based
treatment. Therefore, it remains an obligation to develop and
investigate more effective treatment interventions. This study aims to
compare personalized exposure with response prevention (ERP) using
experience sampling methodology-based feedback to ERP as usual in
patients with OCD. Personalized exposure will be provided
screen-to-screen in an ecologically valid (real time and real place)
context by means of a smartphone application. This app will also be used
to collect both objective and subjective data by means of experience
sampling methodology (ESM). This ESM data will be used to identify
triggers and protective factors for symptom severity, provide
personalized feedback and optimize the effect of ERP. The primary goal
of this RCT is to compare the effectiveness of personalized ERP to ERP
as usual in the traditional context of a therapist's room in patients
with OCD in OCD symptom severity, as well as differences in quality of
life, depressive symptoms and anxiety states. Since both self-efficacy
and experiential avoidance are known to influence symptom severity in
OCS, a secondary goal is to examine if a possible treatment effect is
mediated by self-efficacy or experiential avoidance.MethodsThis study
involves a randomized controlled trial with 20 weekly sessions by 2
groups (ERP as usual versus personalized ERP), repeated measurements at
baseline (T0), 5 weeks of treatment (T1), 10 weeks of treatment (T2), 15
weeks of treatment (T3), posttest at 20 weeks (T4), 6 weeks follow-up
(T5), 3 months follow-up (T6), 6 months follow-up (T7) and a year
follow-up (T8). A hundred and sixty patients with an OCD diagnosis
according to DSM-5 criteria will participate. Half of the group will
receive exposure with response prevention as usual, the other half will
receive personalized exposure with response prevention with a smartphone
application and personalized feedback sessions based on experience
sampling data. Multilevel mixed modelling analysis will be used to
investigate differences in treatment effect, as well as differences in
quality of life, depressive symptoms and anxiety states. We will use the
macro of Preacher and Hayes and apply bootstrapping methods to assess
the possible mediating effect of changes in self-efficacy and
experiential avoidance on subsequent treatment effects.DiscussionThis
randomized controlled trial is the first to assess the influence of
delivering ERP through video-calling and the use of an ESM intervention
on the symptom severity of OCD. Since the global pandemic COVID-19, the
use of video-calling to deliver psychological treatments has become more
common, increasing the relevance of this study.Trial registrationICTRP

 abstract = {AimRefugees and immigrants face individual and structural barriers in
accessing primary health care (PHC). Digital health technologies have
been proposed as a way to improve access to primary health care
services, yet our understanding of the unique barriers and facilitators
to accessing this form of care among immigrants and refugees remains
limited. A scoping review was conducted to (1) identify the barriers and
facilitators to digital PHC access as experienced by immigrants and
refugees, and (2) to characterize which primary health care needs are
being addressed, and through which digital modalities.Subjects and
methodsWe searched CINAHL, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsychInfo,
Scopus and Web of Science databases for qualitative studies, according
to the Arksey and O'Malley (Int J Soc Res Methodol 8(1):19-32, 2005)
framework.ResultsThe screening process yielded 25 articles included in
the review. Results were analyzed according to Levesque's (2013)
framework of access to healthcare. Access to digital PHC is facilitated
by the flexibility afforded by digital technologies. Digital
technologies also provide an opportunity to form new social connections
through peer support groups and/or check-ins with service providers.
Structural barriers to access include concerns about privacy and data
security.ConclusionThis review provides an overview of the barriers and
facilitators to digital PHC access in immigrant and refugee populations
in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. Our findings
can guide the development of digital interventions that consider the
social and political factors shaping access to care for this population.},

 abstract = {Background Digital media-use disorders (DMUD) in adolescents are a
rising phenomenon associated with psychological distress, comorbid
mental disorders, and high burden on affected families. Since the ICD-11
introduced criteria for gaming disorder, these can now be transferred to
describe additional DMUD associated with social media platforms and
streaming services. Most evidence for effective treatments comes from
cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, interventions based on
theoretical models for adolescents and their parents are widely missing,
leading to a significant clinical gap. Methods Res@t digital
(Resource-Strengthening Training for Adolescents with Problematic
Digital-Media Use and their Parents) is the app-based translation of the
first model-based digital intervention for adolescents with DMUD and
their parents based on CBT. It comprises separate but content-related
modules for adolescents (Res@t-A) and parents (Res@t-P), applying
multimodal techniques. The effectiveness of Res@t will be evaluated
within a multicenter cluster-randomized controlled evaluator-blinded
pre-post follow-up trial with the waitlist control group (CG). In
addition to the Res@t program in the intervention group, both groups
will receive treatment as usual within primary child and adolescent
psychiatric/psychotherapeutic healthcare. The primary outcome addresses
DMUD symptom reduction after 10 weeks. Secondary outcomes are related to
a reduction in psychological and family-related problems and an increase
in parental self-efficacy. All outcomes will be assessed using
standardized self-report measures. A total of 1,334 participating
adolescent-parent dyads from a large clinical network throughout Germany
are planned to be included in the primary analyses based on an
intention-to-treat approach, applying linear mixed models. Discussion
Assuming superiority of Res@t over the control condition, the
intervention has the potential to provide evidence-based treatment for a
significant number of help-seeking families, supporting local healthcare
structures and resources. It is a promising program for practicable
implementation and flexible use in different settings. Clinical trial

 abstract = {Background: Tanzania is 1 of 20 countries where the majority of
unvaccinated and undervaccinated children reside. Prior research
identified substantial rural-urban disparities in the coverage and
timeliness of childhood vaccinations in Tanzania, with children in rural
settings being more likely to receive delayed or no vaccinations.
Further research is necessary to identify effective and scalable
interventions that can bridge rural-urban gaps in childhood vaccination
while accounting for multifaceted barriers to vaccination. Objective:
This protocol describes a type 1 effectiveness-implementation hybrid
study to evaluate Chanjo Kwa Wakati (timely vaccination in Kiswahili), a
community-based digital health intervention to improve vaccination
timeliness. The intervention combines human resources (community health
workers), low-cost digital strategies (electronic communication, digital
case management, and task automation), a vaccination knowledge
intervention, and insights from behavioral economics (reminders and
incentives) to promote timely childhood vaccinations. Methods: The study
will be conducted in 2 predominantly rural regions in Tanzania with
large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated children: Shinyanga and
Mwanza. Forty rural health facilities and their catchment areas
(clusters) will be randomized to an early or delayed onset study arm.
From each cluster, 3 cohorts of mother-child dyads (1 retrospective
cohort and 2 prospective cohorts) will be enrolled in the study. The
timeliness and coverage of all vaccinations recommended during the first
year of life will be observed for 1200 children (n=600, 50\%
intervention group children and n=600, 50\% nonintervention group
children). The primary effectiveness outcome will be the timeliness of
the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine (Penta3). Quantitative
surveys, vaccination records, study logs, fidelity checklists, and
qualitative interviews with mothers and key informants will inform the 5
constructs of the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. The results will be used to develop an
implementation blueprint to guide future adaptations and scale-up of
Chanjo Kwa Wakati. Results: The study was funded in August 2022. Data
collection is expected to last from February 2024 to July 2027.
Conclusions: This study will address the lack of rigorous evidence on
the effectiveness of community-based digital health interventions for
promoting vaccination coverage and timeliness among children from
sub-Saharan Africa and identify potential implementation strategies to
facilitate the deployment of vaccination promotion interventions in
low-and middle-income countries.},

Self-efficacy (PAS) intervention is an online behavioral intervention
newly developed to promote physical activity in adults with obesity by
providing capability-enhancing learning opportunities. The objective of
this manuscript is to describe the protocol for a feasibility study
designed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of
implementing the PAS online intervention for adults with obesity
recruited from a local weight management center in the United States of
America (USA).MethodsThe study design is a prospective, double-blind,
parallel-group individual randomized pilot trial. Thirty participants
will be randomly assigned to the PAS group or usual care group to
achieve a 1:1 group assignment. Recruitment of participants is scheduled
to begin on 1 March 2024 at a local weight management center within a
private healthcare system in the USA. There are six eligibility criteria
for participation in this study (e.g., a body mass index >= 25.00
kg/m2). Eligibility verification and data collection will be conducted
online. Three waves of data collection will take up to 14 weeks
depending on participants' progress in the study. The primary
feasibility outcomes in the study will be: (a) participation rate, (b)
engagement behavior, and (c) a preliminary effect size estimate for the
effect of the PAS intervention on physical activity. Instruments
designed to measure demographic information, anthropometric
characteristics, self-efficacy, and acceptability will be included in
the survey battery. A research-grade accelerometer will be used to
measure free-living physical activity objectively. Data will be analyzed
using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical models under an
intention-to-treat approach.DiscussionResults are intended to inform the
preparation of a future definitive randomized controlled trial.Trial

@article{WOS:001178891200001,
 abstract = {Background Fussy eating is most often a developmentally typical
behaviour, generally presenting during toddler-hood. However, up to half
of parents of young children are concerned about fussy eating, and this
concern may mediate the use of nonresponsive feeding practises, such as
coercive or unstructured feeding and using food to reward eating.
Despite the high prevalence of parental concern for fussy eating and the
negative impacts nonresponsive feeding practises have on children's
health and diets, no previous digital intervention to improve the
feeding practises of parents of toddlers concerned about fussy eating
has been evaluated.
Aim This article describes the protocol of a randomised controlled
feasibility pilot aiming to evaluate Fussy Eating Rescue, a purely web
app based intervention for parents of toddlers. The primary aim is to
investigate feasibility and acceptability; secondary aims are to explore
indications of intervention effect on parents' feeding practises or
children's eating behaviours.
Methods Fussy Eating Rescue features include: (1) a Tracker, that allows
parents to track repeated offers of food, (2) Topics, providing
information on fussy eating, effective feeding strategies, and general
nutrition, (3) Rescues, containing quick references to material
supporting Topics contents, (4) Recipes, and (5) SMS notifications.
Parents of toddlers (12-36 months old, n = 50) who have concerns about
fussy eating will be recruited via Facebook. Parents will be randomised
to an intervention group, which receives access to the app for 6 weeks,
or to wait-listed control. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 6
weeks after app use, using online questionnaires and app usage
statistics. Primary outcomes include participant retention rate,
intervention engagement, app usability, perceived ease in using the app,
perceived usefulness of the app, and user satisfaction. Secondary
outcome measures include parents' feeding practises and children's
eating behaviours.
Discussion Results will inform whether Fussy Eating Rescue is a feasible
way to engage parents concerned for their toddler's fussy eating
behaviours. If feasible and acceptable to users, a larger trial will
further examine the efficacy of the Fussy Eating app in improving
parents' feeding practises and children's eating behaviours.},

 abstract = {Despite the potential of mobile health (mHealth) to address high rates
of depression and anxiety in underserved rural communities, most mHealth
interventions do not explicitly consider the realities of rural life.
The aim of this scoping review is to identify and examine the available
literature on mHealth interventions that consider the needs of rural
populations in order to gauge their feasibility and utility for
addressing depression and anxiety. Additionally, we provide an overview
of rural users' perceptions about and preferences for mHealth-delivered
mental health screening and intervention systems. Out of 169 articles
identified, 16 met inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted across a
wide range of countries, age groups, and rural subpopulations including
individuals with bipolar disorder, anxiety, perinatal depression, PTSD,
and chronic pain, as well as refugees, veterans, and transgender and
LGBTQ+ individuals. All interventions were in the
feasibility/acceptability testing stage for rural users. Identified
strengths included their simplicity, accessibility, convenience,
availability of support between sessions with providers, and remote
access to a care team. Weaknesses included problems with charging phone
batteries and exceeding data limits, privacy concerns, and general lack
of comfort with appbased support. Based upon this review, we provide
recommendations for future mHealth intervention development including
the value of developer-user coproduction methods, the need to consider
user variation in access to and comfort with smartphones, and potential
data or connectivity limitations, mental health stigma, and
confidentiality concerns in rural communities.},

 abstract = {Background Early childhood educators through their daily interactions
with children, play a central role in shaping young children's health
behaviors. Given their influential role, early childhood educators are
often targeted in interventions aiming at enhancing their nutrition and
physical activity practices.Methods This paper presents the design of
the CHEERS eHealth program to improve nutrition and physical activity
practices within Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) centers. The
study has a longitudinal quasi-experimental design with recruitment of
ECECs across Alberta Canada. ECEC intervention group educators complete
12 weekly online nutrition and physical activity modules and participate
in weekly communities of practice sessions to discuss practical
applications within their centers. Outcome assessments are scheduled at
baseline (T1), mid-point at 5 months (T2), and end of program after 10
months (T3). Outcome measures include the Creating Healthy Eating and
Active Environments survey (CHEERS), Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ),
Canadian Behavior, Attitude and Nutrition Knowledge Survey (C-BANKS
2.0), Physical Literacy Knowledge, Attitude, Self-Efficacy, and Behavior
(PLKASB-ECE), the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation
(EPAO) derived variables, and an objective measure of children's
physical activity using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Linear mixed
model analyses will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
intervention. Qualitative assessments comprise exit interviews and
open-response questions embedded within the educational modules.Results
Preliminary baseline data from the 2019 cohort indicate no statistically
significant differences between the intervention and control groups for
the primary outcome variables, except age. Educators' personal
nutrition-related knowledge, attitude and behaviors were positively
associated with their self-assessments of the nutrition environment and
practices in ECECs. A significant correlation was observed between
educators' self-reported physical activity practices and observed
activity practices. The CHEERS survey Food Served subscale showed a
positive correlation with the objective measures of EPAO-Foods Provided
and Nutrition Policy subdomains.Discussion We propose that this eHealth
intervention would be an effective scaling up approach to enhancing the
nutrition and physical activity environments of ECECs by fostering
improved nutrition and physical activity-related knowledge, attitudes,
and adherence to best practices which will potentially lead to improved
outcomes for children in their care.},

 abstract = {Background: Nursing well-being has become a heightened focus since the
COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses are leaving the profession early in their
careers or retiring sooner than expected. Those who remain in the
workforce report higher levels of burnout, anxiety, depression, and
exhaustion. There is concern that there may be a shortage of at least
half a million nurses by 2030. Aims: This systematic review aimed to
investigate the evidence of using a mental health promotion mHealth app
to improve the mental health of hospital nurses. Methods: A systematic
search was conducted in CINAHL Plus with Full Text, MEDLINE with Full
Text, Professional Development Collection, Psychology and Behavioral
Sciences Collection, Sociological Collection, PsycInfo, Embase, and
PubMed with search dates of January 2012-November 15, 2022. The mHealth
intervention needed to be asynchronously delivered through a smartphone
with hospital nurse participants to be included in this review. Results:
Of the 157 articles screened for this review, six were included. Primary
outcome variables were anxiety, burnout, coping, depression,
self-efficacy, stress, well-being, and work engagement. Intervention
types included mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT), stress inoculation therapy (SIT),
psychoeducation, and stress management. Anxiety, depression, well-being,
and burnout improved with MBIs; depression improved with CBT; and
anxiety and active coping improved with SIT. Linking evidence to action:
This review demonstrated promising findings in using mHealth apps to
improve the mental health of hospital nurses. However, more randomized
controlled trials with larger sample sizes may reveal which type of
mHealth app and how much exposure to the intervention is more effective
in improving specific mental health symptoms. Longitudinal follow-up is
also recommended to study sustainability of the mental health
improvements.},

 abstract = {Background: Digital behavior change interventions have demonstrated
effectiveness for smoking cessation and reducing alcohol intake, which
ultimately reduce cancer risk. Leveraging electronic health records
(EHR) to identify at-risk patients and increasing the reach of digital
interventions through proactive electronic outreach provide a novel
approach that may increase the number of individuals who engage with
evidence-based treatment.
Objective: This study aims to increase the reach of digital behavior
change interventions by implementing a proactive electronic message
system for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction among a large,
at-risk population identified through an acute hospital EHR.
Methods: This protocol describes a 3-phase, mixed-methods implementation
study to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and reach of a proactive
electronic message system to digital interventions using a hospital's
EHR system to identify eligible patients. In Phase 1, we will conduct
focus group discussions with patients and hospital staff to assess the
overall acceptability of the electronic message system. In Phase 2, we
will conduct a descriptive analysis of the patient population in the
hospital EHR regarding target risk behaviors and other person-level
characteristics to determine the project's feasibility and potential
reach. In Phase 3, we will send proactive messages to patients
identified as smokers or risky drinkers. Messages will encourage and
provide access to behavior change mobile apps via an embedded link; the
primary outcome will be the proportion of participants who click on the
link to access information about the apps.
Results: At the time of initial protocol submission, data collection was
complete, but analysis had not begun. This study was funded by Cancer
Research UK from April 2019 to March 2020. Health Research Authority
approval was granted in June 2019.
Conclusions: Increasing the reach of digital behavior change
interventions can improve population health by reducing the burden of
preventable death and disease.},

of women each year. Digital health platforms are an easily accessible
intervention that can improve patient care, though their efficacy in
breast cancer care is unknown. This scoping review aims to provide an
overview of existing research on the utilization of digital health
platforms for breast cancer care and identify key trends and gaps in the
literature. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across
electronic databases, including Ovid MEDLINE, Elsevier EMBASE, and
Elsevier Scopus databases. The search strategy incorporated keywords
related to ``digital health platforms{''}, ``breast cancer care{''}, and
associated terminologies. After screening for eligibility, a total of 25
articles were included in this scoping review. The identified studies
comprised mobile applications and web-based interventions. These
platforms demonstrated various functionalities, including patient
education, symptom monitoring, treatment adherence, and psychosocial
support. The findings indicate the potential of digital health platforms
in improving breast cancer care and patients' overall experiences. The
positive impact on patient outcomes, including improved quality of life
and reduced psychological distress, underscores the importance of
incorporating digital health solutions into breast cancer management.
Additional research is necessary to validate the effectiveness of these
platforms in diverse patient populations and assess their impact on
healthcare-resource utilization.},

 abstract = {Background: Black adults who smoke and have HIV experience immense
stressors (eg, racial discrimination and HIV stigma) that impede smoking
cessation success and perpetuate smoking -related health disparities.
These stressors also place Black adults who smoke and have HIV at an
increased risk of elevated interoceptive stress (eg, anxiety and
uncomfortable bodily sensations) and smoking to manage symptoms. In
turn, this population is more likely to smoke to manage interoceptive
stress, which contributes to worse HIV -related outcomes in this group.
However, no specialized treatment exists to address smoking cessation,
interoceptive stress, and HIV management for Black smokers with HIV.
Objective: This study aims to test a culturally adapted and novel mobile
intervention that targets combustible cigarette smoking, HIV treatment
engagement and adherence, and anxiety sensitivity (a proxy for
difficulty and responsivity to interoceptive stress) among Black smokers
with HIV (ie, Mobile Anxiety Sensitivity Program for Smoking and HIV
{[}MASP+]). Various culturally tailored components of the app are being
evaluated for their ability to help users quit smoking, manage
physiological stress, and improve health care management. Methods: This
study is a pilot randomized controlled trial in which Black combustible
cigarette smokers with HIV (N=72) are being recruited and randomly
assigned to use either (1) the National Cancer Institute's QuitGuide app
or (2) MASP+. Study procedures include a web -based prescreener; active
intervention period for 6 weeks; smartphone-based assessments, including
daily app -based ecological momentary assessments for 6 weeks (4
ecological momentary assessments each day); a video -based qualitative
interview using Zoom Video Communications software at week 6 for
participants in all study conditions; and smartphone-based follow-up
assessments at 0, 1, 2 (quit date), 3, 4, 5, 6, and 28 weeks
postbaseline (26 weeks postquitting date). Results: Primary outcomes
include biochemically verified 7 -day point prevalence of abstinence,
HIV -related quality of life, use of antiretroviral therapy, and HIV
care appointment adherence at 26 weeks postquitting date. Qualitative
data are also being collected and assessed to obtain feedback that will
guide further tailoring of app content and evaluation of efficacy.
Conclusions: The results of this study will determine whether the MASP+
app serves as a successful aid for combustible cigarette smoking
cessation, HIV treatment engagement, and physiological stress outcomes
among Black people with HIV infection. If successful, this study will
provide evidence for the efficacy of a new means of addressing major
mental and physical health difficulties for this high -risk population.
If the results are promising, the data from this study will be used to
update and tailor the MASP+ app for testing in a fully powered
randomized controlled trial that will evaluate its efficacy in real
-world behavioral health and social service settings.},

 abstract = {Background: While ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is commonly used
to study social contexts and social influence in the real world, EMA
almost exclusively relies on participant self-report of present
circumstances, including the proximity to influential peers. There is
the potential for developing a proximity sensing approach that uses
small Bluetooth beacons and smartphone-based detection and data
collection to collect information about interactions between individuals
passively in real time. Objective: This paper aims to describe the
methods for evaluating the functionality and validity of a
Bluetooth-based beacon and a smartphone app to identify when >= 2
individuals are physically proximal. Methods: We will recruit 20
participants aged 18 to 29 years with Android smartphones to complete a
3-week study during which beacon detection and self-report data will be
collected using a smartphone app (MEI Research). Using an
interviewer-administered social network interview, participants will
identify up to 3 peers of the same age who are influential on health
behavior (alcohol use in this study). These peers will be asked to carry
a Bluetooth beacon (Kontakt asset tag) for the duration of the study;
each beacon has a unique ID that, when detected, will be recorded by the
app on the participant's phone. Participants will be prompted to respond
to EMA surveys (signal-contingent reports) when a peer beacon encounter
meets our criteria and randomly 3 times daily (random reports) and every
morning (morning reports) to collect information about the presence of
peers. In all reports, the individualized list of peers will be
presented to participants, followed by questions about peer and
participant behavior, including alcohol use. Data from multiple app data
sets, including beacon encounter specifications, notification, and app
logs, participant EMA self-reports and postparticipation interviews, and
peer surveys, will be used to evaluate project goals. We will examine
the functionality of the technology, including the stability of the app
(eg, app crashes and issues opening the app), beacon-to-app detection
(ie, does the app detect proximal beacons?), and beacon encounter
notification when encounter criteria are met. The validity of the
technology will be defined as the concordance between passive detection
of peers via beacon-to-app communication and the participant's EMA
report of peer presence. Disagreement between the beacon and self-report
data (ie, false negatives and false positives) will be investigated in
multiple ways (ie, to determine if the reason was technology-related or
participant compliance-related) using encounter data and information
collected from participants and peers. Results: Participant recruitment
began in February 2023, and enrollment was completed in December 2023.
Results will be reported in 2025. Conclusions: This Bluetooth-based
technology has important applications and clinical implications for
various health behaviors, including the potential for just-in-time
adaptive interventions that target high-risk behavior in real time.},

 abstract = {Background: Digital health tools can support behavior change and allow
interventions to be scalable at a minimal cost. Keep-on-Keep-up
Nutrition (KOKU-Nut) is a free, tablet-based app that focuses on
increasing physical activity and improving the dietary intake of older
adults based on UK guidelines. The intervention targets an important
research area identified as a research priority reported by the James
Lind Alliance priority setting partnership for malnutrition. Objective:
This study aims to assess the feasibility of using the digital health
tool KOKU-Nut among community-dwelling older adults to inform a future
randomized controlled trial. The secondary aims are to determine the
acceptability, usability, preliminary effect sizes, and safety of the
study and the intervention (KOKU-Nut). Methods: This is a feasibility
randomized controlled trial. We plan to recruit a total of 36
community-dwelling older adults using purposive sampling. Participants
will be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention or the control group.
The intervention group will be asked to engage with KOKU-Nut 3 times a
week for 12 weeks. Participants in the control group will receive a
leaflet promoting a healthy lifestyle. All study participants will
complete questionnaires at baseline and the end of the 12 weeks. A
sample of participants will be asked to participate in an optional
interview. The study will collect a range of data including
anthropometry (height and weight), dietary intake (3-day food diary),
physical function (grip strength and 5-times sit-to-stand), perceived
quality of life (EQ-5D), usability (System Usability Scale), and safety
(adverse events). Results: Data collection commenced in March 2024, and
the results will be ready for publication by January 2025. Feasibility
will be determined on the basis of participants' self-reported
engagement with the intervention, and recruitment and retention rates
and will be summarized descriptively. We will also consider the amount
of missing data and assess how outcomes are related to group assignment.
Acceptability will be measured using the modified treatment evaluation
inventory and one-to-one semistructured interviews. Transcripts from the
interviews will be analyzed using NVivo (version 12; QSR International)
software using framework analysis to understand any barriers to the
recruitment process, the suitability of the assessment measures, and the
acceptability of the intervention and study design. Conclusions: The
study aligns with guidelines developed by the Medical Research Council
for developing a complex intervention by using qualitative and
quantitative research to examine the barriers of the intervention and
identify potential challenges around recruitment and retention. We
anticipate that these results will inform the development of a future

 abstract = {The focus of this scoping review is to identify studies, reports, and
other relevant sources from the peer-reviewed and grey literature that
reports on refugee children's access and barriers to portable identity,
education, and health records at different stages during the migration
process. The child refugee crisis has become a global concern as many
individuals risk their lives to escape the political violence,
persecution, and war. Forcibly displaced children face the genuine
challenge of being unable to acquire documents pre-migration or having
documents lost, stolen, or destroyed during transit. Still, little is
known about refugee children's challenges when accessing and maintaining
personal records while moving within and across borders. We will
consolidate existing information and analyze the barriers that limit
access to identity, education, and health records at different stages of
migration and the policies and practices to address record portability
and interoperability problems. This work is part of a program of study
that seeks to understand the institutional, social, and political
aspects of a refugee child's environment that potentiate their
resilience under conditions of extreme stress. The study included
academic literature focused on the production, preservation, or
transmission of records pertaining to identification, education, or
health of refugee children, adolescents, and young adults. The review
process was limited to documents written in the English language. We
employed the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley1 for the
methodological synthesis of research, as well as the modifications
recommended by Levac and colleagues.2 Results of the search strategy
were compiled and presented using the extended reporting guidelines for
scoping reviews, as suggested by the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA).(3) Several bibliographic
and grey literature databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Embase,
Tandfonline, Proquest, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Scopus,
Google Scholar, Google search engine, and UN agency websites, were
searched to identify relevant studies. Using electronic literature
searches, 87 articles were identified, of which 8 were deemed eligible
for inclusion in this study. In addition, we identified 7 news articles
and 10 reports from international organizations, most of which were
focused on issues related to education record portability, as well as
initiatives aimed at recognizing digital credentials for refugee young
people. All eligible documents were categorized into three themes based
on the analysis targets: (1) examining the challenges faced by refugees
in utilizing humanitarian identity systems; (2) highlighting the need
for digital credentials for refugees; and (3) exploring the potential
benefits of digital health interventions for refugees. Specifically, our
search showed that digital identity systems need to be more flexible and
tailored to individual refugee needs. With regard to education records,
the retrieved grey literature prioritizes adults' needs, but adopting
digital credentials and blockchain technology may solve traditional
recognition systems' constraints, ensuring that refugee children's
education is also supported. In contrast, digital health interventions,
including EHRs and mobile health applications, have been better studied
and shown to positively impact healthcare access, patient outcomes, and
chronic disease management for refugees in high-resource host countries.
Despite this potential for positive outcomes, the portability of health
records remains an under-researched and under-resourced area of a
refugee child's life. The increasing number of refugee children globally
necessitates urgent solutions to address their need for portable
identity, education, and health records. This review highlights the
potential of digital interventions to improve refugee children's lives,
including their resettlement outcomes. Furthermore, recent innovations
like blockchain technology and digital credentials offer promising
solutions for advancing equity for refugee children. Developing
adaptable digital solutions and resources can enhance refugee children's
access to health and education services, while also enabling them to
obtain necessary documentation and identity verification for accessing
basic rights and services.},

 abstract = {Background: High -risk alcohol consumption among young adults frequently
occurs in the presence of peers who are drinking. A high -risk drinking
situation may consist of particular social network members who have a
primary association with drinking. Fine-grained approaches such as
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) are growing in popularity for
studying real-time social influence, but studies using these approaches
exclusively rely on participant self -report. Passive indicators peer
presence using Bluetooth-based technology to detect real-time
interactions have the potential to assist in the development of just -in
-time interventions. Objective: This study seeks to examine the
feasibility and acceptability of using a Bluetooth-based sensor and
smartphone to measure social contact in real -world drinking situations.
Methods: Young adults (N=20) who drink heavily and report social
drinking will be recruited from the community to participate in a 3
-week EMA study. Using a social network interview, index participants
will identify and recruit 3 of their friends to carry a Bluetooth
beacon. Participants will complete a series of EMA reports on their own
personal Android devices including random reports; morning reports;
first -drink reports; and signal -contingent reports, which are
triggered following the detection of a beacon carried by a peer
participant. EMA will assess alcohol use and characteristics of the
social environment, including who is nearby and who is drinking. For
items about peer proximity and peer drinking, a customized peer list
will be presented to participants. Feedback about the study protocol
will be ascertained through weekly contact with both index and peer
participants, followed by a qualitative interview at the end of the
study. We will examine the feasibility and acceptability of recruitment,
enrollment participants and peers, and retention. Feasibility will be
determined using indexes of eligibility, enrollment, and recruitment.
Acceptability will be determined through participant enrollment and
retention, protocol compliance, and participant -reported measures of
acceptability. Feasibility and acceptability for peer participants will
be informed by enrollment rates, latency enrollment, compliance with
carrying the beacon, and self -reported reasons for compliance or
noncompliance with beacon procedures. Finally, EMA data about peer
proximity and peer drinking will support the validity of the peer
selection process. Results: Participant recruitment began in February
2023, and enrollment was completed in December 2023. Results will
reported in 2025. Conclusions: The protocol allows us to examine the
feasibility and acceptability of a Bluetooth-based sensor for the
detection of social contact between index participants and their
friends, including social interactions during real -world drinking
situations. Data from this study will inform just -in -time adaptive
interventions seeking to address drinking in the natural environment
providing personalized feedback about a high -risk social context and
alerting an individual that they are in a potentially unsafe situation.},
